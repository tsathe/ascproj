Aortic fibroblasts are highly dynamic cell populations that play critical roles in repair and remodeling in aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD). However, their molecular and cellular changes during AAD development remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined aortic fibroblast heterogeneity in a sporadic AAD mouse model using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice were either unchallenged (chow diet, saline infusion; n=3) or challenged (n=3) with 4 weeks of high-fat diet followed by 7 days of angiotensin II infusion. Thoracic aortas were excised and digested to generate single-cell suspensions for scRNA-seq. In all,16,187 cells were analyzed and categorized by using the Seurat package in R to perform cluster identification. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using edgeR. Trajectory pseudotime analyses were performed using Monocle2.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified 7 major aortic cell populations including one cluster of Pdgfra<sup>high</sup> fibroblasts. We further divided this cluster into 7 subclusters including extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing fibroblasts (with enrichment in Dcn, Lum, and Col1a2), Acta2<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts, Tnfrsf11b<sup>high</sup> fibroblasts, mesenchymal progenitor cells (with enrichment in Cd34, Ly6a, and Ly6c1), pro-inflammatory fibroblasts (with enrichment in Col8a1, Thbs1, and Tgfb3), and Cd14<sup>+</sup> macrophage-like fibroblasts (expressing myeloid-specific markers Lyz2, Cd68, and Pf4). DEGs and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses revealed specific gene expression patterns distinguishing these fibroblast subsets and uncovered their putative functions, such as increased collagen synthesis and ECM organization in ECM-producing and pro-inflammatory fibroblasts, increased cell proliferation and migration features in Tnfrsf11b<sup>high</sup> and pro-inflammatory fibroblasts, and increased cell adhesion and cell junction organization in myofibroblasts and mesenchymal progenitor cells. Notably, pseudotime analyses suggest an important role of Tnfrsf11b in fibroblast trajectory differentiation. Interestingly, while ECM-producing fibroblasts, Acta2<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts, Tnfrsf11b<sup>high</sup> fibroblasts, and mesenchymal progenitor cells were detected in both unchallenged and challenged mice, pro-inflammatory fibroblasts and macrophage-like fibroblasts were almost exclusively detected in challenged mice.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
&nbsp;This study revealed marked phenotypic heterogeneity of aortic fibroblasts and identified changes in fibroblast gene expression during aortic stress, suggesting specialized functions of fibroblast subclusters. Our findings will open up novel opportunities to understand the role of fibroblasts in AAD formation and progression.

Yang<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Virginia,Surgery,Charlottesville, VA, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Arizona,Surgery,Tucson, AZ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;We have identified&nbsp;a novel cardio-splenic axis that is activated and exacerbates myocardial infarct size (IS) during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). HMGB1 and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are released from ischemically-injured myocardium into the bloodstream during reperfusion. Facilitated by the interaction between HMGB1 and RAGE on splenic leukocytes, cfDNA enters the leukocytes, stimulates cytosolic TLR9 and augments inflammatory responses, ultimately exacerbating myocardial IS.&nbsp;Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a well-known antimalarial agent and has recently been found to inhibit TLR7/9.&nbsp;We hypothesized that HCQ would attenuate myocardial IRI by inhibiting interferon I-mediated inflammatory responses.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and congenic TLR9<sup>-/-</sup>&nbsp;mice underwent 40 minutes of ischemia following treatment with TLR9 inhibitor ODN-2088, HCQ, or control 5 min prior to left coronary artery (LCA) occlusion. After 60 minutes of reperfusion, hearts were harvested and IS as a percentage of risk region (RR, % of LV) was measured by TTC-Phthalo blue staining. Ex vivo, isolated splenocytes were treated either with PBS or cardiac perfusate (CP) containing high levels of cfDNA and HMGB1 collected from hearts harvested after 40 minutes of LCA occlusion without reperfusion. Cell culture supernatant was then collected at 2 and 4 hours to measure&nbsp;IFN&alpha;&nbsp;and IFN&beta;.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In WT mice treated with ODN-2088, ODN negative control, or PBS control and TLR9<sup>-/-</sup>&nbsp;mice, there was no significant difference in RR (p=NS). In&nbsp;TLR9<sup>-/-</sup>&nbsp;mice&nbsp;and&nbsp;OND-2088-treated WT&nbsp;mice (0.6&nbsp;&mu;&nbsp;g/g mouse weight), IS was significantly decreased to&nbsp;26&plusmn;8 &amp; 28&plusmn;4% respectively, a &gt;49% reduction compared to WT mice treated with PBS (53&plusmn;4%, p&lt;0.05, Figure A). ODN-2088 negative control (0.6&nbsp;&mu;g/g) had no infarct-sparing effect (p=NS, vs. WT control). In WT mice treated with HCQ, RR was comparable among the control and 3 HCQ-treated groups. All 3 HCQ-treated mice (at dosages of 5, 10 and 20&nbsp;&mu;g/g) had significantly reduced IS (vs. WT control, p&lt;0.05), with the 10 ug/g dose decreasing IS to 33&plusmn;6% (39% reduction from WT control). A trend towards HCQ dose-response in IS reduction was present but did not reach statistical significance.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Figure B). In the ex vivo experiment, CP-treated splenocytes produced significantly higher IFN&alpha;&nbsp;and IFN&beta;&nbsp;in culture supernatant at 4 hours. HCQ significantly reduced the production of&nbsp;IFN&alpha;&nbsp;and IFN&beta;.



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;HMGB1 and cfDNA released from ischemic myocardium during reperfusion exacerbate myocardial IS by activating TLR9/IFN I-mediated inflammatory responses. Hydroxychloroquine reduces production of IFN I and attenuates myocardial IRI, likely via TLR9 inhibition.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is known to be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the glycoprotein fibrillin-1 (FBN1), however the molecular and cellular processes leading to progression of disease remains poorly understood. Aortic endothelial cells (ECs) are vital in the maintenance of the normal aortic wall, with involvement in permeability, cell-cell signaling, and mechanotransduction. Here, we used single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing to define the EC populations and cell-specific gene expression in patients with MFS compared to controls, hypothesizing that ECs in MFS would exhibit evidence of endothelial dysfunction.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed scRNA sequencing of aneurysmal ascending aortic tissues from patients with MFS (n=3) undergoing aneurysm repair and of age-matched non-aneurysmal control tissues from cardiac transplant donors and recipients (n=4). Tissues were digested and single cells isolated and sequenced. In all, over 46,000 cells were grouped into clusters based on similar conserved gene expression using the Seurat package in R. ECs were identified based on high expression of known marker genes, such as VWF, and were re-clustered for dedicated analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using edgeR.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified a total of 2,218 ECs in our data which were grouped into 8 clusters. Marker gene expression in each cluster identified EC clusters associated with innate immunity (n=3; marker genes associated with complement pathways and antigen presentation), vascular healing (n=3; marker genes associated with mechanical stress, remodeling, and vascular development), proliferation (n=1; marker genes associated with cell cycle progression), and de-differentiated ECs (n=1; marker genes associated with matrix production and smooth muscle contraction). Module scores of genes involved in tight and adherens junctions were highest in the vascular healing ECs, indicating that these cells were most involved in maintenance of the endothelial barrier. Cells from MFS tissue had a higher proportion of vascular healing ECs compared to controls. Analysis of DEGs revealed that ECs in MFS exhibited significant downregulation of claudin-5 (CLDN5), the predominant tight junction gene expressed in our data. Genes most consistently significantly upregulated in MFS ECs included genes involved in vasculogenesis such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and NOTCH1.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We identified unique subpopulations of aortic ECs using scRNA sequencing. When compared with controls, MFS tissues had a higher proportion of ECs involved in maintaining the endothelial barrier, however had downregulation of CLDN5, the predominant tight junction gene in our data. Additionally, genes involved in vasculogenesis were significantly upregulated. Together, this suggests dysfunction of the endothelial barrier in MFS with increased endothelial cell migration and proliferation.

Brekken<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,Hamon Center For Therapeutic Oncology Research,Dallas, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Macrophages are key regulators of the immune landscape within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the plasticity of macrophage phenotypes in the TME correlates with prognosis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Depending on their phenotype, macrophages in the TME can secrete pro-tumorigenic cytokines and chemokines, ultimately suppressing the function of other immune cells in the TME. The purpose of our study was to investigate how individual NSCLC cell lines alter macrophage phenotype in tumor cell, cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and macrophage co-cultures and to relate effects to the molecular characteristics of different NSCLCs. We hypothesize that immune suppression occurs through tumor-secreted signaling molecules that if identified and blocked, could alleviate macrophage-mediated immune suppression, resulting in improved anti-tumor immune responses

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We developed an in vitro organoid co-culture system (NSCLC tumor cells, human CAFs, and mouse macrophages) to interrogate cancer cell features causing heterogeneity of macrophage phenotypes across a panel of NSCLCs. We measured (with 4-7 replicates for each NSCLC cell line): mRNA expression in mouse macrophages with a panel of qPCR probes for important macrophage related genes (Arg, NOS2, IL-1&beta;, IL-6, CHIL-3, SOCS3), and in selected cases, whole genome RNAseq; and protein expression using cytokine arrays measuring expression of 40 inflammatory cytokines. Positive controls were stimulation with LPS and IL-4.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Using our platform, we characterized over 70 NSCLC patient derived lines for their effects on mouse macrophage phenotype. We found: 1) the macrophage phenotypes induced by any one NSCLC were highly reproducible; 2) CAFs are important in the co-culture polarization of macrophages 3) three major clusters of cancer polarized macrophage phenotypes: high Arg (immune suppressive), high IL-1&beta; (inflammatory) or high SOCS3 (JAK-STAT3 pathway) expression; 4) major oncogenotypes (KRAS, TP53, STK11, EGFR, BRAF) do not correlate with the induced macrophage phenotype. We selected 10 NSCLC &ldquo;exemplars&rdquo; lines representing each of these 3 clusters for RNA sequencing (mouse genes) and cytokine array protein (human) profiling. Across all clusters we found: 1) suppression of macrophage endocytosis pathways and activation of scavenger receptor A (SRA) signaling (M2 immunosuppressive phenotype); 2) increased expression of human IL6, IL8, and MCP1 proteins, which have been implicated in suppressing innate immune tumor sensing.&nbsp; Analyses of differences between the 3 clusters is ongoing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Patient derived NSCLC preclinical models have reproducible effects on macrophage phenotypes in co-cultures. Three major classes of NSCLC cell lines, which are not linked to oncogenotype, initiated reproducible macrophage alteration. Cytokines secreted by NSCLC cell lines appear responsible for these macrophage changes and this system provides an experimental platform to systematically test each as potential therapeutic targets.

Laubach<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University of Virginia Health System,Surgery,Charlottesville, VA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury after lung transplantation is a major cause of early graft dysfunction and increases the risk of early morbidity and mortality. Purinergic P2Y2 receptors (P2Y2R) are G-protein coupled receptors that are known to modulate the inflammatory response by enhancing inflammatory cell infiltration and activation. This study tests the hypothesis that P2Y2R modulates lung IR injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), P2Y2R-/-, and endothelial-specific P2Y2R (VECadCreP2Y2Rfl/fl) mice were subjected to lung IR or sham surgery using an&nbsp;in vivo&nbsp;left lung hilar-ligation model (1-hour ischemia, 2 hours reperfusion; n=3-11 mice/group). Left lung-specific partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) was then measured to determine pulmonary function. Lung injury was assessed using wet-to-dry weight (WTD) ratio, and lung compliance was measured using a buffer-perfused isolated lung system. Murine lung primary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVEC) were exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR, 6 hours/4 hours) as a lung IR surrogate and treated with either&nbsp;P2Y2R inhibitor (AR-C 118925XX, 10&micro;M) or vehicle to quantify the secretion of CXCL1 cytokine as an endothelial inflammatory marker. Data is presented as mean +/- SEM.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Compared to WT, significantly improved oxygenation as measured by PaO2 following IR occurred in P2Y2R-/- mice (468.2&plusmn;33.1 vs 133.1&plusmn;13.2 mmHg, p&lt;0.001) and in VECadCre+P2Y2Rfl/fl mice (401.3&plusmn;78.6 vs 133.1&plusmn;13.2 mmHg, p&lt;0.001) (Figure). Similarly, a significant decrease in lung edema as measured by WTD ratio following IR occurred in P2Y2R-/- mice (4.86&plusmn;0.15 vs 5.51&plusmn;0.09, p=0.008) compared to WT. Lung compliance following IR was significantly improved in P2Y2R-/- mice (28.91&plusmn;0.84 vs 14.86&plusmn;0.83&nbsp;&micro;l/cm H<sub>2</sub>O, p&lt;0.001) compared to WT. In vitro experiments using PMVECs showed a multifold increase in CXCL1 production following HR, which was mitigated with treatment of P2Y2R inhibitor (p=0.025).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our results suggest that P2Y2R modulates the pulmonary inflammatory response following IR. This modulation is largely due to P2Y2R activity on pulmonary endothelium. P2Y2R may be a promising new therapeutic target to decrease the incidence of primary graft disfunction following lung transplantation.&nbsp;

Optimal chance for mesothelioma cure is predicated upon R0 resection and sound surgical principles, which often is not possible due to extensive nature of the disease and inability to discern malignant cells using visual and tactile feedback. &nbsp;Fluorescence guided surgery can ameliorate these challenges and aid in detection of residual disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in-vivo sensitivity of a novel fluorescent dye (VGT-309) in detection of malignant mesothelioma.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All experiments were approved by the IRB and were conducted in accordance to policies set forth by the office of University Laboratory Animal Resources.&nbsp; Athymic 15-week old BALB/c female mice were injected with 1 million AB12 cells (mouse derived mesothelioma cells) which were grown in supplemented R10 media.&nbsp; Subsequently, after tumor burden reached 250mm<sup>3</sup>, the mice were injected with 100 uL of vehicle solution of VGT-309 at differing doses. Animals were then imaged at 15-minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours using near-infrared (NIR) imaging. The organs and tumor cells were retrieved after 48 hours for histopathological evaluation of dye accumulation. Signal to Background Ratios (SBR) were measured to quantify fluorescence using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
All the animal subjects tolerated the procedure well without adverse effects attributable to VGT-309 administration.&nbsp; After 48 hours, tail vein injection at 2mg/kg and 4 mg/kg demonstrated consistent fluorescence in AB12 cells in all the mice under NIR imaging. Strongest fluorescence (15,000 A.U) was detected after 24 hours of drug delivery compared to earlier time points and 48 hours. Furthermore, malignant mesothelial cells showed strongest fluorescence (12,500 absorbance units (A.U)) versus various visceral organs including pancreas, liver, stomach, bowel, and lung with mean A.U of 5300 (Figure 1). Immunohistochemical and histopathological analysis confirmed the selective accumulation of the dye in the tumor compared to background healthy tissue. Mean SBRs for tumor tissues were noted to be 3.48 and 4.12 at 24 and 48 hours respectively. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We have demonstrated that the novel VGT-309 dye can safely and reliably accumulate in malignant mesothelial cells as well as be detected using conventional fluorescence equipment. Implementation of this dye in surgical treatment of mesothelioma patients can aid in higher chance of R0 resection and subsequently increase the 5-year survival rates. Further studies in animals are needed to assess the efficacy of tumor dye accumulation.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in the United States with a 25% lifetime risk, and accounts for one-third of all cardiovascular diseases. Treatment and care associated with AF costs roughly $26 billion/year in the US alone and accounts for 10% of all Medicare spending. Debilitating complications linked to AF include heart failure and stroke. AF risk is resoundingly linked to common variation at the 4q25 locus, implicating cis-regulation of the transcription factor PITX2. PITX2 is expressed in left atrial (LA) myocardium where it has been implicated as underlying AF phenotypes in both patients and animal models. Although animal models of Pitx2 are susceptible to AF, the direct mechanisms regulated by Pitx2 remain undetermined. To understand the molecular drivers of AF, it is imperative to understand both the upstream regulation and downstream targets of PITX2.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using Pitx2 gene-edited mice, we have performed a compendium of single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and single nuclei assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq) experiments to identify the role of Pitx2 in LA myocardium.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Using the snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq datasets, we identified differentially expressed genes with differentially accessible chromatin sites in both the cardiomyocyte and fibroblast populations of the LA. Among the genes in the LA cardiomyocytes, we see a reversal of left and right atrial expressed genes.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
AF is a complex genetic disease with many underlying genetic and physiological variables. In this work, we have begun laying the groundwork to understand the direct molecular mechanisms governed by Pitx2 in the LA myocardium. In future work, we hope to investigate the cis-regulatory mechanisms of PITX2 at candidate loci identified in this study. Additionally, we plan to identify the molecular machinery by which PITX2 interacts to govern the cis-regulatory landscape of the LA myocardium in development and disease.

Recent advancements in endoscopic surgery have spurred a rise in endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for the treatment of early stage esophageal malignancy. Complications from EMR/ESD include stricture formation, full thickness injury, delayed perforation, and leak. &nbsp;Therefore a more complete understanding of the mechanisms that govern esophageal epithelial regeneration following injury is needed to prevent the occasionally lethal complications. &nbsp;Here, we describe a simple model for culturing whole esophageal explants long term, providing a platform for potentially studying regeneration ex vivo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

C57/BL6 wildtype mice were sacrificed and underwent sternotomy and laparotomy. The esophagus was dissected, opened longitudinally, and then either completely immersed in media or transferred atop a gelfoam sponge impregnated with media (DMEM/F12 with HEPES and Penicillin/Streptomycin). Following culture, tissues were fixed and cryosectioned in standard fashion. H&amp;E staining was used to analyze explant architecture.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
After the esophagus is completely immersed in culture for 5 days, there is loss of normal esophageal architecture characterized by atrophy of the esophageal mucosa. In contrast, when the esophagus is cultured atop a gelfoam sponge (mimicking an air-liquid interface), mucosal architecture is maintained. Furthermore, these explants also showed signs of mucosal proliferation, as evidence by an enlarged zone of keratinization. Additional studies demonstrated that this novel culture platform was able to maintain esophageal explants for up to 17 days without significant distortion of architecture.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Long term whole organ esophageal explants can be maintained without compromising tissue integrity. This platform provides a novel yet simple method for potentially studying the process of esophageal regeneration following both superficial (i.e EMR) and deep (ESD) simulated injury in the mouse.

Our group and others have found increased Th17 activation in diabetic wounds results in increased IL17a and pathologic inflammation that prevents tissue repair. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are antigen presenting cells (APCs) that are present in early diabetic wound tissue and may play a key role in modulating CD4+T cell phenotype. Hence, we hypothesized that&nbsp;&nbsp;pDCs in diabetic wounds may activate CD4+ T-cells towards a Th17 phenotype.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Wild type C57BL/6 mice were fed normal chow diet (13.5% kcal fat) or high fat diet chow (60% kcal fat) for 12-14 weeks to generate the diet-induced obesity (DIO) model of glucose intolerance/insulin resistance. These mice were subsequently wounded with 6 mm punch biopsies, and wound pDCs were examined by flow cytometry daily for 5 days. In another cohort of mice, wounds were created and pDCs were harvested on day 1. These cells were co-cultured with wild type, na&iuml;ve CD4+ T-cells for 5 days, after which T-cell phenotype was determined by flow cytometry for established transcription factors and extracellular markers.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Following exposure to DIO pDCs, wild type activated CD4+ T-cells were polarized towards a Th17 phenotype, demonstrating increased I17a production. Further, DIO pDC recruited to wounds resulted in decreased Th2/IL-4 producing T-cells, that are&nbsp;&nbsp;important for normal wound repair. Further, there were kinetic differences seen in pDC recruitment to DIO versus control wounds following injury.&nbsp;

This cleavage prevents spontaneous pro-thrombotic VWF-platelet interaction in circulation while maintaining the hemostatic activity of VWF at the site of vascular injury. After trauma, ULVWF multimers are released as part of the acute phase reaction. When ULVWF release overwhelms the proteolytic capacity of ADAMTS-13 this safeguard is bypassed, potentially contributing to the coagulopathy of trauma.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Fifty plasma samples from 30 trauma patients were evaluated and compared to 21 healthy volunteers. The patients were stratified by injury type including traumatic brain injury (TBI), Long Bone Fracture (LBFx) and need for any blood transfusion (TX). We assessed the plasma concentrations of VWF:Ag and ADAMTS-13:Ag, and the Rapid Enzyme Assays for Autoimmune Diseases (REAADS) activity of VWF, which measures the binding of a monoclonal antibody to an exposed epitope in the A1 domain. Kruskal- Wallis test for significance was performed on all subgroups, and results are presented in Table 1 against previously obtained thrombin generation data for the same patients.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: As compared to healthy volunteers, thrombin generation is enhanced in trauma patients, especially those that required any blood transfusion (Table 1). In all trauma patients, the VWF:Ag levels were elevated relative to controls. In addition, the REAADs activity was greater, especially in those with TBI. ADAMTS-13:Ag levels were also moderately reduced in all trauma patients, and this was most apparent in those with TBI.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These data demonstrate that trauma patients, especially those with TBI, have enhanced exposure of the VWF A1 domain (activated VWF) based on increased REAADS activity. The increase in REAADS activity coupled with the decrease in free plasma ADAMTS-13:Ag in all trauma patients, may indicate that ADAMTS-13 is not efficiently cleaving ULVWFs in these patients. Further investigation with a larger cohort is merited to assess whether VWF has any clinical significance in Trauma-induced Coagulopathy, such as in the development of venous thromboembolism.&nbsp;

M. McCaughan<sup>1,2</sup>, C. Pulitano<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,Transplantation Surgery,Sydney, NSW, Australia <sup>2</sup>University of Sydney,Faculty Of Health And Medicine,Sydney, NSW, Australia","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The shortage of quality donor organs has resulted in the widespread use of sub-optimal livers in clinical transplantation. Marginal grafts are particularly susceptible to injury after procurement during the period of static cold storage. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP), where metabolic activity is maintained, is a potential alternative to impove the preservation of marginal grafts. If the safe preservation of metabolically active grafts can be extended for multiple days, an opportunity arises to introduce therapeutic agents and further optimise these organs. The accumulation of metabolic waste, however, limits the current utilisation of NMP beyond 24 hours. It is the aim of this study to evaluate the technical feasibility of prolonged (5-day) normothermic perfusion of discarded liver grafts with modifications to our current NMP system.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Six discarded human liver grafts were perfused for 120 hours after the development of a newly adopted perfusion system incorporating: 1) long-life oxygenators; 2) a dialysis membrane; and 3) continuous parenteral nutrition. Perfusate volume consisted of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, concentrated albumin and crystalloid. In addition to homogenous perfusion and stable vascular flows, the viability of the grafts was assessed at 4 hours, and then every 24 hours for five days using: 1) maintenance of pH; 2) lactate &lt;2.5mmol/L; 3) production of bile; and 4) biliary pH &gt;7.4. Hepatocellular injury, protein synthesis, and clearance of water-soluble by-products were assessed using alanine transferase (ALT), coagulation factor V and urea levels respectively.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Five of six livers met all viability criteria after 72 hours, and three of six at 120 hours. One organ failed to reach viability criteria at all time points. Two livers initially failed to meet criteria due an inability to produce alkaline bile that that resolved over the perfusion duration. Five of six livers demonstrated a down-trending ALT after a peak within 24 hours. Initially low levels of factor V increased to &gt;75% in five of six livers during perfusion. Clearance of water-soluble metabolic by-products was evident by a stable urea concentration from day 1 to 5 across all grafts. Macroscopic pressure necrosis was evident to varying extents in all grafts at the conclusion of perfusion. Two grafts demonstrated macroscopic evidence of fungal infection.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study sucessfully demonstrates the technicaly feasibility of preserving metabolically active human livers for 5 days using NMP. The sensitivity of current real-time viability criteria, however, have significant limitations that create challenges in the assessment of therapeutic agents that may be introduced in the future. Prior to this approach transitioning to clinical transplantation the validation of alternative viability criteria and alternative strategies to overcome both pressure necrosis and infection must be overcome.&nbsp;

Beck<sup>1</sup>, H. Chen<sup>1</sup>, B. Ren<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>The University of Alabama at Birmingham,Surgery,Birmingham, ALABAMA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are highly vascularized and heterogeneous neoplasms, which are characterized by high levels of VEGF and its receptors, the potential driver in PNET metastasis. An antiangiogenic drug known as sunitinib has been approved for the treatment of PNETs. However, the therapeutic efficacy is limited because of relapse and metastasis. Therefore, tailoring antiangiogenic therapy to patients requires novel insight of tumor angiogenesis. Our previous studies suggested that PKD-1 signaling stimulates arteriolar differentiation (a key process in functional angiogenesis) via the Notch pathway and promotes tumor progression. We hypothesize that PKD-1-stimuated arterial differentiation plays an essential role in PNET progression by development of a unique vascular niche.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: To test this hypothesis, we developed a co-culture system for growing human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) with PNET cells using a Boyden Chamber technique.&nbsp;To define the molecular mechanisms by which PKD-1 signaling regulates PNET progression, we knocked down endogenous PKD-1 expression and characterized malignant behavior of PNET cells using Clonogenic and tumor invasion assays. Furthermore, real-time RT-qPCR was used to evaluate the transcriptional expression of genes associated with arteriolar differentiation and tumor progression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Compared with the scramble control, PKD-1 knockdown in HMVECs decreased the formation of colonies and impaired the invasive potential of PNET cells. Unexpectedly, co-culture of control HMVECs with PNET cells showed clear formation of many colonies with tumorsphere-like morphology. However, when these cells co-cultured with PKD-1-deficient HMVECs, the number of spheres was significantly reduced.&nbsp; At molecular levels, knocking down PKD-1 in HMVECs reduced mRNA expression of ALDH1A1, VEGFR2 and Notch1 but increased CD36 expression when co-cultured with PNET cells. Intriguingly, silencing PKD-1 in HMVECs downregulated mRNA levels of KLF2, Myc, ALDH1 and Snail 1 (a transcriptional factor for epithelial mesenchymal transition) in PNET cells.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This study indicates that there is a crosstalk between endothelial cells and PNET cells to promote arteriolar differentiation, in which PKD-1 signaling may play a key role. Cancer cell-mediated arteriolar differentiation via the PKD-1 pathway may contribute to the progression of PNETs by serving as a unique vascular niche in the tumor microenvironment.

Type B aortic dissections (TBADs) have historically been treated with surgery or medical management, depending on the presence of complications. The advent of&nbsp;thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has necessitated a reconsideration of the treatment paradigm due to its reduced peri-operative risk profile but significant long-term complication rate. The guidelines regarding TEVAR versus open surgery still remain in flux and will require greater clarification in the future, particularly with regards to the best choice to reduce complications. We hypothesize that accurate guidance in choosing between endovascular and open repair can be provided by computational characterization of aortic surface geometry, specifically using two indices of surface curvature: the Koenderink shape index, which measures shape, and curvedness, which measures the intensity of the shape. Here, we demonstrate our method of analysis by comparing two TBAD patients with similar non-complicated dissections but distinct post-operative outcomes.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We study two TBAD patients (A and B) with non-complicated dissections but two distinct post-operative clinical outcomes: aortic remodeling with false lumen thrombosis and failed remodeling with post-procedural complications (type 1A endoleak).&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilizing CTA imaging, pre- and post-op segmentations of the aortic wall are&nbsp;performed. The curvature tensor is calculated for a mesh of each geometry, allowing us to measure the principle curvatures (k<sub>1</sub>,k<sub>2</sub>). Using the Koenderink shape index, s = 2/&pi;&nbsp;arctan((k<sub>1</sub>+k<sub>2</sub>)/(k<sub>1</sub>-k<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;)), and curvedness, c = &radic;((k<sub>1</sub>+k<sub>2</sub>)^2/2),&nbsp;we measure characterize aortic shape by plotting &quot;2D&quot;&nbsp;histograms of s&nbsp;versus c&nbsp;over each meshed aortic surface. We then calculate statistics of each distribution.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The figure summarizes our results comparing patient A and B. Although the mean shape index, mean curvedness, and variance in shape index values are similar (0.475 vs. 0.481, 0.0352 vs. 0.0412, 0.0640 vs. 0.0641), patient A has a smaller variance in curvedness than patient B (0.00194 vs. 0.000341). This is visually reflected by the larger vertical spread of high intensity regions for patient B.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Despite relatively similar presentation of&nbsp;non-complicated dissections, the two patients in this study experience different outcomes. Computing the shape index and curvedness values provides a novel and more comprehensive view of the surface geometry. We saw that the variance in curvedness was able to distinguish between a patient with positive post-operative outcomes and a patient with post-operative complications. We hope to determine if our method of analysis holds predictive power with a larger patient set.

As telehealth use increases in surgery, especially as a response to COVID-19, communication increasingly relies on conversation. It is unclear, however, if variations exist in these conversations that may be amenable to improvement.&nbsp;This study aimed to understand the relationship between patient and physician speech on understandability in patient-surgeon telehealth encounters.
<!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]-->
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: New and returning telehealth surgical patients for six surgeons at the UAB Colorectal Clinic (June-July 2020) were recruited and consented. Health literacy was measured using the Brief Health Literacy Screening Tool (BRIEF). Patient-surgeon conversations were audio-recorded during telehealth visits. Recordings were transcribed and analyzed for questions asked, length of visit (LOV), and understandability of words by&nbsp;the Flesch-Kincaid Ease Score (FKES), Flesh Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Gunning-Fog Index (GFI), Coleman-Lau Index (CLI), and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Twenty-four patients were enrolled. The mean age was 49.5 years (+/- 12.7) and 66.7% were female. Health literacy levels were adequate (11 patients, 45.8%), marginal (10 patients, 41.7%) and low (3 patient, 12.5%). Speech between surgeons varied by understandability and LOV. Overall average LOV was 10 minutes and 3 seconds (+/- 6 minutes and 40 seconds) among all surgeons (N=24). Overall average SMOG score was 5.2 (+/-1.2) and overall average FKES was 84.3 (+/-6). Lower understandability was associated with longer LOV (p&lt;0.0003), longer physician speaking time (p&lt;0.0003), and more words spoken by physician (p&lt;0.0009). However, higher percentage words spoken by patient was associated with higher understandability (p&lt;0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Length of visit and understandability vary among surgeon speech during patient-surgeon telehealth encounters. Longer physician speaking time is significantly associated with less understandable words while more speaking time for patients is associated with more understandable encounters. Creating an environment where patients with low health literacy are able to speak more and ask more questions may help improve patient understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, not all patients choose to enroll in a PET and the reasons are unclear. This study examines if patient demographics or insurance status are associated with patients declining to enroll in a PET.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients undergoing elective colorectal, thoracic, cardiac, and gynecological oncology surgery at a single institution were approached about enrolling in a PET (SeamlessMD) at their preoperative clinic visit. For patients who enrolled, healthcare reminders, educational content, PRO surveys, and health checks were distributed via the PET preoperatively, in-hospital, and for up to 30 days post-discharge. Patients who decided not to enroll were recorded and went through usual surgical care. Patient age, sex, race, and insurance status were compared between patients who elected to enroll in the PET at the initial clinic visit and patients who declined to enroll in the PET. Groups were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test and independent t-test with alpha value of 0.05 determined a priori.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Between 2018-2020, 1699 patients were approached about enrolling in the PET. 1609 (94.7%) elected to enroll, while 90 (5.3%) declined. Median age varied significantly between the groups, with median age of 60 for patients who enrolled compared to 66 for those who refused (p&lt;0.001). Insurance status also varied significantly. Of patients who enrolled, 47.3% had Medicare/Medicaid, 41.8% were privately insured, and 10.9% were uninsured or charity care. Of patients who declined, 78.7% had Medicare/Medicaid and 21.4% of patients were privately insured (p&lt;0.001). Patients who refused were more likely to be Black or African American, however this difference was not statistically significant (37.5% vs 30.7% for enrolled patients, p=0.24). There was no difference in PET enrollment by sex.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Older patients and patients who are not privately insured are more likely to decline PET enrollment. While PETs can be useful technology for navigating the surgical journey, they may not be universally adopted or provide benefit to all patients. Considerations should be made for complementary or alternative resources for these non-PET patients.

Relative to urban populations, patients living in rural areas have an increased incidence of cancer and reduced survival, among other disparities. We sought to determine whether patient rurality was a driver of hospital cost for patients undergoing colectomy for colon cancer.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All patients undergoing colectomy for primary colon cancer at an academic medical center were queried from 2014 to 2019. Institutional cancer and cost accounting databases were combined, and patients were stratified into urban (1-3) and rural (4-10) cohorts by rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes. Bivariate analysis comparing the rural-urban cohorts and index hospitalization cost was conducted with student&rsquo;s t-test, ANOVA, linear regression, and Kaplan Meier log rank analysis as appropriate. Relevant variables were entered into a multivariable linear regression to identify pertinent drivers of hospital cost. Significant variables on multivariable linear regression were reported as the beta (change in $ per unit change) with an associated 95% confidence interval.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;

279 urban and 142 rural patients were included in the final analysis. Rural patients were more likely to be non-Hispanic white (p=0.02), have lower alcohol use (p=0.03), differ in their insurance payor (p=0.02), undergo an open operation (p&lt;0.01), be further from the treating institution (p&lt;0.01), and have a worse median recurrence free survival (23.1 months vs. 27.1 months, p=0.04). On bivariate analysis, no differences in hospital cost was found between urban and rural patients ($12,151.16 vs. $13,082.61; p=0.42).

These findings were affirmed on multivariable linear regression analysis ($484.84; CI -1,699.69-2,637.38; p=0.67) after controlling for patient-related factors including age, race, rurality, insurer and ASA class, tumor-related factors including TNM staging and grade, and operative factors including operative time, open vs. laparoscopic procedure, and type of colectomy performed. Instead, on multivariable analysis (Table 1), statistically significant drivers of hospital cost included ASA class, T stage, operative time, and operation performed.



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;While differences between rural and urban patients undergoing surgical treatment for colon cancer exist, our results demonstrated no association between rurality and hospital cost. This persisted with multivariable analysis, suggesting that although patient rurality may affect various aspects of cancer care, institutions are able to provide the same high value care at costs similar to urban patients.

In Brazil, in 2018, in male population, among all new cases of cancer, CRC was the third most common. In the female population, CRC was the second most common. As there are disparities of health care among high-, low-, and middle-income countries, also there are disparities within the countries. Therefore, this study aims to verify, among the five geographic regions of Brazil, the disparities of estimation of new cases of CRC for 2020 and the surgical treatments for this tumor performed in 2019 by Unique Health System (SUS).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We analyzed the estimation data of new cases of CRC for 2020 from the National Cancer Institute (INCA)&nbsp; and the data of surgical treatments for this tumor performed by Unique Health System (SUS) in 2019. We compared the data of North, Northeast, South, and Central-West Regions to the data of the Southeast Region, which is the most developed region in Brazil, to verify among these regions&nbsp;the possible differences&nbsp;of estimation of new cases of CRC and surgical treatments. To base this analysis we used the estimation of Brazilian population for 2019 from Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: With a population of 88 million inhabitants and a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0,753, Southeast Region has an estimation of 24.260 new cases of CRC for 2020 (INCA). For North Region, this estimation is 1100 new cases (18 million inh.; HDI 0,690), Northeast is 5760 (57 million inh.; HDI 0,658), South is 7370 (29 million inh.; HDI 0,756) and Central-West is 2520 (16 million inh.; HDI 0,753). If the estimation of new cases were proportionally the same as the Southeast, which is the region of greatest socio-economic relevance in Brazil, the North region would have an estimation of 5060 new cases, 360% more than the present estimation. In the Northeast region there would be 15667 new cases, 172% more than the current estimation. For surgical treatments performed by SUS, if the North Region had the same rate as the Southeast Region, there would be an increase of 418% in surgical treatments, in Northeast the&nbsp;increase&nbsp;would be 132%, and in Central-West there would be an increase of 62%. The only region that&nbsp;proportionally&nbsp;performed more surgeries than Southeast&nbsp;was South Region.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is a significant disparity among regions of Brazil concerning estimation of new cases of CRC and surgical treatments. If all Brazilian population had the same treatment and diagnostic screening rates as Brazilian Southeast population has, more inhabitants would have access to health care and&nbsp;the burden of cancer could be reduced.&nbsp;

Centralization of care has been increasingly discussed as a means to improve outcomes following high-risk cancer surgery. Prior studies assessing survival of&nbsp;patients with colorectal cancer have reported better outcomes when operations are performed at high-volume centers, with both lower complication rates and lower mortality rates, while others have suggested that differences in outcomes&nbsp;are related to degree of surgeon specialization rather than case volume. We aim to examine the association between facility volume and survival following proctectomy for rectal cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The National Cancer Database was used to identify all patients who underwent proctectomy for rectal cancer between 2004-2016. Facility volume was determined by&nbsp;the frequency of proctectomy for rectal cancer based on a facility&rsquo;s unique ID, and was divided into tertiles &ndash; low, intermediate, and high. Median overall survival and 5-year survival for the patient cohort was compared between facility volume tertiles. Log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier survival statistics were used for comparison.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A&nbsp;total of 158,764 patients were included. Facilities were divided into low, intermediate, and high volume tertiles. When analyzing facility volume by facility type, for high volume facilities, 57% were academic and 38% were non-academic; for low volume facilities, 11% were academic, while 86% were non-academic&nbsp;(p&lt;0.001).&nbsp;Median survival was 91.9 months (95%CI 90.1 &ndash; 93.5) for low volume facilities, 103.2 months (95%CI 101.3 &ndash; 105.5) for intermediate volume facilities, and 114.2 months (95%CI 111.9 &ndash;&nbsp;116.7) for high volume facilities, with differences between tertiles statistically significant (p&lt; 0.001). 5-year survival rates for the three tertiles were&nbsp;62.5% (95%CI 62.0 &ndash;&nbsp;63.0) for low volume, 65.4% (95%CI 64.9&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;65.8) for intermediate volume, and 68.5% (95%CI 68.1&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;69.0) for high volume (p&lt;0.001). The corresponding Kaplan-Meier graph is presented in Figure 1:&nbsp;Overall survival following proctectomy for rectal cancer by facility volume.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This study identifies a strong association between facility volume tertile and survival following proctectomy for rectal cancer. Further work is needed to evaluate drivers of this association, whether there is a causal effect of facility volume on survival, and whether this relates to specialist expertise, compliance with treatment guidelines and delivery of standard of care, or other factors.

Hospital discharge materials contain tremendous amounts of health information, but it is unclear if these materials are readable, understandable and actionable. The aim of this study was to assess surgical discharge materials for these parameters with the hypothesis that discharge materials are not readable, understandable or actionable.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Discharge materials for a colorectal surgery service were collected from a single-institution. Readability, understandability and actionability were assessed by 3 independent reviewers using validated and complementary instruments: (i) Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), (ii) Gunning-Fog Scale (GF), (iii) Coleman-Liau Index (CL), (iv) Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), (v) Automated Readability Index (AR), (vi) Linsear Write Formula (LW), (vii) Flesch Reading Ease (FRE), (viii) Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT), and (ix) Print Communication Rating (PCR). Scores were averaged and compared across discharge materials to identify areas for improvement.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;79 discharge items covering 131 pages were collected for analysis. On readability assessments, discharge materials were mostly written below the 8th grade reading level by all readability tests except the GF (9.82 &plusmn; 0.44) and CL (9.67 &plusmn; 0.15). On assessment of understandability and actionability, discharge materials scored poorly including 55.92% &plusmn; 5.34% understandability and 42.18% &plusmn; 7.03 actionability by PEMAT (indicating readers&rsquo; difficulty to process key points and identify their role within the information presented) and 73.24% &plusmn; 3.10 PCR (indicating adequate presentation of information or directions but in need of improvement). Lowest scoring domains were opioid pain medication instructions (9.8 GF, 10.1 CL, and 60.3 FRE), laparoscopic colectomy information (11.5 GF, 10.4 CL, and 62.8 FRE), and forms on topics ranging from tobacco use to a health app (10.5 GF, 11.5 CL, and 59.8 FRE).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;While most discharge materials were written below the 8<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, major opportunities exist for improving their understandability and actionability. Key areas of improvement include using more visual aids, simplifying content, and providing examples for medical terminology. Future studies will focus on improving discharge materials to make them more understandable and actionable.

Arriaga<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>IBM Watson Health,Cambridge, MA, USA <sup>2</sup>Vanderbilt University Medical Center,Nashville, TN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Time to surgery has been a well-known quality metric for colon cancer management, with evidence supporting improved clinical outcomes for patients who receive prompt versus delayed surgical therapy. We investigated trends and patient-related factors associated with time to surgery in a cohort of insured patients with colon cancer.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A cohort was identified from the IBM&reg; MarketScan&reg; database from January 2013 to December 2018. Inclusion criteria entailed patients 18 years and older with an initial diagnosis of non-metastatic colon cancer undergoing surgery within 6 months of diagnosis, with continuous insurance enrollment from 12 months pre- to 6 months post-diagnosis. Claims for surgery within six months after diagnosis were evaluated. Temporal trends for time to surgery were estimated by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Logistic regression identified factors associated with time to surgery.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In this study, 20450 patients with non-metastatic colon cancer had surgery within 6 months of diagnosis. Median age was 62 years (IQR = 20 years), and 9998 (49%) were female. Median time to surgery was 13 days. A statistically significant difference in time to surgery was found comparing 2013 (median 12 days) to 2018 (median 16 days) (p &lt; 0.0001). Factors associated with undergoing expedited surgery (within 1 week of diagnosis) included: older age (p=0.05), female sex (p = 0.016), coronary artery disease (p=0.014), smoking (p &lt; 0.0001), dementia (p =0.001), hemiplegia or paraplegia (p = 0.001), renal disease ( p=0.029), and resident of US South (p=0.012) or US Midwest (p=0.03). &nbsp;Conversely, male sex (p=0.027), residency outside of the US West (p=0.022), obesity (p&lt;0.001), severe liver disease (p=0.011), and myocardial infarction (p=0.019) were associated with a higher likelihood of delayed surgery (greater than 1 month after diagnosis).

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: For patients with non-metastatic colon cancer, time to surgery demonstrated a significantly increasing trend from 2013 to 2018. Numerous demographic, clinical, and geographic factors were associated with expedited or delayed time to surgery. Identifying these factors may provide insights into the groups of patients at risk for delayed surgical treatment and could support interventions to optimize surgical outcomes and foster equitable delivery of surgical care.

The perioperative journey is complex and difficult to navigate for patients and their families. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes after colorectal surgery between patients enrolled in a 1-year pilot of a technology-augmented ERAS pathway compared with historic controls enrolled in a paper-based pathway.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Adult patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery from 6/11/2020&ndash;7/9/2020 were included in this study, as part of an ongoing 1-year pilot. Patients were enrolled on a commercially available patient engagement and data collection platform, which allows for the delivery of reminders, surveys, and educational materials created by our institution&rsquo;s colorectal surgery service via a mobile app, text messages, and/or emails. Surveys delivered include patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires and daily health checks meant to aid in the early detection of complications. The primary outcome was 30-day readmissions compared to historic controls. Secondary outcomes included preoperative anxiety, engagement and satisfaction with the platform. Patient anxiety was measured using the PROMIS-anxiety survey and patient engagement was ascertained by the completion of daily health checks and PRO surveys. Satisfaction with the platform was measured using the system usability scale (SUS) and the net promoter score (NPS).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 40 patients were enrolled on the platform. Their mean age was 53.0 &plusmn;16.6 years old, 48.8% were female, 90% were White; 23 (57.5%) patients downloaded the mobile app. Compared to historic controls, patients using the platform had a lower rate of 30-day readmissions (10% vs 19%) and felt less nervous/anxious before surgery (11.4% vs 22.7% often/always). App users opened it an average of 2.9 times per day. Out of 280 daily health checks delivered, 187 (67%) were completed, with 86% of patients completing at least 3 of them. Postoperative PRO collection rates were 67.8% at 1 week, and 50% at 3 weeks, an increase from previous rates of approximately 10% using paper-based surveys. Most patients felt the platform was easy to use (69.2% agree/strongly agree) and its functions were well integrated (76.9% agree/strongly agree), with an overall NPS of 70%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

The addition of a patient engagement and data collection technology platform to aid in the delivery of an existing ERAS pathway appears to have benefitted patient care, both with regards to outcomes as well as patient experience, satisfaction, and PRO collection. We expect the benefits of this technology to become even clearer as our 1-year pilot progresses, and we reach our projected total enrollment of 600 patients (50 additional have been enrolled since 7/9/2020). As mobile technologies become even more widespread and ubiquitous, it is incumbent upon us to adapt the way we deliver care and take advantage of these resources, to ultimately provide our patients with the outcomes and surgical experience they deserve.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs in approximately 10% of patients following major abdominal cancer surgery. Recent practice guidelines recommend the routine use of VTE prophylaxis for 28 days following surgery, typically extending prophylaxis beyond hospital discharge. We sought to characterize and compare awareness, agreement, adoption, and adherence to these guidelines among colorectal and hepatobiliary surgeons.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We electronically surveyed Canadian hepatobiliary surgeons registered with the Canadian Hepatopancreatobiliary Association, and, general surgeons and colorectal surgeons registered with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario and the Canadian Society of Colorectal Surgeons, respectively, who provide care for patients with colorectal cancer with a pilot-tested questionnaire. Attitudes to relevant guideline recommendations and perceived barriers to post-discharge VTE prophylaxis were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale. Comparisons between specialties and attitudes towards guidelines were performed using 1-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There were 128 responses (response rate 60%, 128/213), including 60 general/colorectal and 68 hepatobiliary surgeons. Most surgeons (122 /128, 95%) were aware, agreed (101/122, 83%), adopted (78/101, 77%) and adhered (74/78, 95%) with post-discharge VTE prophylaxis guidelines[MOU1]&nbsp;[CG2]&nbsp;. Hepatobiliary surgeons, compared to surgeons performing colorectal cancer surgery were more likely to agree (94% vs. 69%), adopt (88% vs. 59%) and adhere (98% vs. 86%) with these guidelines. Insufficient evidence (median Likert: 4, IQR 3-5) and low incidence of VTE (median Likert: 4, IQR 3-4) were cited as the strongest barriers among respondents that did not agree with post-discharge VTE prophylaxis. Surgeons that agreed but did not adopt post-discharge VTE prophylaxis programs reported that the most significant barriers were cost (median Likert: 4, IQR 3-4), low support from surgical colleagues (median Likert: 4, IQR 4-4) and difficulty of subcutaneous injections (median Likert: 4, IQR 3-4), whereas surgeons that adhered additionally reported &ldquo;logistical challenges of prescribing&rdquo; as one of the greatest barriers to implementation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
There remains apprehension regarding implementation of post-discharge VTE prophylaxis following abdominal cancer surgery among non-hepatobiliary surgeons, citing poor evidence and cost of the medication as the major barriers. Uptake among hepatobiliary surgeons versus surgeons performing colorectal cancer surgery was higher.

The role of vulnerability has been widely discussed&nbsp;as a requirement for continuous&nbsp;professional development. Yet, we understand little about this concept in surgeons. Given the nature of surgery, which values confidence, it remains challenging for surgeons to embrace vulnerability. This study explores surgeons&rsquo; experiences and views on vulnerability in the context of a group surgical coaching intervention.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Data for this study is part of an ongoing longitudinal qualitative study exploring expert learning among 14 Michigan surgeons participating in a surgical coaching program. For a more diverse perspective, we conducted one-on-one in-depth interviews with an additional 68 colorectal surgeons across the U.S. to gauge attitudes and perceptions around surgical coaching. The 82 interviews were analyzed in a team-based approach and results are reported thematically.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Surgeons reflected on three main themes surrounding vulnerability including technical, social, and the importance in continuous&nbsp;professional development. Participants described coaching as an event that may situate the surgeon as technically vulnerable. Technical vulnerability relates to reluctance to adapt to new surgical techniques, fear of displaying techniques to peers, and knowledge about challenging cases. Surgeons also discussed social vulnerability or threats to a surgeon&rsquo;s&nbsp;professional identity. Participating surgeons were critical of their mannerisms during coaching sessions and cognizant of the social hierarchy of surgeon &ldquo;rock stars&rdquo; in the room. For non-participants, many suggested that social vulnerability may be related to intersectional identities such as race, class, age, geography, or practice setting. For example, being the &ldquo;old guy in the room&rdquo;, or as one woman reported, &ldquo;When you are being put out there&hellip;everyone is going to be like this proves that she doesn&rsquo;t know or she really doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be here. And I just want to hide.&rdquo; Lastly, participants and non-participants alike reported that they welcomed opportunities for technical or social vulnerability, stating its importance in the field of medicine. Participants in our study negotiated these vulnerabilities as they described deep-rooted beliefs that vulnerability was essential to the surgeon identity and a mechanism for technical and cultural improvement.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Surgeons discussed technical and social vulnerability as pervasive among surgical coaching interactions. Participants also described the reasons why they believed both vulnerabilities are imperative in order to continue to improve professionally. Our results indicate the necessity of promoting a constructive, collaborative environment so that vulnerability can be nurtured in positive ways. This qualitative analysis illustrates the significance of vulnerability in surgical coaching interventions and continual professional development.

Previous studies were small and limited by confounding as surgeons may have selected lower risk patients for laparoscopy. We therefore studied the effect of attempting laparoscopy for emergency colectomies while adjusting for confounding using multiple techniques on large national databases.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data, we identified emergency colectomy cases from 2014 to 2018. We first compared outcomes between patients who underwent laparoscopic versus open surgery, while adjusting for baseline variables using both propensity scores with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and regression. Next, we performed a negative control exposure analysis using the apparent benefit of laparoscopy in cases converted to open. By assuming that the group which converted to open did not benefit from the attempt at laparoscopy, we used the observed benefit to bound the effect of unmeasured confounding on our estimates. Finally, we analyzed the effect of laparoscopy in the National Inpatient Sample (2009-2011) using an instrumental variable (IV) analysis, with an instrument based on proportion of cases done laparoscopically at each institution.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 21,453 patients meeting criteria, 3,867 underwent laparoscopy, of which 1,375 converted to open. In both IPTW and regression analyses, attempting laparoscopy was associated with improved 30-day mortality, overall morbidity, anastomotic leak, surgical site infection (SSI), post-operative septic shock, and length of hospital stay (LOS) as compared to open surgery (Figure, Panel A). These effects do not appear to be driven by unmeasured confounding, as they were consistent with the lower bounds computed from the converted group (Figure, Panel B). IV analysis confirmed improved mortality and shorter LOS for laparoscopy.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Laparoscopic surgery for colorectal emergencies improves outcomes compared to open surgery. The benefit is observed even after adjusting for both measured and unmeasured confounding using multiple statistical approaches, thus suggesting a benefit not attributable to patient selection.

Inspired by the landmark work that showed the benefit of surgical coaching, the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative Video Colectomy Project was designed to improve surgeon technical skill and patient outcomes by expanding on coaching frameworks through group video based formative feedback.&nbsp;However, little is known about surgeons&rsquo; experience with surgical coaching, which is an emerging field. We performed qualitative interviews of surgeons participating in our Video Colectomy Project as well as non-participating surgeons across the U.S.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Data for this study is part of an ongoing longitudinal qualitative intervention with colorectal surgeons in the state of Michigan. To inform our ongoing research, we interviewed 14 surgeons participating in the Video Colectomy Project as well as 68 colorectal surgeons across the U.S. to gauge attitudes and perceptions around surgical coaching. Interviews were coded in a team-based approach.&nbsp;We report our results thematically.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Participants and non-participants&nbsp;had little familiarity with surgical coaching. Most surgeons outside the state of Michigan revealed they had never heard about the practice.&nbsp;However, after hearing a brief description, participants &ldquo;welcomed&rdquo; and were &ldquo;excited&rdquo; about opportunities for technical improvement.&nbsp;Surgeons who participated discussed motivations to participations: desire to improve technically and peer affirmation.&nbsp;Surgeons differed in what formal technical improvement feedback should look like with responses most often paralleling what surgeons believed was culturally appropriate or feasible to their practice. Some were most interested in a group video coaching model while others were envisioning a one-on-one intraoperative surgical coach.&nbsp;When discussing logistics, most surgeons believed that professional surgical societies should offer some form of peer technical improvement opportunities.&nbsp;Some surgeons discussed coaches for skills outside of the operating room, such as managing ethical dilemmas or communication skills with difficult patients or colleagues.&nbsp;Surgeons considered several barriers to a successful surgical coaching program, including surgeon time, required vulnerability, technical concerns, and the ability to make a coaching program relevant to all surgeons.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Surgeons were attracted to the concept of surgical coaching to improve their technical skills and for continued professional development.&nbsp;However, surgeons had varying views about the ideal surgical coaching program and recognized many challenging barriers to widespread adoption.&nbsp;We hope to continue to develop our surgical coaching program based on our participating surgeons&rsquo; experiences and continued feedback.&nbsp; We also hope to deliver both technically and culturally appropriate coaching for surgeons nationwide.

Colonoscopy is an important tool in both pre-operative diagnosis and post-operative surveillance of colorectal cancer. Within our healthcare system there have been incidental polyps found on pathology after surgical resection that were not detected on pre-operative colonoscopy.&nbsp; This portends the possibility that additional polyps may have been missed and remain in the colon.&nbsp;In addition,&nbsp;over 50% of patients nationally are non-compliant with guidelines for postoperative surveillance colonoscopy.&nbsp; Further elucidation of the significance of incidental polyps and its potential effect on surveillance is needed.&nbsp; Therefore, the objective our study was to determine the relationship between unexpected polyp on colectomy specimen and findings on post-operative surveillance colonoscopy.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

&nbsp;A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients that underwent colorectal resection at our institutions from 2018 to 2019. &nbsp;Surgical pathology reports were reviewed for identification of any polyp.&nbsp; If detected, pre-operative colonoscopy report was referenced to determine if any lesion was expected.&nbsp; Incidental polyps were stratified based on reason for being missed on pre-operative colonoscopy.&nbsp; Each chart was then reviewed for post-operative colonoscopy report, including any identification of new lesion. Odds ratio was used to compare the incidence of new lesion on post-operative colonoscopy between the cohort with incidental polyp on colectomy specimen versus the cohort without incidental findings.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;

243 colorectal resections were performed at the two institutions between 2018 and&nbsp;2019.&nbsp; Incidental polyp was noted in 60 cases (24.7%). The most commonly identifiable reason was suboptimal bowel prep on pre-operative colonoscopy (n=15, 25%).&nbsp; In this cohort, post-operative colonoscopy has been completed in 47 cases (19%). Of these cases, new polyp was detected in 18 cases (38.3%).&nbsp; Of those, 9 were identified in patients with incidental polyp in operative specimen, and 9 were identified in patients without incidental polyp.&nbsp; Therefore, the patients with incidental polyp on operative specimen were over three&nbsp;times more likely to have polyp found on interval colonoscopy (unadjusted odds ratio 3.41, 95% confidence interval 1.29 to 9.05, p=0.01).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;

Our results show a high incidence of unexpected polyp on surgical specimen, as well as a higher rate of lesions detected on post-operative colonoscopy within this cohort. &nbsp;Therefore, incidental findings on final surgical pathology may be interpreted as a risk factor for the presence of other missed lesion still within the patient.&nbsp; Given suboptimal compliance with surveillance within our cohort and nationally, it is imperative that providers and patients understand the potential implications that these incidental lesions confer.&nbsp; Therefore, we must strive for high quality pre-operative colonoscopies and consider potential modification of surveillance interval on a&nbsp;case by case basis.&nbsp;

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are a common non-opioid analgesic used for postoperative pain control. Ketorolac is an NSAID that has been utilized sparingly in the postoperative period due to a presumed increased risk of bleeding. Although this relationship has been examined in various surgical disciplines, the association between ketorolac and bleeding has not yet been studied in colorectal surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This is a retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy between 2015 and 2018 at a single institution for benign and malignant indications. Patients were sorted into two cohorts based on postoperative ketorolac administration. Perioperative data and outcomes including hemoglobin, hematocrit, blood transfusions received, length of stay and need for operative reintervention were collected.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
420 patients who underwent laparoscopic colectomy were included in the analysis. Patients receiving ketorolac (n=131) were compared to those who did not (n=289). There were no significant differences in sex (p=0.07), ethnicity (p=0.4), race (p=0.4), resection type (p=0.1), or operative length (p=0.2). In terms of postoperative outcomes, there were no significant differences in estimated blood loss (p=0.3), blood transfusion requirements (p=0.6), or reinterventions for bleeding (p=0.6). Daily hemoglobin and hematocrit trends were similar between these two groups in the first three postoperative days. Additionally, those receiving ketorolac were found to have a significantly shorter hospital length of stay (p=0.002) and quicker return to bowel function (p=0.01), despite no differences in 30-day readmission (p=0.5) and complication rates (p=0.4).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Ketorolac use after colorectal surgery is not associated with an increased risk of clinically significant postoperative bleeding and is associated with decreased length of stay and quicker return to bowel function. The conclusions from this study are limited by the retrospective methods used which are subject to selection bias. Further blinded randomized control studies are required to further elucidate the risks of postoperative bleeding with ketorolac.

There has been an increasing trend towards the consolidation of hospitals into networks with Hub (HH) and Spoke (SH) hospitals. Theoretically, this consolidates complex care from smaller SH into their HH to improve efficiency and patient outcomes. The SH also financially benefit by sharing in the increased bargaining power of the growing network. Limited evidence exists on the achievement of this purported goal. We sought to examine the differences in costs and outcomes at HH and SH using a colorectal resection model.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using state discharge data from 5 geographically diverse states (2013 to 2016), we identified patients greater than 18 years of age who underwent a colon or rectal resection (CRS) at a networked hospital. Colorectal resection was used given the inclusion of common and complex cases, and the detectable rate of adverse events. Networked hospitals were included when the entire hospital network was contained within the 5 study states. HH were defined as those that performed over 75% of the rectal surgeries for that network. All other hospitals within that network were designated as SH. Financial and clinical outcomes were compared between HH and SH using mixed-effects multivariate regression models. Costs were calculated in 2016 USD. Analyses were performed for colon and rectal resections separately.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of 13,565 CRS patients included in the study, mean age was 61.5 years, 53.5% were female, and 77.3% were white. Differences were seen in the distribution of patients treated at Hub and Spoke hospitals (see Table). The characteristics of the hospital differed between the HH and SH. For example, the mean number of beds in HH was 254.8 (SD 123.9), relative to 74.4 (SD 67.2) at SH.

In the linear regression models, performing colon operations at HH was found to be more expensive than at SH ($1,872.59, p &lt; 0.001, 95%CI: $967.00 - $2,778.18). An even greater effect was found for rectal operations ($3,533.66, p = 0.004, 95%CI: $1,137.78 - $5,929.54). In the mixed-effects logistic regression models, there was a 55% decreased odds of complications (OR 0.55 95%CI: 0.44-0.69; p &lt; 0.001) among patients that underwent colon operations at HH. However, there was no difference in the rates of death or 30-day readmissions between HH and SH for rectal or colon resection.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Colorectal resections performed at HH are associated with higher costs and lower odds of complications than those performed at SH. The use of the Hub and Spoke model in hospital network consolidation may be an effective approach to achieving high-value care when patients are distributed fluidly to the hospitals ideally suited to their unique needs.

The cost to hospital systems in the setting of post-operative complications of colectomy is not clearly defined. Financial penalty for SSI after colectomy as part of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program was established in 2017. Perioperative bundles have been promoted to decrease SSIs after colectomy. This project is intended to provide information to health systems on the effects of post-operative complications on fixed (FC) and variable costs&nbsp;(VC) to systems, surgery time, and length of stay (LOS) within our system in 4 different categories of colectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Colectomy cases were collected from 3 major centers within our system in 2019. Administrative data was mined to evaluate the number of colectomy cases with complications within 4 categories, including colectomies above and below the peritoneal reflection (PR), with and without diversion. Expense by accounting category was evaluated per case. Complications reported from our concurrent reporting system were&nbsp;compared to administrative secondary diagnosis codes to assess the accurate identification of complications following colectomy and evaluate financial and LOS cost. Net revenue, FC, VC, surgery time (mins), and LOS (days)&nbsp;were evaluated on cases with and without post-operative complications. Total margin was calculated by subtracting FC and VC&nbsp;from revenue.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 922 colectomy cases in 2019, 144 (15.6%) sustained complications. Complications were associated with increased FC and VC in all four categories. Colectomy above PR without diversion had the greatest increase in both FC (45.95%) and VC (40.51%). In colectomy below PR, total margin was decreased with complications vs. without, both with and without diversion. Over all categories, average LOS was increased with complications v. without (14.57 v. 9.18 days). Surgery time and LOS increased by more in the setting of colectomy below the PR, regardless of diversion. With complications, LOS increased by 4.53 days (39.81%) in colectomy below PR without diversion and 4.18 days (41.42%) with diversion. Total LOS excess of 5.39 and surgery time excess of 337.22 minutes is directly related to opportunity cost.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Morbidity of colectomy complications includes financial, LOS and opportunity costs to health systems and clinical morbidity to patients. Excess LOS was approximately 5.39 days across categories. Our data suggests&nbsp;that the excess financial cost is greatest in colectomies below PR with and without diversion. Total margin in colectomy decreased by $3473.79 per case below PR with diversion and $5465.23 without diversion.

Morris<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,General Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Treatment of colorectal cancer often requires a multidisciplinary approach and national accreditation requires rectal cancer patients to be evaluated in a multidisciplinary clinic (MDC). We evaluated an MDC&nbsp;for colorectal cancer and its effect on time to evaluation and treatment.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We queried our institutional ACS NSQIP database for all patients undergoing surgical intervention for colorectal cancer between January 2017 and February 2020. Clinical characteristics, sociodemographic factors, insurance status, and timelines for diagnosis and treatment were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into those seen in MDC or not. Our primary endpoint was the time to start treatment (TST), either initiation of neoadjuvant therapy or surgery from the date of diagnosis, which was defined as the date of colonoscopy. Wilcoxon and Kruskal Wallis tests were used for continuous and categorical data, respectively, at an alpha level of 0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 405 patients were evaluated: 115 patients in the MDC cohort and 290 controls. The overall median age was 61.8 years (IQR, 52.0-69.6) and 52.4% were men.&nbsp; There was no difference between MDC and standard clinics in terms of time from diagnosis to complete staging for rectal cancer patients (13 vs 14 days; p=0.48). There was also no significant difference between the groups TST for all patients with colorectal cancer (30 vs. 37 days;&nbsp;p=0.07). When comparing MDC to control groups for initial treatment, median time to start of neoadjuvant therapy (30 vs 34 days; p=0.28) and time to surgery (32.5 vs 38 days, p=0.35) from initial diagnosis were not statistically different. We further examined impact of social determinants of health on MDC visits. TST from diagnosis for MDC patients with different insurance types (Medicare/Medicaid 32 days, Private 30 days, Self-pay 23 days; p=0.51), ethnicities (Caucasian 32 days, African American 32 days, Hispanic 14 days; p=0.12), and distances from the clinic (&lt;50miles 29 days, &gt;100miles 30 days; p=0.76) were similar. When comparing MDC to controls, TST from diagnosis for Caucasians (32 vs 35 days; p=0.17) and minorities (28 vs 41 days; p=0.19) as well as for people who were self-pay (23 vs 38 days, p=0.26) or had any type of insurance (30 vs 37 days; p=0.12) were decreased, but not to a significant degree.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Implementation of an MDC provides slight but not significant reduction in time to start of treatment for colorectal cancer patients as compared to regular clinics bringing into question this requirement for accreditation.

Tohme<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Pittsburgh,Pittsburgh, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The recent use of more effective chemotherapy and the development of surgical procedures have expanded the pool of resectable patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). However, the recurrence rate remains high for patients with CRLM undergoing resection. Observational and preclinical studies have suggested that Metformin has antitumor effects in many solid tumors including colorectal cancer. Thus, we aimed to assess recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) among individuals with CRLM undergoing surgery with or without postoperative prescriptions for metformin.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This cohort study obtained data from the electronic health record of a multicenter, single health care system. Included were adults with CRLM who underwent liver surgery with curative intent between 2010 and 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on their use of Metformin after surgery as documented in the electronic medical record. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess RFS and OS among the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among the 270 individuals who underwent resection for CRLM, 62 (23%) were on metformin. There were no significant differences in tumor characteristics (CEA level, size of largest tumor, number of tumors, among others) between the groups. Patients on Metformin had significantly longer RFS (HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.26-0.75, p&lt;0.002) with a median RFS of 63 months versus 39 months compared to patients not on metformin. On multivariable analyses the use of metformin was independently associated with prolonged RFS (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32-0.94, p&lt;0.028). Similarly, patients on Metformin had significantly longer overall survival (OS) (HR: 0.60, 95% CI 0.31-0.97, p&lt;0.048) with a median OS of 87 months versus 67 months. Compared to patients not on metformin.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Metformin exposure in patients with CRLM undergoing surgery may be associated with improved recurrence-free and overall survival. Further studies are warranted to evaluate if there is a therapeutic role for metformin in the treatment of CRLM.

Water is a scarce and precious resource in many parts of the world and in the context of achieving appropriate surgical hand scrubbing this calls into question if alternative hand sanitization techniques are equally effective. Hand scrubbing or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers are the available options for preparation prior to surgery. The COVID -19 pandemic has reemphasized the importance of handwashing and sanitization. As the world is moving back to opening the surgical procedures once again, we looked at the impact of water consumption and cost associated with this common practice.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This is a&nbsp;&nbsp;quality improvement project, members of the surgical team were asked to scrub &amp; amount of flowing water for&nbsp;5 minutes was collected in a measuring bucket.&nbsp;The hospital sinks are equipped with either manual or automatic motion sensor taps. This was reflected in the total amount of water and cost that was calculated for the operative cases of 2019.&nbsp;An estimate of water consumption was calculated using the mean of participants&rsquo; scrub time.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

An average of 3 minutes was the scrub time for the 6 participants, including 2 senior surgeons, 1 senior resident, 1 junior resident, and 2 scrub nurses. Six operation theatres had manual tap sinks and 3 had motion sensor tap sinks, both taps&nbsp;had water flow rate of 6 liters&nbsp;per minute. Thirty liters of water was consumed&nbsp;using a manual tap sink with continous water flow in 5 minutes. In comparison&nbsp;just 7.5 liters of water was&nbsp;consumed&nbsp;using a motion sensor tap sink in&nbsp;5 minute. &nbsp;Overall, motion sensor taps use 75% less water than manual taps, and only 8 liters (27%) of water from the manual tap sinks was actually used for hand scrubbing per 5 minute interval.

A total of 7060 cases were operated in the year of 2019 in our institute. On average 4 members scrubbed in per case, including the primary surgeon, assistants and scrub nurse. Cost of annual water consumption in Abu Dhabi, UAE is 10.41 AED per 1000 liter. Our analysis showed that the annual cost of water consumption for surgical scrubbing alone ranged from 1.8 to 7.5 million AED. This range suggests that use of motion sensor taps instead of manual taps could save up to 5.6 million AED (1.46 million USD) per year.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The surgical hand washing technique is associated with a considerable amount of water. Motion sensor taps have the advantage to decrease a great amount of water wastage with water flowing only during actual washing. Techniques to decrease that amount are available and can be considered to preserve the water.

Brat<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,Department Of Surgery,Boston, MA, USA <sup>2</sup>Harvard School Of Medicine,Department Of Biomedical Informatics,Brookline, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Since 2017, multiple states, insurance companies and pharmacies have placed blanket regulations on opioid prescribing. A seven-day limit on opioid prescriptions is the most common restriction across these institutions, however some have also placed 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day limits, restricting total opioid prescriptions to 350 MME. We sought to determine how patients undergoing surgery would be affected by these new restrictions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;3,000 patients were enrolled from 2016-2018 who were opioid na&iuml;ve and underwent surgery at one of four academic medical centers. These patients were called within a month of discharge and asked to report their post-discharge opioid consumption. 49&nbsp;distinct procedures were included in the analysis. The percentage of patients by procedure type whose post-discharge opioid consumption exceeded 350 MME was calculated.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;For 26 of 49&nbsp;procedures, no patients reported taking more than 350 MME. For the remaining 23&nbsp;procedures, 1.7-53% of patients required greater than 350 MME (Figure 1). Under this new policy, these patients may not be able to obtain a prescription of the appropriate size.&nbsp;Orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures were the most common types of surgeries where at least 10% of patients required greater than 350 MME.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The goal of post-operative pain management policies should be to optimize prescribing to individual needs, rather than simply to minimize all opioid prescribing. The increase in opioid misuse and mental health issues prompted by the current global pandemic makes personalized prescribing even more important. Current one-size-fits-all opioid prescribing policies could negatively impact 6.8% of patients undergoing surgery who require more than 350MME to appropriately control their pain after discharge. This represents 1.2 million postsurgical patients nationwide annually.

However, prescription utilization patterns largely remain to be elucidated. Our primary study objective was &nbsp;to utilize neuroscience-based nomenclature to assess a comprehensive list of psychotropic drugs, and to explore prescription patterns and predictors in bladder cancer patients.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A total of 10,516 patients diagnosed with clinical stage T1-T4a, N0, M0 bladder urothelial carcinoma from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare were analyzed. Prescription rates throughout 2-years post-diagnosis and patient adherence using MPR of 80% were captured. We used multivariable analysis to determine predictors associated with psychotropic prescription rates. Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) was used as an index to measure adherence in intervals of 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, and 2-years.&nbsp;Medication exposure was collected throughout 2-years from the time of bladder cancer diagnosis. Participants reported to take 1 or more psychotropic drugs were identified. The main outcome&nbsp;was an evaluation of psychotropic prescribing patterns and adherence across different drugs and demographic factors.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 10,516 patients, 5,621 (53%) were prescribed psychotropic drugs following cancer diagnosis. Overall, 3,972 (38%) patients had previous psychotropic prescriptions prior to cancer diagnosis, and these patients were much more likely to receive a post-cancer diagnosis prescription. Prescription rates for psychotropic medications were higher among patients with higher stage bladder cancer (P&nbsp;&lt; .001). GABA modulators/stimulators and serotonin reuptake inhibitors/stimulators were the highest prescribed psychotropic drugs in 21% of all patients. Adherence for all drugs was 32% at 3-months and continued to decrease over time.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Over half of bladder cancer patients received psychotropic prescriptions within two years of their cancer diagnosis. In the oncology setting, anxiolytics (e.g. benzodiazepines) and hypnotics were significantly less prescribed in bladder cancer patients. First-line antidepressants and anxiolytics prescription rates were found to be similar to the general population and raise concerns of under treatment in cancer patients. Given the chronicity of psychiatric disorders, significantly low adherence to medications warrants an emphasis on prolonged patient monitoring and further investigation for underlying reasons.

Nearly half of these complications occur post-discharge from the hospital where the responsibility of monitoring primarily falls on the patient and their caregivers. Effective communication between the clinical care team and patient is vital for early identification and management of post-discharge complications. Our objective was to identify and characterize major barriers to effective clinician-patient post-discharge communication after GI surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We conducted semi-structured interviews and focus groups that were audio-recorded and transcribed with GI surgery clinicians, including surgical oncologists and colorectal surgeons, registered nurses (RNs), and advanced practice providers (APPs). Clinicians were asked about their current post-discharge communication practices with patients and about barriers and facilitators impacting post-discharge symptom monitoring. Independent coding of two transcripts by four coders, with iterative reconciliation, was used to create a codebook, which was then used to code the remaining transcripts. Codes were then grouped into themes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Interviews/focus groups were completed with 12 clinicians. Four key themes about clinician-reported barriers to post-discharge communication (Table 1) emerged and revealed issues of (1) Patient health literacy: Patient inability to communicate clinically concerning symptoms, reflecting varying levels of clinical knowledge and ability to self-monitor; (2) Patient access to care team: Inefficient process for patients to contact the care team through the call center and/or the electronic health record, leading to communication delays; (3) Clinician time constraints: Lack of clinician time to proactively communicate with patients post-discharge to adequately monitor problems, leading to &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; identification and management of complications; and (4) Inconsistent composition of care team: Current staffing model frequently results in care team members who are unfamiliar with post-discharge GI surgery complications and care.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Both patient and clinician barriers contribute to ineffective post-discharge communication after GI surgery and may lead to inadequate or lack of early identification and management of complications. Addressing these barriers is essential when developing and implementing an effective post-discharge monitoring system for GI surgery patients. &nbsp;

Opioids remains one of the leading causes of injury related death in the United States. National data shows that nearly 80% of Americans search the Internet for health information. In this study, we evaluated the quality and comprehensiveness of information available on the internet for patients seeking information on opioids.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Commonly used search queries were generated from a systematic approach using a local survey, autocomplete and national trends data. The first five links were collected. Websites were each independently classified and evaluated by four surgical trainees. To control for unblinded review, scoring was based on a 51-point rubric on authorship (identifiable author, credentials listed, credibility), content (pharmacology, dosing/safety, indications, side effects, abuse potential, opioid use disorder (OUD), epidemiology, disposal, alternatives, references, reading level, last update) and website design (structure, font/background, graphics, layering, ad-free). Scores were weighted to account for sites categorized as more than one type and analyzed using descriptive statistics and 2-sided test of significance with analysis of variance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Thirty-seven search queries were generated, identifying 106 websites that met search criteria. Websites were categorized into the following for comparisons: 28.4% Government (GOV), 18.2% commercial, 18.5% academic/physician, 10.3% non-profit, 8.8% news/media, 15.8% not otherwise classified (NOC). GOV and academic/physician sites achieved the highest total scores with mean scores of 17.13, (SD 6.67) and 12.8, (SD 6.48) respectively, while NOC and commercial achieved the lowest total scores with respective mean scores of 6.59 (SD 4.61) and 7.21 (SD 4.13), p &lt; 0.001 for comparison across group means. There was a difference between all groups regarding the quality of information on abuse potential (p=0.019), alternatives (p=0.012), disposal (p=0.007), epidemiology (p=0.036), OUD (p=0.006) and pharmacology (p &lt;0.001) but not indications (p=0.208) or dosing (p=0.248). Content scores related to abuse potential, pharmacology and OUD were higher in academic/physician and GOV sites. The lowest content scores overall were on information related to alternatives (mean=0.26, SD 0.70) and disposal (0.26, SD 0.78).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The quality and scope of public information on the internet regarding opioids is limited, particularly on non-opioid alternatives and safe disposal. GOV and academic/physician websites achieved the highest quality scores, yet account for only a third of the sites encountered from a systematic search approach. Given the low proportion of websites with adequate quality of information, physicians should help direct patients to appropriates websites for information on opioid use.

ACP consists of creating advance directives (ADs), identifying surrogate decision makers (SDMs), and documenting goals of care. We identified factors associated with the completion of preoperative ACP to identify opportunities to optimize ACP for older surgical patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This was a retrospective study of surgical patients &ge;70 years old who underwent elective colectomy, proctectomy, hepatectomy, esophagectomy, or pancreatectomy between 01/2015-08/2019. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from our institution&rsquo;s 100% capture ACS NSQIP database. ACP metrics were extracted from the electronic medical record. We investigated possible predictors of ACP including age, sex, race, need for English interpreter, and ASA class. Using factors with a p&lt;0.20 on univariable analysis, we created 2 multivariable Poisson models to determine factors associated with ACP metrics (available AD and identified SDM). Goals of care documentation was not analyzed in multivariable fashion, as no factors were significantly associated with this metric. We also analyzed whether ACP was more frequent for patients who experienced postoperative complications or death.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;267 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 75.3 years and 149 (56%) were male. 156 (58%) patients underwent colorectal resection, 78 (29%) pancreatectomy, 25 (9%) hepatectomy, and 8 (3%) esophagectomy. Most patients (187, 70%) had an AD, although this was only available on the day of surgery for 97 (36%) patients. 57 (21%) patients had a SDM identified and 31 (12%) had a documented goals of care conversation. On multivariable analysis, older age and white race were associated with an increased likelihood of having an AD available on the day of surgery (Table 1). Women were 1.7 times more likely to have a SDM on multivariable analysis (p=0.02). No factors were significantly associated with goals of care documentation on univariate analysis. ACP was not performed more frequently in patients who experienced postoperative complications or death (available AD, p=0.94; SDM identified, p=0.37; and documented goals of care, p=0.44). Of the 5 patients who died following surgery, none had documented goals of care preoperatively and only 1 had an AD available at the time of surgery.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: ACP was not routinely documented for older patients undergoing major surgery. ACP was not more frequent in patients who experienced complications or death, demonstrating the importance of universal preoperative ACP in older patients. We plan to identify barriers to ACP at our institution and implement interventions to improve access to ACP for older adults undergoing surgery.

Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are the most common hospital acquired infections in the United States. External urinary collection devices (EUCDs) may serve as an alternative to indwelling urethral catheters (IUCs), thereby decreasing the rate of CAUTIs. PureWick&reg; is a novel female EUCD, with early case reports suggesting safe and efficacious use. However, no study has demonstrated the PureWick&reg; to reduce the incidence of CAUTIs. Therefore, we sought to compare the CAUTI rate and median indwelling catheter days before and after availability of PureWick&reg; at a single academic institution.&nbsp; We also performed a descriptive analysis of female surgical patients receiving an EUCD.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective review of adult female patients admitted to our institution on a surgical service, including intensive care unit and floor patients, who received an IUC and/or an EUCD. Patients admitted in the 3 months before (PRE) and 12 months after (POST) PureWick&reg; availability were included. The longer POST period was to allow sufficient time and usage of EUCD to occur. Two groups were compared: PRE patients who received an IUC vs. POST patients who received an IUC and/or EUCD.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Out of 906 patients, 127 received an EUCD in the POST cohort and overall, 879 received an IUC (433 (99.5%) PRE vs. 446 (94.7%) POST). There were no differences in the PRE and POST cohorts regarding age and comorbidities except end stage renal disease (3.7% PRE vs. 6.8% POST, p=0.036). The number of IUC days were similar between the PRE and POST cohorts (median, 2 vs. 2 days, p=0.188). Compared to the PRE cohort, the POST cohort had a higher rate of CAUTI (infections per 1,000 catheter days, 11.2 vs. 4.6, p=0.017) and overall UTI (infections per 1,000 catheter days, 5.4 vs. 4.8, p=0.036). In the POST cohort, the rate of UTI associated with EUCD use was 4.6 infections per 1,000 device days. Most patients (80.3%) who received an EUCD also received an IUC. Measurement of strict ins and outs (59.1%) was the most common indication for EUCD use. Trauma surgery (44.1%) and neurosurgery (18.9%) were the services that most frequently ordered an EUCD.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While EUCDs might appear to be a promising alternative to IUCs for female patients, this single center pre/post analysis found the CAUTI rate increased after introduction of an EUCD. This may be related to selection bias, with EUCDs being ordered for patients who would not have otherwise received an IUC. Nonetheless, adoption of EUCDs did not change the median number of indwelling catheter days. Further research is needed to clarify if female EUCDs can be effective in decreasing IUC days and/or CAUTI rates prior to any widespread adoption. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who underwent a surgical procedure at our institution from 10/1/2018-10/1/2020 were enrolled in a text message-based survey study to quantify opioids consumed after discharge and to measure overall satisfaction with pain control. Text messages were automatically sent to patients after discharge.&nbsp;4,923 patients were included in the analysis. Patient information was abstracted from the medical record via automated extraction and manual chart review. Factors including patient age, gender, race, type of surgery, and amount of opioids prescribed were analyzed amongst survey responders and non-responders.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 1,094 responders (22% response rate). Survey responders were older (mean age 57 y vs. 56 y). Patients who were white (26% response rate) and underwent orthopedic surgery (28% response rate) were more likely to respond compared to other races and types of surgery, respectively. Responders were more likely to have undergone inpatient surgery than outpatient (24% vs. 20%). There was no difference amongst responders and non-responders in the amount of MMEs prescribed upon discharge, gender, or time of year.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: After testing text-message based opioid consumption surveys, we conclude that this system of automated data collection has comparable limitations from bias between responders and non-responders when compared with phone call surveys. Since our text messaging system obtains post-discharge opioid consumption data in an automated fashion and requires minimal manual effort, text messaging could be used to track larger patient populations in future studies. Future efforts may focus on improving patient engagement to increase the current response rate.

Multiple studies, including the Institutes of Medicine 2003 report, have shown that racial and ethnic minorities experience lower quality of care (are less likely to receive routine care and experience higher rates of morbidity/mortality when care is provided) than their white counterparts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further research suggests that implicit (unconscious) bias amongst healthcare professionals contributes to health disparities. We sought to evaluate the effects of community engagement on implicit bias in healthcare providers, and gauge the feasibility of conducting this research in a healthcare setting.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Subjects were identified based on their participation in a community youth trauma outreach program, and included medical students, general surgery residents, and hospital staff. All subjects were directed to an anonymous web survey at Harvard University&rsquo;s Project Implicit web server (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit). De-identified data was self-submitted to a protected REDCap database. Data collection period was immediately three weeks following the community engagement program (Aug 21, 2019-Sept 20, 2019).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 12 subjects completed the implicit bias surveys, and all reported a history of volunteering &ldquo;sometimes&rdquo; (75%) or &ldquo;often&rdquo; (25%). Average implicit bias scores demonstrated little-to-no preference for black people over white people, and little-to-no preference for other people over Arab/Muslims. Overall, volunteers rated their comfort in different social situations as &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no differences in implicit bias or comfort scores based on volunteer frequency (all p&gt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
&nbsp;

Our data showed that implicit bias screening in healthcare workers is feasible, and that bias in our volunteer cohort was overall low.&nbsp;&nbsp;While not the purpose of this study, interestingly a significance difference within groups was discovered, showing increased implicit bias towards Arab-Muslims as compared to African Americans. This may suggest the increased need for targeted community engagement within the Arab-Muslim population. However, our study is limited by&nbsp;small sample size and selection bias in our cohort of volunteer respondents.&nbsp;

Further study is needed to determine the effects of community engagement on implicit bias in healthcare providers.

Najafi<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Surgery,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Despite the high life-long risk of dementia in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD), early identification of the onset of dementia remained challenging. Recent studies suggest that a dual decline in motor and cognition, known as motoric-cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, is a strong predictor of early dementia onset. However, current tools to detect MCR are resource-intensive, educationally, and culturally biased, and often impractical for busy clinics and home settings. To address the gap, we designed an instrumented trail-making task (iTMT) based on a wearable sensor (worn on the shin) with interactive game-based software installed on a tablet. The iTMT test includes reaching to 5 indexed circles, a combination of numbers (1-to-3) and letters (A&amp;B) randomly positioned inside target circles, in a sequential order, which virtually appears on a tablet-screen, by rotating one&rsquo;s ankle-joint while standing and holding a chair for safety. By measuring time to complete iTMT task (iTMT time), iTMT enables quantifying cognitive-motor performance. The present study&#39;s objective is to examine the feasibility of iTMT to detect early cognitive-motor decline in PDs.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Four groups of volunteers, including 12 healthy-young adults, 15 PDs, and14 cognitively-intact older adults (CI-older), were recruited. Participants completed three trials of iTMT, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), single- and dual-task walking tests.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;All participants enabled to complete iTMT with less than 3 minutes, indicating high feasibility. The average iTMT time for healthy-young, CI-Older, PD, and MCI participants were 18.5&plusmn;0.6s, 20.1&plusmn;0.9s, 34.3&plusmn;3.0s, and 49.2&plusmn;6.2 s, respectively. The pairwise comparison suggested large effect sizes for iTMT between PD vs healthy-young &nbsp;(Cohen&rsquo;s d=1.91, p=0.028) and CI-older (d=1.67, p=0.049), and between MCI vs PD (d=0.81, p=0.031), healthy-young &nbsp;(d=1.85, p&lt;0.01), and CI-Older (d=1.74, p&lt;0.01) as shown in the figure below. Significant correlations were observed when comparing iTMT time with MoCA (r=-0.31, p=0.026), ST gait speed (r=-0.51, p&lt;0.001), and DT gait speed (r=-0.44, p&lt;0.01).
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This study demonstrated the feasibility and early results supporting the potential application of iTMT to determine cognitive-motor and distinguishing MCI cases. Future studies are warranted to test the ability of iTMT to detect MCR syndrome and track its subtle changes over time.

Chen<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Operating room (OR) productivity is one of the most important determinants of economic success for most healthcare centers with surgical facilities. Various factors contribute to the turnover in the OR, which in turn affects the efficiency of the system. One of the factors that adversely impact OR productivity is surgical case cancellations. These canceled cases not only prolong turnover which incurs a significant financial loss but also affects patients psychologically and often, financially. This study was undertaken to explore common etiologies of case cancellations at a tertiary care center and identify potential areas of intervention.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Data for all surgical cases canceled during the period of October 2018 to September 2019 in a tertiary care center were collected and retrospectively analyzed using STATA software v.16. Student&rsquo;s t-test and 2 statistics were used, with p &lt; 0.05 significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Cancellations accounted for 6 % of the total scheduled cases. 64% of the case cancellations were attributed to surgeon related factors such as surgeon&rsquo;s request or surgeon not certified. Surgeon&rsquo;s gender or years in practice did not correlate with the surgeon&rsquo;s requests for these cancellations. Additionally, certain sub-specialties had a higher rate of cancellations such as orthopedics (33%) and cardiothoracic (12%). Other reasons included patient-related factors, such as no show and medical optimization, which were responsible for 18% cancellations, whereas administrative and scheduling issues resulted in 16% of the cancellations.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

We found that surgical case cancellations are, in general, infrequent at a tertiary care center. Surgeon requests account for the majority of the cancellations, which did not correlate with specific factors such as gender or years in practice. Lastly, the cancellation rate has a skewed distribution amongst different sub-specialties, with most cancellations observed for orthopedics surgery.

Ratnasekera<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Crozer-Keystone Medical Center,Upland, PA, USA <sup>2</sup>Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine,Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Neurogenic Pulmonary Edema (NPE) is a rare syndrome characterized by acute pulmonary edema following a central nervous system (CNS) injury with the absence of a primary cardiogenic or pulmonary insult. There are multiple causes, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), seizures, and cerebral hemorrhage, however, the frequency, risk factors, morbidity and mortality of the disease remains widely unknown. First, we present a case report of NPE in a 22-year-old African-American male with a single gunshot wound to the head. Second, we perform a systematic review of NPE related to TBI in order to examine risk factors associated with mortality.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

PRISMA guidelines were used to conduct the study (figure 1). 1,399 articles specific to NPE were identified by searching Pubmed and Scopus. 128 records remained after applying exclusion criteria and 29 studies were included in quantitative analysis, identifying 45 patients total. Acquired patient data included admission vital signs, demographics, and mortality. Frequency data, t tests, and odds ratios were generated using IBM SPSS Version 26 to examine risk factors for mortality. Non-numerical data, such as common radiographic imaging findings, physical exam findings, pharmacologic treatments used, and ventilation strategies were also reviewed for discussion.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Overall mortality from NPE in traumatic brain injury was found to be 44.20%. Of the patients who survived, 63.6% (n=14) made a full recovery from NPE and 78.3% were discharged home. Median hospital stay was 11 days. Admission vitals, such as systolic blood pressure (mean [SD], 113.13 [20.17]) (P = .088) and heart rate (97.93 [19.89]) (P = .057) were not significant in predicting mortality. While the majority of patients were male (83.7%, n = 36), there was no associated significant risk in mortality based on sex; male (OR, 1.050; 95% CI, 0.248 &ndash; 7.913) female (OR, 0.750; 95% CI, 0.171 &ndash; 3.291). Median age was 19 years, however, age was not a significant risk factor for mortality (22.92 [12.61]) (P = .385).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

NPE is a syndrome defined by acute interstitial and alveolar edema following a CNS injury without a primary cardiogenic or pulmonary insult. NPE caused by TBI is rare and carries a significant mortality and morbidity. To our knowledge this is the first systematic review of NPE associated with TBI. While the generated data may provide an idea of a typical presentation of NPE, there is insufficient evidence to establish risk factors associated with mortality.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a retrospective review of all patients at our level 1 trauma center from 2016-2019 who sustained a severe TBI (defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score [GCS] &le; 8 with radiographic evidence of brain injury). We excluded penetrating injuries, patients who expired, and those not receiving amantadine.&nbsp;&nbsp;We collected data on demographics, admission neurologic status (GCS<sub>1</sub>), injury severity score (ISS), amantadine prescribing details, dual neurostimulant use (amantadine + methylphenidate), and discharge neurologic status (GCS<sub>2</sub>).&nbsp;Neurorecovery was defined as: (GCS<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;GCS<sub>1</sub>) / (GCS<sub>2</sub>). The resulting quotients were categorized as minimal recovery (&le; 0.4), moderate recovery (0.4 to &lt; 0.7), and good recovery (&ge; 0.7).&nbsp;Patients were grouped according to these three ratios, and data was compared between groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using SVMs, significantly different variables (p&lt;.05) and potential confounders (p &le;.1) were used to predict&nbsp;good&nbsp;neurorecovery.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;There were 76 patients; 19.7% (n=15) had mild recovery, 29% (n=22) had moderate, and 51.3% (n=39) had good recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no difference between groups regarding age (p=0.9), sex (p=0.1), race (p=0.4), neurosurgical decompression (p=0.2), time until amantadine administration (p=0.4), duration or dose of amantadine therapy (both p=0.6), or ISS (p=0.1).&nbsp;&nbsp;However, GCS<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;varied significantly (p&lt;.0001) between groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our SVM model predicting neurorecovery had a low misclassification rate (14%) and high accuracy (AUC 0.95).&nbsp;&nbsp;When the predicted probability of&nbsp;good&nbsp;neurorecovery for each patient was analyzed with our SVM model variables, only dual neurostimulant therapy and GCS<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;were significantly associated.&nbsp;Specifically, predicted probabilities were higher with combination therapy (56.6% vs 34.8%, p=0.01) and a lower GCS<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;(75.8% [GCS 3] vs 5% [GCS 8], p&lt;.0001).

We hypothesized there is no difference in clinical outcomes between patients who received a contrast study compared to those who did not. To that end, our study aimed to evaluate the need for routine contrast study following traumatic gastric repair.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This is a retrospective review of all trauma patients admitted to an urban level 1 trauma center and sustained gastric injuries with subsequent repair between 2016-2018. Demographics, surgical interventions, complications, and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Statistical analysis included mean (&plusmn; standard deviation), Chi square/Fisher Exact and multivariate logistic regression methods with a 5% significance level.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 96 patients received a gastric repair, of whom 17 (17.7%) had a contrast study performed. Overall, mean age was 34 &plusmn; 14 years; 89% male; 77% African American; 95% penetrating injury. Mean injury severity score was 23 &plusmn; 12. The most common gastric repair was primary suture repair (76%) followed by stapled resection (17%). Mean length of stay was 23 &plusmn; 25 days. Mortality within 30 days was 4%. Out of 17 patients with a contrast study, none were found to have a gastric leak. &nbsp;Mean time to contrast study was 5.6 &plusmn; 1.4 days.&nbsp; There was no statistically significant difference in post-operative complications between groups (41% vs. 37%; p = 0.73). Specifically, there was no statistically significant difference in post-operative bleeding (18% vs. 4%; p = 0.10) and intraabdominal infection (12% vs. 24%; p = 0.17).&nbsp; Multivariate logistic regression analysis supported our hypothesis and demonstrated a lack of statistical significance in the likelihood of having a contrast study performed when comparing those with and with without multiple injuries (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.4-4.9; p = 0.54), primary suture repair versus other types of repair (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 0.6-6.8; p = 0.31), and length of operation of&nbsp; &gt; vs &le; 200 minutes (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 0.5-5.0; p = 0.41).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Gastric leak after repair is rare and there is no statistically significant difference in clinical outcomes when comparing patients who underwent contrast study to those who did not. Routine contrast study after traumatic gastric repair is not necessary and the selective use of a contrast study is recommended.

Many trauma centers initiate full trauma team activation (FTTA) for these high-risk patients. We sought to&nbsp;determine if FTTA was necessary in these patients compared with those who were evaluated as a trauma consultation (CON).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We identified patients aged &ge;55 on preinjury AC who presented to our Level I trauma center from January 2015 to December 2019 with blunt isolated head injury (non-head AIS &le;2) and confirmed ICH. CON patients and FTTA patients were matched by age and head AIS. Demographic and clinical factors, time to evaluation, length of stay, and clinical course were compared. Cox proportional hazards model evaluated risk factors for mortality or adverse discharge disposition.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 45 CON patients and 45 FTTA patients. Mean age was 80 years in both groups. Fall was the most common injury mechanism (98% CON vs. 91.6% FTTA). Although admission GCS was lower in FTTA (14 vs. 15, p&lt;0.01), there were no di!erence between groups in ISS or head AIS. CON had a longer time from arrival to CT scan (1.3 vs. 0.4 hrs, p&lt;0.01). Hospital days were similar (CON: 3.9 vs. TTA: 3.7 days). However, CON had increased ventilator use (p=0.03). Lower admission GCS was the only factor associated with increased risk of death, while CON status, AC type, time to CT scan, head AIS, AC reversal, and age were not related to mortality. Among survivors, only head AIS increased the risk of discharge to a level of care higher than that preinjury (p=0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: FTTA patients had a significantly shorter time to head CT than CON patients, but there was no diference in mortality or adverse discharge disposition. Any alteration in GCS was strongly associated with mortality and should prompt evaluation by FTTA.

Operative forearm fractures (FFs) may require antibiotics, but the optimal duration and timing of antibiotic regimens remains unclear. This study sought to compare the rates of post-operative surgical site infection (SSI) between patients receiving only pre-operative antibiotics and those receiving pre-operative and post-operative antibiotics. We hypothesized similar rates of SSI between the two groups.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single-center retrospective review of adult trauma patients (2014-2018) with FFs was performed. The primary outcome was SSI. Patients who underwent operative repair of FFs were compared by antibiotic regimen: patients receiving pre-operative antibiotics only (PRE) vs. patients receiving pre-operative and post-operative antibiotics (PRE-POST). Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables respectively. A univariate analysis was performed for risk of infection in both open and closed FFs.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
From 683 patients with FFs, 233 (34.1%) underwent an operation. Of which, 63 (27%) received PRE and 33 (14%) PRE-POST.&nbsp;When comparing PRE to PRE-POST, there was no difference in demographic variables including age, sex, comorbidities, or injury severity score (all p&gt;0.05). The most common procedure in both groups was open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) (56 in PRE group (88.9%) and 24 in PRE-POST group (72.7%)). Patients in the PRE group had a shorter median antibiotic duration (2 days vs. 6 days, p &lt; 0.0001). No difference was observed in SSI (0% vs. 3%), median time to repair (19 vs. 22 hours), or mortality (1.6% vs 0%) (all p&gt;0.05) (Table 1). When compared to patients with closed fractures, patients with open fractures had similar risk of SSI (OR 0.19,&nbsp;0.01-3.08, p=0.24). Patients in the PRE-POST group more frequently returned to the operating room (OR) (0% vs 6.1%, p = 0.05) and return to emergency department (ED) (7.9% vs. 27.3%, p=0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study demonstrated similarly low rates of SSI between FF patients receiving pre-operative antibiotic therapy compared to patients receiving additional post-operative antibiotics. Interestingly, patients receiving post-operative antibiotics were found to have significantly greater rates of return the OR and ED, although this may be related to selection bias. This study supports the discontinuation of antibiotics post-operatively for traumatic FFs. However, future multicenter prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

In the past decade, there has been a lack of systematic review on significant iatrogenic injuries caused by mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in comparison to manual CPR.&nbsp;The purpose of this systematic literature review is to describe, review, and compare the significant life-threatening iatrogenic injuries caused by mechanical CPR&nbsp;versus&nbsp;manual CPR via a meta-analysis of studies.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A systematic review of PubMed and Embase was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

A total of 1,814 patients were enrolled in 7 studies were included in our meta-analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
It was found that significant life-threatening iatrogenic injuries had a higher odds ratio when mechanical CPR was used rather than manual CPR. Chest wall fractures had the highest prevalence rate (55.7%), followed by lung injuries (3.7%), and then liver (1.0%) and diaphragm (0.2%) lacerations.&nbsp;Manual CPR in-hospital patients had a higher odds ratio for risk of mortality.

Here, we aim to further establish the AHQ as a useful clinical tool for surgeons, by demonstrating its inter-test reliability, low patient burden and ability to capture long term changes in quality of life (QoL) after VHR.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  For the patient burden and test-retest portion of the study, VHR patients were prospectively identified and manually timed completing the AHQ. A subset of these patients, were then re-sent the AHQ, and asked to complete it again, to measure its reliability in a rest-test methodology. Demographics were abstracted from the medical record, and Kruskal Wallis tests were used to assess differences in patient burden based on demographics. Another set of patients who underwent VHR, were tested both pre- and post-operatively using the AHQ, HerQles and Short-Form 12 (SF-12), up to over 13.5 months after surgery. QoL scores from the different surveys were correlated and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to determine changes in QoL after VHR.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A 419 AHQ surveys (209 pre-operative and 210 post-operative) were assessed for patient burden. The AHQ demonstrated low patient burden, with median time to completion of 1.1 and 2.7 minutes, for the pre-operative and the longer post-operative instrument, respectively. The elderly (&gt;65 years) took significantly longer to complete both the pre- and post-operative instruments (p =0.04, 0.002), but there were no differences in patient burden based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. For the post-operative instrument, the use of an iPad significantly reduced patient burden, when compared to a paper survey (2.5 vs 3.0 minutes, p= 0.005). In test-retesting, the AHQ showed high reliability, with significant correlations for all questions, and excellent reliability coefficients for both pre-operative and post-operative instruments (r= 0.91, 0.89). 106 patients were included in the longitudinal portion of the study. Median AHQ QoL scores significantly improved one-month after VHR (pre 52 vs. post 83, p&lt;0.001), and were not significantly changed twelve months after surgery (92, p=0.86). The AHQ was significantly correlated with 6/7 (86%) times points of HerQles and SF-12 PS and 5/7 (71%) SF12-MS time points, ranging from pre-operative to over 13.5 months after VHR (Figure 1).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The AHQ is a valuable clinical tool for any surgeon treating patients with VH. We have shown that it has low patient burden, excellent inter-test reliability, and can effectively capture hernia related QoL information over a year after VHR.

Prior studies have demonstrated reduction in complications and healthcare costs. However, the impact of prehabilitation on patient-reported outcomes is unknown, and patient experiences may not align with clinical measures of value. We evaluated the association of participation in a structured prehabilitation program with patient-reported outcomes after surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We conducted a retrospective study of patients who participated in prehabilitation and underwent abdominal surgery, thoracic surgery, or hysterectomy between 2014 and 2019 at a tertiary medical center. The prehabilitation program engaged patients in four daily exercises prior to surgery: physical activity, pulmonary rehabilitation, nutritional optimization, and stress reduction. We used propensity score weighting to control for confounders, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, operation, Charlson comorbidity score, marital status, education, and occupation. Average treatment effect (ATE) was then calculated for composite patient-reported outcome scores collected one month postoperatively in the following areas: physical function, life satisfaction, pain, anxiety, and depression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 116 patients who participated in prehabilitation and 528 propensity-weighted control patients were included in the analysis. Mean (SD) age was 52 (14) years and 607 (78%) patients were female. Both groups reported low levels of pain, depression, and anxiety, and high satisfaction (Table 1). After propensity weighting, compared to controls, prehabilitation patients had no significant difference in patient-reported outcomes measuring physical function (ATE=-0.253, P=0.559), life satisfaction (ATE=-0.232, P=0.305), Michigan Body Map Score (ATE= -0.092, P=0.701), pain severity (ATE=0.108, P=0.658), anxiety (ATE=0.184, P=0.525), or depression (ATE=0.169, P=0.487) at one month after surgery.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Prehabilitation did not result in significant differences in aspects of patient-reported postoperative quality of life. Though prehabilitation may improve objective outcomes, opportunities exist to design surgical prehabilitation programs that will optimize patient-reported outcomes that are critical to recovery. Future studies could explore the modification of prehabilitation programs to improve patient-reported outcomes, which may compound the benefits of these programs for patients.

To date, however, there has been no comparison of patient-reported outcomes between novel opioid-sparing recovery pathways and standard of care.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We compared prospectively collected data from patients participating in an opioid-sparing postoperative pathway with patients who received standard of care from 2018-2019. Surgical procedures included laparoscopic cholecystectomy, inguinal and umbilical hernia repair, and thyroidectomy/parathyroidectomy. Patients who participated in the opioid-sparing pathway at a single institution received preoperative counseling to use non-opioid analgesics as their primary method of pain control and were provided with a small &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; prescription of no more than 10 opioid pills for breakthrough pain. Patients who received standard of care were sampled from a collaborative of 73 hospitals in Michigan. Patients were contacted between postoperative days 30-90 to complete follow-up surveys. Outcomes included number of opioid pills prescribed, number of opioid pills taken, pain score in the 7 days after surgery (0=no pain, 1=minimal pain, 2=moderate pain, 3=severe pain), satisfaction (scale 0=extremely dissatisfied, 10=extremely satisfied), regret (scale 1=absolutely regret surgery, 5=absolutely no regret), and quality of life (scale 1=terrible quality of life, 5=excellent quality of life).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;During the study period, 321 patients participated in an opioid-sparing pathway and 2474 patients received standard of care and responded to a postoperative follow-up survey. Mean (SD) age was 55 (15) years old and 51% of patients were female. Patients in the opioid-sparing pathway received smaller prescriptions, used fewer pills, and reported similar pain scores compared to patients who received standard of care (Table 1). There were no significant differences in satisfaction, regret, or quality of life scores between the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Compared to patients receiving standard of care, patients who participated in an opioid-sparing recovery pathway received and used fewer opioids but reported similar satisfaction and pain control. Expanding this strategy to other surgical procedures may be an effective way to reduce opioid-related morbidity after surgery without compromising the patient experience.

The optimal workup and management of a patient with suspected common bile duct stones remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes between patients undergoing magnetic resonance&nbsp;cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and cholecystectomy (CCY)&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a post-hoc analysis of a multicenter, prospective study of patients with suspected common bile duct stones from 2016-2019. Patients were grouped according to initial study/treatment (MRCP vs ERCP vs CCY&plusmn;IOC). Pairwise propensity score matching was performed to control for probability of retained common bile duct (CBD) stones. Clinical factors, management strategies, and outcomes, which included a composite endpoint (30-day readmission, any Clavien-Dindo complication, and mortality), were compared between matched groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 989 subjects included for analysis, 308 (31%) underwent MRCP, 261 (27%) underwent ERCP, and 420 (42%) were taken for CCY without further pre-operative assessment. IOC was performed in 253 (60%) of CCY subjects. Total bilirubin (mg/dl) was significantly higher in ERCP (2.8 [1.7-4.6]) compared to MRCP (2.2 [1.2-3.6]) or CCY subjects (1.3 [0.7-2.4], p&lt;0.001). CBD diameter (cm) was similar between ERCP (0.9&plusmn;0.2) and MRCP (0.9&plusmn;0.3) but was significantly lower in those proceeding directly to CCY (0.8&plusmn;0.3, p&lt;.001).&nbsp;Propensity scores were generated and 1:1 matching was performed to create three pairwise matched cohorts: MRCP vs ERCP (n=430), MRCP vs CCY (n=528), and ERCP vs CCY (n=430). The presence of CBD stones was significantly higher in ERCP compared to MRCP (83% vs 42%, p&lt;0.001) or CCY subjects (83% vs 29%, p&lt;.001). Post-operative ERCP was performed more frequently in CCY compared to MRCP (22% vs 6%, p&lt;.001) or ERCP subjects (23% vs 2%, p&lt;.001). The rate of retained CBD stones, as determined by the presence of stones on post-operative ERCP, was higher for CCY compared to MRCP (18% vs 6%, p&lt;0.001) or ERCP subjects (20% vs 2%, p&lt;.001), and in MRCP compared to ERCP subjects (6% vs 2%, p=.04). The incidence of the composite endpoint was significantly higher in CCY compared to both MRCP (37% vs 26%, p=.01) and ERCP subjects (38% vs 17%, p&lt;.001); there was no significant difference in this composite endpoint between MRCP and ERCP (25% vs 17%, p=.08).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In modern clinical practice in the United States, proceeding directly to cholecystectomy &plusmn; intraoperative cholangiogram in patients with suspected common bile duct stones is common. However, the incidence of retained CBD stones is 20% and post-operative ERCP is commonly required. Compared to ERCP and MRCP, CCY&nbsp;(IOC) is least successful at detecting and clearing CBD stones and is associated with overall worse outcomes at 30 days.

Feather<sup>1</sup>, J. Turcotte<sup>1</sup>, J. Klune<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Anne Arundel Medical Center,Department Of Surgery,Annapolis, MD, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) is a surgical emergency that necessitates swift operative resolution. &nbsp;Repair can be performed either laparoscopically or open, though laparoscopic repair has historically accounted for a small number. We use the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database to compare perioperative and 30-day postoperative (30POP) outcomes of open and laparoscopic repair of PPUs.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The 2016-2018 ACS-NSQIP database was used to create the patient cohort, using ICD-10 and procedure (CPT) codes. An unmatched analysis was performed to identify factors that likely contributed to the laparoscopic vs open treatment allocation. Propensity score matching (PSM) was then used to reduce confounding and identify outcomes that were not explained by the underlying differences in the patient cohorts.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 3375 patients were included in the study: 3135 patients in the open group (OG) and 340 (~10%) in the laparoscopic group (LG). The use of laparoscopy remained the same at 10%, 9.7% and 9.7% of repairs during 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively. In this complete study cohort, septic shock was present in 10.5% of patients in OG, and 4.4% in LG (p&lt;0.001). Patients in OG were older, more likely to be male, be functionally dependent, have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ascites, hypertension, acute renal failure (ARF), and weight loss (p &lt; 0.05 for all). Patients in OG were also more likely to be American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 4 or 5 (31% vs 18%, p &lt; 0.001). There was no difference in ulcer location (gastric vs duodenal) between groups.

After PSM to control for comorbidities and illness severity that differed between groups on univariate analysis, 288 patients remained in each group; no significant differences in comorbidity burden or illness severity remained after matching. ASA, which was held out of the PSM to assess cohort balance, was also equivalent after matching.

Analysis of the matched cohorts revealed that there is no statistically significant difference in in-hospital mortality when comparing OG (5.9%) and LG (3.8%) repairs of PPUs (p=0.245). The LG was associated with significantly longer operative times (92 vs 79 min, p = 0.003), shorter lengths of stay (8.2 vs 9.4 days, p = 0.044) and a higher probability of being discharged home (81% vs 73%, p = 0.017). Outcomes in the 30POP were largely equivalent, except that OG still carried a higher risk for bleeding (14.6% vs 8%, p = 0.012) and pneumonia (8.7% vs 4.5%, p = 0.044).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While laparoscopic repairs take longer, they lead to shorter hospital stays and higher likelihood of discharge home. There is no difference in in-hospital mortality between open and laparoscopic repair. However, there has not been an increased adoption of this technique over time.&nbsp; Further study to identify patients that are candidates for this technique is warranted. &nbsp;

Powell<sup>1</sup>, J. W. Meredith<sup>1</sup>, R. W. Randle<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Wake Forest University School Of Medicine,Department Of General Surgery,Winston-Salem, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Cholecystectomy is a core procedure for general surgeons, but it is unclear if graduating residents can manage patients with gallbladder disease to achieve outcomes equivalent to those of faculty surgeons. The Chairman&rsquo;s service is designed to provide chief residents with an attending supervised opportunity to maximize responsibility and continuity and feel the pressure that responsible surgeons experience. They evaluate patients in their own clinic, determine surgical candidacy, schedule operations, and direct post-operative care. In the operating room, supervised chiefs perform the operation using their preferred approach and techniques rather than adapt the approach to satisfy the attending&rsquo;s preferences. We compared outcomes and complications of cholecystectomy performed on the Chairman&rsquo;s service to those performed on standard services where faculty direct most decision making.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We matched adults undergoing cholecystectomy from July, 2016 through June, 2019 on the Chairman&rsquo;s service 1:2 to standard service patients based on indication (primary ICD-10) and age (within 10 years). We compared patients, operative details, outcomes, and complications.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The study included 186 cholecystectomies; the primary indication was most often cholelithiasis (90.3%). Chairman&rsquo;s service patients were slightly younger (42.2 years vs 48.8, p&lt;0.01) and healthier (mean Charlson Comorbidity Index 0.9 vs 1.4, p=0.16) than standard service patients. Operative approach was similar (open 4.8% vs 2.4%, laparoscopic 95.2% vs 94.4%, and conversions 0.0% vs 3.2%, p=0.14) between the Chairman&rsquo;s and standard services, respectively. Residents on the Chairman&rsquo;s service were more likely to perform a cholangiogram (48.4% vs 22.6%, p&lt;0.01) and have longer operative times during laparoscopic cholecystectomy both with cholangiogram (146&plusmn;28 min vs 85&plusmn;22, p&lt;0.01) and without (94&plusmn;31 min vs 76&plusmn;35, p&lt;0.01) compared to the standard service. Post-op complication rates were similar (5.2% Chairman&rsquo;s vs 5.0% standard, p=0.95) which included surgical site infection, hematoma, hernia, retained stones and intraoperative injury. No patients suffered bile leak, bile duct injury, or reoperation. Despite a higher proportion of same-day discharges on the Chairman&rsquo;s service (90.3% vs 70.2%, p&lt;0.01), post-op ED visits were similar (12.1% Chairman&rsquo;s vs 7.4% standard, p=0.32), and readmissions were less frequent (0.0% Chairman&rsquo;s vs 5% standard, p=0.03).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
With appropriate supervision, chief residents provide safe care for patients undergoing cholecystectomy even when they are directing medical decisions and practicing according to their preferences. Longer operative times and a higher proportion of cholangiograms performed on the Chairman&rsquo;s service may indicate a more cautious intraoperative approach appropriate for younger surgeons, but Chairman&rsquo;s service patients were no more likely to experience complications or be readmitted than those on standard services.

To combat this, surgeons around the&nbsp;US are now discharging patients with much smaller prescriptions and instructions to use non-opioid alternatives. However, it is unclear whether there is any difference in patient-reported outcomes between simply recommending non-opioid analgesic medications and prescribing them.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients undergoing 6 common surgical procedures at our institution participated in an opioid-sparing pain management pathway between February 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019. Patients were given in-depth preoperative counseling regarding safe use and risks of opioids, advised to use non-opioid medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen for primary pain control, and provided with a small rescue prescription of oxycodone 5 mg for breakthrough pain.&nbsp;While all patients were advised to use non-opioids, due to variation in practice,&nbsp;some patients actually received prescriptions for one or both of these medications in their discharge paperwork. Patient-reported outcomes and opioid use were surveyed postoperatively. Satisfaction was measured on a scale of 0-10 and pain was reported on a scale of 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). Student&rsquo;s t-test and Chi-squared analyses were used to compare patient-reported outcomes in patients who received a non-opioid analgesic prescription and those who did not.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 418 patients participated in the opioid sparing pathway during the study period. Mean (SD) age was 55 (14) and 66% of patients were male. 251 (60%) patients received a prescription for a non-opioid while 167 (40%) did not. Patients who received a prescription used fewer opioids (1.8&plusmn;2.5 vs. 2.4&plusmn;3.0 pills, p&lt;0.019) and reported lower pain scores in the week after surgery (1.2&plusmn;0.8 vs. 1.5&plusmn;0.7, p&lt;0.002). Patients who received a prescription also reported higher satisfaction (9.1&plusmn;1.4 vs. 8.8&plusmn;1.7, p&lt;0.049) and were more likely to report that their pain was manageable with an opioid-sparing recovery pathway (94% vs. 87%, p&lt;0.019). The proportion of patients who reported using non-opioid analgesic medications was not different between the two groups (83% vs. 85%, P=0.575).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients participating in an opioid-sparing pathway after surgery reported less opioid use, higher satisfaction, and lower pain scores if they received a prescription for a non-opioid pain medication compared to receiving only counseling to use non-opioids. While all patients should be encouraged to utilize multimodal analgesia after surgery, prescribing non-opioid pain medication has a greater impact on the patient experience than counseling alone.

Previous single-center studies have shown that same day discharge (SDD) after laparoscopic appendectomy is safe in well-selected adults. We sought to determine the safety of SDD after appendectomy in adults using the metric of readmission rate in a sample that is both nationally representative and also captures readmissions to a different hospital.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The 2010-2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) was queried for adults &ge;18 years&nbsp;admitted with uncomplicated&nbsp;acute appendicitis who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. Subjects were stratified into SDD or discharge after one night of observation in the hospital (OBS) groups. Those who died on index admission or were hospitalized &gt;1 day were excluded. Demographics, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics were evaluated. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day non-elective readmission.&nbsp;Univariable analysis identified factors associated with readmission, and multivariable logistic regression identified significant predictors of outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 322,576 subjects identified: 154,028 (48%) were female with a mean age of 36.8 (&plusmn;15) years. Of these, 32,857 (10%) patients were SDD and 289,719 (90%) were OBS. In unadjusted analyses, OBS patients tended to be older (Age 45-64, 23.4% vs 18.9% and Age &ge;65, 5.7% vs 3.9%, p&lt;0.001) and have more comorbidities, including pulmonary disease (6.3% vs 5.8%, p&lt;0.001), diabetes (4.2% vs 3.4%, p&lt;0.001), and hypertension (14.4% vs 11%, p&lt;0.001). However, only age &ge;45 years (45-64y OR 1.29 [1.25-1.33]; &ge;65y OR 1.51 [1.38-1.65]) and hypertension (OR 1.18 [1.13-1.23]) remained independently associated with OBS on adjusted analysis.&nbsp;

The 30-day unplanned readmission rate was 2% (n=7,001). After controlling for covariates, SDD had a lower odds of readmission compared to OBS (OR 0.84 [0.78-0.92]). Risk factors for 30-day readmission overall included age (45-64y OR 1.43 [1.35-1.52]; &ge;65y OR 1.17 [1.03-1.34]) and co-morbidities (hypertension OR 1.33 [1.24-1.42]; diabetes OR 1.16 [1.02-1.32]). The sole distinct risk factor associated with failure of SDD, as measured by 30-day readmission, was the presence of obesity (OR 1.7 [1.31-2.21]).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Same-day discharge after laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis is not associated with increased odds of non-elective readmission at 30 days. Age and comorbidities are predictors of readmission. Further study is needed to identify the ideal candidates for safe same-day discharge.&nbsp;

Frail patients undergoing surgery face increased risk of perioperative complications and death. The American College of Surgeons and the American Geriatrics Society recommend use of a validated frailty assessment for all surgical patients&nbsp;&ge;65 years of age, comprising 53% of over 103 million procedures in the US per year. However, many frailty metrics require in-person evaluation and specialized training. Our objective was to validate the predictive ability of a survey instrument to screen for preoperative frailty.?

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Data were obtained retrospectively from the electronic health record (EHR) of a large urban hospital from 2018-19. Patients undergoing colorectal or general surgery procedures age 65+ were included for analysis. Frailty assessments were performed in the preoperative clinic using the Fried Phenotype. Scores of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments for fatigue and physical function were abstracted from the EHR. Patient demographics were categorized using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Bivariate analysis was performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum, Fischer&rsquo;s exact, and two-sample t-tests. Predictive ability of PROMIS scores was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic curves with cutoffs assigned by metric performance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 158 patients met study criteria, with 28 (17.7%) prefrail, 5 (3.2%) frail. All frail patients had PROMIS &ndash; Fatigue scores &gt;47 and PROMIS &ndash; Physical Function scores &lt;41. The cohort had 87 (55.1%) female patients, of which 15 (17.2%) were prefrail/frail compared to 18 of 71 (25.4%) male patients (p = 0.241). Median Charlson scores of prefrail/frail patients were similar compared to those of non-frail patients (p = 0.724).&nbsp;The mean PROMIS - Fatigue score was higher for prefrail/frail patients than non-frail patients (52.5, SD 8.5 versus 48.4, SD 6.8; p = 0.006). The mean PROMIS - Physical Function score was lower for prefrail/frail patients than non-frail patients (41.4, SD 6.9 vs 48.4, SD 8.1; p &lt; 0.001). A PROMIS - Fatigue score cutoff of &gt;47 predicted frailty with 76% sensitivity and 34% specificity. A PROMIS - Physical Function score cutoff of &lt;44 predicted frailty with 71% sensitivity and 69% specificity.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our analysis found that PROMIS scores were associated with preoperative frailty status in older patients undergoing colorectal and general surgery. Scores were sensitive to predict frailty status but were limited by low specificity. PROMIS instruments may have a role in screening patients for frailty in advance of in-person evaluation to decrease provider and patient burden, and future work may be used to validate these metrics in a broader surgical population.

The sternum is the keystone of the sternal-rib-vertebral complex, which is integral to thoracic cage stability. This study&rsquo;s aim was to evaluate the injury characteristics and outcomes in patients with all types of sternal fractures (SF) after blunt chest trauma.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This retrospective chart review study included 404 patients admitted to two level 1 trauma centers between January 2015 and March 2020 with radiologically confirmed SF. Primary stratification was based on presence of concomitant rib, vertebral, clavicular, or scapular fracture. Analyzed variables included: age, gender, mechanism of injury (MOI), injury severity score (ISS), incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI), need for blood transfusion, need for mechanical ventilation (including tracheostomy), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU length of stay (ICULOS), hospital LOS (HLOS), rates of surgical stabilization, complications, and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Isolated SF (ISF) were present in 33.9% (n=134) of patients and sternal fractures with concomitant fractures of bony structures (CSF) were present in 66.1% of analyzed patients (n=270). The primary MOI in both groups was motor vehicle accident (82% in both groups). Compared to ISF patients, CSF patients had significantly higher ISS (9.3 vs 15.8), TBI incidence (8.2% vs 15.6%), ventilation requirements (11.9% vs 29.3%), tracheostomy rates (3.0% vs 9.3%), ICULOS (4.1 vs 7.9 days), HLOS (7.6 vs 11.1 days), complications (11.9% vs 26.3%), and mortality (0.7% vs 11.9%), all p&lt;0.004.

CSF with rib fracture (CSF-R) was the most frequent CSF pattern (21.5% incidence), followed by CSF with vertebral fracture (CSF-V, 17.8% incidence), and CSF with both vertebral and rib fracture (CSF-RV, 15.6% incidence) [Figure 1]. CSF-V and CSF-R had similar characteristics except CSF-R were more likely to have a pulmonary co-injury. CSF-RV had higher ISS, need for blood transfusion, ventilation requirements, and ICU admission than CSF-V or CSF-R. CSF with clavicular fracture (CSF-C) had greater ISS, pneumo-hemothorax, and TBI incidence when compared to CSF-R and CSF-V (all p&lt;0.002). CSF-C with ipsilateral rib fractures were associated with greater thoracic instability, leading to greater need for surgical stabilization, morbidity,&nbsp;and mortality. Compared to other CSF subgroups, CSF with scapular fracture did not have worse&nbsp;characteristics or outcomes.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Combined SF comprise two-thirds of all SF and are most often combined with rib or vertebral fractures. Isolated SF are generally nonthreatening and are often managed without surgical intervention, while combined SF may lead to destabilization of the chest wall, necessitate surgical stabilization more often, and are a predictor of increased mortality.

Butts<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital,Division Of Acute Care Surgery, Department Of Surgery,New Brunswick, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Damage control laparotomy (DCL) with associated temporary abdominal closure has been increasingly utilized in non-trauma emergency general surgery (EGS). As the population ages, geriatric patients are undergoing EGS operations with increased frequency. Concern exists for their ability to tolerate DCL. We hypothesize that DCL in geriatric EGS does not increase morbidity or mortality and has similar rates of primary closure when compared to a younger cohort.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective chart review from 2015-2020 was conducted at a Level 1 trauma center on all non-trauma EGS patients who underwent DCL with an open abdomen. Demographics, admission lab values, blood product and fluid amounts, length of stay(LOS), rate and time of closure, number of operations, complications, and mortality was collected. Patients aged &lt;65 were compared with those &ge;65. Results were analyzed using Chi square and Wilcox signed rank test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 98 patients (n=50 &lt;65 years; n=48 &ge;65 years) met inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in median number of operations (3 vs 2; p=0.07), time to primary closure (2.5 days vs. 3 days; p=0.45), hospital LOS (19 days vs 17.5 days; p=0.53), ICU LOS (11 days vs 8 days; p=0.33), ventilator days (6.5 days vs 5 days; p=0.56), rate of primary closure (66 % vs 56%; p=0.32), post op ileus(44% vs 48%; p=0.70), abscess (14% vs 10%; p=0.59), need for surgery after closure (32% vs 19%, p=0.14), anastomotic dehiscence (16% vs 6%; p=0.13), or mortality (34% vs 42%; p=0.43). Average time to initial take back did not vary significantly between both groups (45.8hrs vs 38.5 hrs; p=0.88).&nbsp; Patients &ge;65 were more likely to have hypertension (50% vs 83%; p&lt; 0.05) or atrial fibrillation (4% vs 25%; p&lt;0.05). There was no difference in reason for open abdomen (p=0.33), presenting vital signs or lab values. Initial SOFA score was similar for both groups(p=0.75).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;DCL with temporary abdominal closure in geriatric EGS patients achieves similar outcomes and mortality to younger patients. Indication, not age, should factor into the decision to perform DCL.

Heniford<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Carolinas Medical Center,GI & Minimally Invasive Surgery,Charlotte, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Barrier coated meshes were designed to reduce adhesion formation between mesh and the surrounding viscera. Coated mesh has, however, also been purported to have a prolonged inflammatory response and to pose an increased risk of infection compared to uncoated mesh. The objective of this study is to determine if a difference exists in postoperative infection or complication rates between coated and uncoated mesh in patients with CDC Class 1 and 2 wounds.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A prospective, institutional database at a tertiary hernia center identified patients undergoing open preperitoneal ventral hernia repair (OPPVHR) with polypropylene mesh who had CDC class 1 and 2 wounds. Using propensity score matching, a coated and uncoated group were matched based on age, BMI, comorbidities, CDC wound class, and defect size.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 273 patients each in the matched coated and uncoated mesh groups for a total of 546 patients. Patient characteristics for the coated vs uncoated mesh were similar: average age 57.1&plusmn;12.5 vs 58.0&plusmn;12.8 (p=0.26), BMI 33.9&plusmn;7.5 vs 33.8&plusmn;7.4 kg/m2&nbsp;(p=0.77), smoking 15.0% vs 14.6% (p=1.00), diabetes 25.6% vs. 24.5% (p=0.85), CDC Class 1 93.8% vs 94.9% and CDC Class 2 6.2% vs 5.1% (p =0.71), defect size 200.6&plusmn;194.3.4 vs 203.7&plusmn;173.8 cm2 (p=0.99), and mesh size 258.67 vs 283.56 cm2 (p=0.06). The incidence of panniculectomy (33.8% vs 29.1%, p=0.36) was similar, but the coated group had a lower rate of component separation (37.4% vs 51.1%,p&lt;0.01). The coated meshes that were included in this analysis were Ventralight (79.1%) and Proceed (20.9%). The noncoated meshes used were Prolene (66.7%), Bard Soft (23.0%), Prolite (5.5%), and Marlex (4.8%). Overall wound infection rate was significantly higher for the coated mesh group (9.5% vs 4.9%, p=0.04) as were wound dehiscence (5.0% vs 0.8%, p&lt;0.01) and need for IV antibiotics (10.7% vs 4.6%,p=0.01). There was no significant difference in mesh infection (1.9% vs .4%, p=0.12) or intra-abdominal abscess formation (1.3% vs 1.3%, p=1.00). Those patients with coated mesh who developed a wound infection did not have a higher relative rate of reintervention (need for wound vac, drain placement, or re-exploration) compared to the uncoated group (8.4% vs 4.8%, p=0.79). Of the patients with coated mesh who developed a wound 68% had Ventralight mesh and 32% had Proceed mesh. For the patients with wound infections in the uncoated group, 76.9% were Prolene, 7.7% were Prolite, and 5.4% were Bard Soft. Only one patient with a wound infection was from CDC Class 2.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In CDC Class 1 and 2 wounds, the operations in which coated polypropylene mesh was deployed had a significantly higher rate of overall wound complications; however, despite this, there was no increase in mesh infection when compared to uncoated mesh. Coated polypropylene mesh can be used safely in open VHR with no increase in mesh-related complications.

This patient-reported experience study aimed to examine the surgical consent process, comparing the patients&rsquo; experience in elective and emergency settings.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Postoperative patients from January 1<sup>st</sup> to July 31<sup>st</sup> 2020 were invited to participate in a survey on the surgical consent process &ndash; including perceived priorities, information provided, and overall experience. Included elective cases were breast and endocrine procedures; emergency procedures were appendicectomy, cholecystectomy, trauma laparotomy, abscess drainage and repair of incarcerated or strangulated hernias. Incomplete surveys were discarded. Standard statistical techniques were used, with a significant p-value of &lt; 0.05.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 257 patients were invited, with 75 (29 %) completed responses. More patients underwent elective surgery (N = 46, 61 %; 54 % male; mean age 53 &plusmn; 17 years) than emergency surgery (N = 29, 39 %; 45 % male; mean age 39 &plusmn; 17 years). Emergency patients were more likely to sign the consent form regardless of its contents (93 % vs 52 %, p &lt; 0.001) and more likely to be influenced by external pressures (69 % vs 2 %, p &lt; 0.001), such as pain (55 %), analgesia (45 %) and fatigue (38 %). Elective patients were more likely to want to discuss their surgery with a senior surgeon (65 % vs 24 %, p = 0.001) and more likely to seek advice from external sources (76 % vs 14 %, p &lt; 0.001). Elective patients sought advice from sources such as their family doctor (77 %), the internet (57 %) and family members (29 %), whereas Emergency patients universally used the internet to source additional information (100 %), if at all. The majority of elective and emergency patients had confidence in the information provided (98 % vs 93 %, p = 0.55), had the opportunity to ask questions (100 % vs 90 %, p = 0.55) and were satisfied with the consent process (100 % vs 90 %, p = 0.55). When asked to prioritise statements surrounding their consent experience, the top 3 priorities were: the ability to ask questions (61 %), meeting the operating surgeon (44 %), and details of the expected post-operative course (44 %).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This study shows patients have a range of different priorities in preparation for surgery. Therefore, each consent process should be tailored and patient-focused. Emergency patients are significantly more likely to perceive their decision is impaired and would give consent regardless of the information provided; while elective patients put more emphasis on sourcing additional information. Most patients value meeting the treating surgeon and the opportunity to ask questions.

Given the frequency of incisional hernia following laparotomy and the complications associated with hernia repair, materials to serve as alternatives to permanent, synthetic mesh have been developed with the goal of optimizing repair. Despite unique features, wound contamination remains a distinct challenge with all mesh materials. The purpose of this study was to compare absorbable&nbsp; mesh hernia repair outcomes in relation to wound contamination [clean (I) vs contaminated (II-IV)].

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
With IRB approval, databases were searched to identify all cases of open ventral hernia repair with absorbable mesh implant performed at an academic medical center from 2013 to 2017. Local NSQIP data was utilized for patient demographics, perioperative characteristics, CDC Wound Class, comorbidities, and preoperative lab values. Variables obtained via electronic medical record review included hernia defect size, mesh size, postoperative wound events to six months, length of all follow up, and incidence of hernia recurrence. Fisher&rsquo;s Exact Test, Pearson&rsquo;s Chi Square, independent t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used as appropriate for data analyses. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
112 cases meeting inclusion criteria were identified, 76 patients with CDC Wound Class I, &nbsp;36 in CDC Wound Class II-IV. Both cohorts were comparable in baseline characteristics, risk factors and comorbidities, excluding diabetes (33.3%&nbsp;vs 15.8%, p=0.048), prior hernia repair (61.1% vs 34.2%, p=0.009) and parastomal hernia (44.4% vs 3.9%, p&lt;0.001) for classes II-IV and I, respectively. Preoperative laboratory values did not vary between groups. Wound Class II-IV expressed greater lengths of hospital stay, emergent/urgent presentation (p=.03), requirement of bowel resection as part of surgical procedure (p&lt;0.001), mesh size implanted (p =0.04), surgical site infection (excluding deep infection), and wound disruption (p-values &lt;0.05). Correspondingly, higher wound class was associated with increased need for hospital readmission (38.9% vs 11.8%, p=0.002). Despite higher rates of complications, cohorts did not differ in the frequency of hernia recurrence (8.3% for Wound Class I vs 5.3% for Wound Class II-IV, p=0.679).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Absorbable mesh repair patients with contaminated wounds exhibited more emergent presentations, more often requiring bowel resection, readmission, and increased mesh size compared to patients with clean wounds. Despite these differences, absorbable mesh is effective in minimizing hernia recurrence regardless of wound classification.

While elevated body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for the development of gallstone disease, it has also been associated with inferior outcomes following cholecystectomy. Given the controversy regarding the perioperative impact of obesity, we examined the effect of BMI on postoperative morbidity and mortality following cholecystectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The 2005-2016 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was retrospectively analyzed to identify adult patients undergoing laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy. Patients were stratified into five groups: BMI&lt;18.5 (Underweight), BMI 18.5-24.9 (Normal Weight), BMI 25-29.9 (Overweight), BMI 30-34.9 (Obese), and BMI&gt;35 (Morbidly Obese).&nbsp; The primary outcome of the study was 30-day mortality, while secondary endpoints included postoperative bleeding, wound infections, and 30-day&nbsp;readmission. Logistic models were used to identify independent associations of covariates with outcomes of interest.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 327,473 patients undergoing cholecystectomy, 1.0% were underweight, 19.5% normal weight, 30.3% overweight, 24.0% obese, and 25.2% morbidly obese. Underweight patients were on average older (38.8 vs. 31.7 years, p&lt;0.001) but had lower rates of diabetes mellitus (7.2 vs 17.9%, p&lt;0.001) and hypertension (29.5 vs. 40.9%, p&lt;0.001) relative to&nbsp;morbidly obese patients. Underweight patients also had higher rates of metastatic cancer (1.6 vs 0.3%, p&lt;0.001)&nbsp;and were more likely diagnosed with chronic cholecystitis (10.7 vs. 6.1%, p&lt;0.001). After accounting for surgical indication, approach, and baseline differences, we found underweight patients to be at significantly higher risk of mortality (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.53; p=0.029) and postoperative bleeding (AOR=1.45; p=0.011) relative to normal weight patients. In contrast, morbidly obese patients were at lower risk of mortality (AOR=0.63; p&lt;0.001) and postoperative bleeding (AOR=0.63; p&lt;0.001). However, morbidly obese patients were at increased risk of postoperative wound infection (AOR=1.24; p&lt;0.001) relative to normal weight patients, whereas underweight patients were not at increased infectious risk&nbsp;(AOR=0.93; p=0.636). Notably, readmission rates were&nbsp;higher for underweight (AOR=1.37; p=0.004) but&nbsp;lower for morbidly obese&nbsp;(AOR=0.75; p&lt;0.001) patients relative to normal weight patients.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
After controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, underweight patients were at increased risk of mortality, postoperative bleeding events, and readmission relative to normal weight patients. Morbidly obese patients with BMI&gt;35 appear to only be at increased risk for infection. These findings may better guide choice of intervention&nbsp;and preoperative optimization.

While new chemotherapeutics and targeted agents have provided survival benefits, CRS with HIPEC is the only potentially curative treatment, providing longer survival rates. In the same time, there are recommendations against the use of CRS/HIPEC in elderly patients as it&rsquo;s short- and long-term outcomes are still unclear.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;From January of 2011 to July of 2019, patients with peritoneal malignancies at 70 years of age or older who underwent CRS/HIPEC at University of Miami Hospital or Jackson Memorial Hospital were prospectively identified. Pre- and post-resection Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) scores, extent of resection, complications, and length of hospital/ICU stay, overall survival and follow-ups were analyzed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of 195 patients,&nbsp;ten patients were&nbsp;identified: the median age was 74 years (70-83), 60% were female, and 40%&nbsp;Hispanic. All patients had an ASA score of 3. The primary tumors were appendiceal mucinous (30%), mesothelioma (20%), intestinal (20%), gastric (10%), and unknown primary (20%). Four patients had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Mean length of operation was 8.8 hours (7.6-10.5). Mean estimated blood loss was 325 mL (100-2,000), with 60% patients receiving blood transfusion. Mitomycin-C was the chemotherapy agent most commonly used (70%), then oxaliplatin (20%) and cisplatin (10%). Peritoneal cancer index (PCI) ranged from 3 to 27 and eight of ten patients achieved a completeness of cytoreduction score (CCR) of 0. Mean length of hospital stay was 10.5 days, with mean ICU admission of 4 days. Postoperative complications were: 4 pleural effusions which required drainage, one anastomotic leakage, and one deep vein thrombosis. No postoperative ileus or intra-abdominal abscess was found. The median follow up was 11 months and 1-year overall survival rate was 100%. Seven patients are alive, four with no evidence of disease.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this preliminary series, CRS with HIPEC seems to be a safe and feasible surgical option in elderly patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Careful patient selection and implementation of proper postoperative care can reduce risk of complications. Given a rapidly aging patient population and limited literature, further studies are required to elucidate better predictors of surgical outcomes and assess quality of life in patients over the age of 70.

For patients presenting with acute appendicitis, we sought to determine whether time of arrival to Emergency Department (ED) triage is associated with time-to-intervention and clinically important outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The EAST Appendicitis Study database was queried for adults presenting with acute appendicitis treated with either appendectomy (appy) or percutaneous drainage (PD) from 01/17-06/18. Subjects were stratified into groups according to ED Triage Time: 7a-3p (Day), 3p-11p (Swing), and 11p-7a (Night). Outcomes of interest were time from ED triage to intervention (TTI) recorded in 6-h intervals, length of stay (LOS), and in-hospital complications (surgical site infection, intra-abdominal abscess, wound complications, and all Clavien-Dindo complications) . Bivariate analysis, ANOVA, and Chi-square test were used to compare outcomes between groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
3372 subjects were included: median age was 38 [27-54] years, 1917 (53%) were male, and median hospital LOS was 1 [1&ndash;2] days. 3262 patients were treated with appy and 110 with PD. Subjects fell into the three groups as follows: Day (n=1274), Swing (n=1400), and Night (n=698). Demographics and outcomes are summarized in the Table. TTI was significantly longer for Swing shift compared to Day shift (p=.016), however there was no difference in outcomes or LOS between these groups. There was no difference in TTI between Day and Night shifts (p=0.38), however LOS was longer for Day (1[1-2] days) compared to Night (1[0-2] days) shifts (p=.036). There was no observed difference between shifts for any in-hospital complications.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In patients presenting to the ED with acute appendicitis, ED arrival during Swing shift is associated with an increased time-to-intervention, however this was not associated with worse clinical outcomes. Arrival during Day shift was associated with longer hospital stay.

Bacterial colonization of bile has previously been demonstrated to be associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Whether the risk of postsurgical complications varies by the composition of biliary flora identified intraoperatively, currently remains unclear.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single-institution, retrospective analysis was performed; all patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with intraoperative bile cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) for pancreatobilliary malignancies between January 2010 and May 2020 were included.&nbsp;&nbsp;Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of organisms isolated with biliary cultures on outcomes of interest - surgical site infection (SSI), delayed gastric emptying (DGE), pancreatic fistula, duration of drains and total hospital length of stay (LOS).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 110 patients were included; 55% of which were male and 45% female. Sixty-seven percent of the patients had preoperative endoscopic stenting. Overall, 20% of the patients developed SSI, 15% developed DGE, and 11% developed a pancreatic fistula. The mean LOS was 9.1 days (SD 4.6) and the mean duration of drains was 12.1 days (SD 16.1). Only 18% of the patients did not demonstrate any growth (sterile), and the majority of patients had polymicrobial growth on cultures; with&nbsp;Enterococcus being the most commonly isolated organism (41%). Upon univariate analysis, Candida (9%) was associated with an increased risk of SSI (OR 4.77, 95% CI 1.25, 18.29; p=0.02) and an increased risk of pancreatic fistula (OR 5.67, 95% CI 1.21, 26.48; p=0.03). Patients with&nbsp;Streptococcus had 5.2 days longer duration of drains (p=0.05); however after adjusting for patient and cancer characteristics, this was no longer statistically significant. No meaningful differences were observed in rates of DGE and hospital LOS by microbial type.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

This study demonstrates significant variations in the risk of postoperative complications based on the composition of biliary flora. Interestingly, Candida was demonstrated to be associated with postoperative pancreatic fistulas, which has not been previously reported. This study highlights the need for further investigation into identification of biliary flora and its impact on immune microenvironment, which may explain the differences observed in postoperative complications.

With advancement in the surgical treatment of metastatic liver disease, many patients with stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) are experiencing improvement in overall survival (OS). However, given that rural patients often experience disadvantages when accessing specialized healthcare, there is a concern that a rural-urban disparity may exist regarding surgical treatment and survival in patients with CRC liver metastases.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

National Cancer Data Base was used to identify patients from 2006-2016 with stage IV CRC with a confirmed liver metastasis. Univariate Chi square test and multivariable logistic regression was used to examine subgroup differences based upon urban-rural status (Metropolitan/Urban/Rural). Kaplan Meier Method and Cox proportional hazard model were used to examine associated survival in patients with hepatic CRC metastases based upon rural-urban status. Further analysis was performed to examine these differences in patients who received metastectomy only stratified by rural-urban status.&nbsp;



<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A majority of the patients included in this study were residents of metropolitan areas, with 16.6% (6,441/38,833) of patient residing in non-metropolitan communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients in rural communities were more likely to be male, Caucasian, have government insurance, and receive treatment at a community cancer program as opposed to an academic institution compared to patients residing in metropolitan areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;When comparing overall survival of all patients with CRC liver metastases, rural status was associated with worse median survival (15.2 months) compared to patients in a metropolitan area (17.7 months) (p=.007).&nbsp;&nbsp;When controlling for demographic characteristics including age, race, facility type, and insurance type, rural status was associated with 13.3% higher mortality when compared to metropolitan residents (HR 1.13, p=.032).&nbsp;However, when limiting analysis to only those who had received metastectomy (n=5,220), there was no difference in overall survival when comparing rural-urban status (HR 0.98, p=0.88).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

This study demonstrates an existing disparity of rural-urban status regarding overall survival in metastatic CRC liver disease, with rural patients experiencing significantly worse overall survival compared to patients in metropolitan areas. However, when comparing patients who underwent surgical resection of metastatic disease, there was no difference in overall survival when comparing metropolitan and rural residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;These results suggest that appropriate access to facilities with specialized capabilities of hepatic surgical resection could potentially decrease survival disparities among rural patients with CRC liver metastases.

The Whipple is a complex procedure with associated high costs of care. We hypothesized that two attending surgeons working together simultaneously would have improved total costs of care at a healthcare system level. These cost reductions would be driven by improved efficiency and quality metrics during the perioperative period.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was a retrospective study at a single institution. Patients who had undergone a Whipple procedure or total pancreatectomy were identified by chart review. Two groups were identified based on the presence of two fellowship trained surgeons operating together versus a single surgeon with a resident or non-simultaneous support. We collected financial data from our business office for these groups. Quality metrics were then collected.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
&nbsp;

There was reduced costs in the two-physician group compared to the single physician group. Direct operating room (OR) costs were a mean of $5,964 vs $8,872 (p&lt;0.001). Indirect OR costs of $5,149 vs $8,052 (p&lt;0.001), with the sum of OR costs an average of 34% lower; $11,113 vs $16,925 (p &lt;0.001), a difference of $5,811. Total costs, to include everything within the 90-day period, were also significantly lower, $38,070 vs $56,663, (p =0.038). Overall, the total costs were 33% lower in the two-physician group with an average reduction of $18,593. Most of the cost reduction, 69%, was in post-operative care.

We then evaluated our quality metrics to identify the main drivers of cost reduction. Patients who underwent two-surgeon Whipple had statistically significant lower operative time (383 versus 611 minutes, p&lt;0.001), length of stay (11.4 versus 15.6 days, p=0.01), 90-day ICU admission rates (43.2% versus 70.8%, p=0.002) and overall complications (41.9% versus 62.0%, p=0.04).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Patients who underwent Whipple procedure with simultaneous two surgeons had remarkedly reduced operating room costs and total costs within the 90-day window. These were driven by improved quality metrics, including reduced operative time, length of stay, ICU admissions and complication rates. Overall, we feel the two-surgeon Whipple model should be incentivized at healthcare system and payer level to improve quality and reduce costs of care for the Whipple operation.

The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and post-procedural safety outcomes of intraoperative ERCP (IOERCP) during LC in a single setting with that of preoperative ERCP (POERCP) + LC conducted in two separate sessions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Randomized controlled trials and retrospective or prospective cohorts that compared one-stage laparo-endoscopic (rendezvous) technique with a two-stage (POERCP+LC) approach were included and data were pooled in the form of metanalysis. The primary outcomes of the study were CBD stone clearance, overall mortality rate, hospital length of stay, postoperative complications, and total operative time while secondary outcomes were the rate of conversion of laparoscopic to an open procedure and cost-effectiveness.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of fourteen studies comprising 1599 participants were recognized, out of which 747 patients underwent single-stage while 852 had two-stage procedures performed. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of stone clearance from CBD (OR=1.85, p=0.10), post-operative pancreatitis (OR=0.52, p=0.11), complication rate (OR=0.66, p=0.10) and operative time (MD=19.58, p=0.20). However, the study reported significantly decreased conversion rate to open surgery (OR=0.50, p=0.02), decreased length of stay in the hospital (MD= -2.81, p=0.005), and significant cost reduction (SMD= -0.59, p=0.005) in one-stage as compared to two-stage procedures. Mortality was reported in only one patient in a single-stage group in one study.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;One-stage approach is found to be similar in efficacy and safety in terms of stone clearance, postoperative pancreatitis, complications, and operative time, but is superior to two-stage with respect to conversion rate, hospital length of stay and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, it is proving to be a preferred modality of treatment in patients with cholelithiasis and concomitant choledocholithiasis.

We sought to assess trends in the use, as well as outcomes of patients undergoing simultaneous versus staged resection for synchronous CRLM.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients undergoing resection for CRLM between 2008 and 2018 were identified using an international, multi-institutional database.Utilization of simultaneous resection of CRC and CRLM was&nbsp;examined over time. Short- and long-term outcomes following simultaneous versus staged resection for synchronous CRLM were evaluated following propensity-score matching (PSM).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Among 1,116 patients undergoing resection for CRLM, 690 (61.8%) patients had synchronous disease. Among individuals with synchronous disease, 314 (45.5%) patients underwent simultaneous resection, while 376 (54.5%) had staged resection. The proportion of patients undergoing simultaneous resection for synchronous CRC and CRLM increased over time (2008: 37.2% vs. 2018: 47.4%, p<sub>trend</sub>=0.02). The temporal trend was almost entirely due to an increase in simultaneous minor liver resections (2008: 32.6% vs. 2018: 47.4%, p<sub>trend</sub>=0.03), whereas simultaneous major liver resections remained limited over time (2008: 4.7% vs. 2018: 0%, p<sub>trend</sub>=0.10)(Figure). The use of minimally invasive surgery for simultaneous CRLM resection remained low over time (2008: 2.3% vs. 2018: 0%, p<sub>trend</sub>=0.27). After PSM (n=168 per group), patients undergoing simultaneous resection for synchronous CRLM had a higher incidence of overall complications (52.4% vs. 32.1%, p&lt;0.001) and severe complications (Clavien-Dindo &gt; III)(22.0% vs. 4.8%, p&lt;0.001). The incidence of severe morbidity did, however, decrease over time (2008: 50% vs 2018: 11.1%, p<sub>trend</sub>=0.02) (Figure). In addition, 90-day mortality (3.6% vs. 1.2%, p=0.15) and 90-day readmission (7.7% vs 4.2%, p=0.17) were similar among patients undergoing simultaneous versus staged resection, respectively. Median and 5-year overall survival were also comparable among patients undergoing simultaneous versus staged resection of CRLM (simultaneous vs. staged resection; median OS, 58.1 months [95%CI: 42.9-73.2] vs. 45.2 months [IQR: 38.9-51.5]; 5-year OS, 48.4% vs. 37.8%, p=0.41).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The utilization of simultaneous resection for synchronous CRC and CRLM has increased over time at major hepatopancreatobiliary centers. While simultaneous resection was associated increased morbidity, the incidence of severe morbidity decreased over time. Long-term survival was comparable following simultaneous versus staged CRLM resection. Simultaneous resection of synchronous CRLM should be strongly considered at major centers.&nbsp;

It is widely perceived that survival depends on tumor stage. Recently, platelet-albumin-bilirubin (PALBI) score was reported to be superior to Child-Pugh classification and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score in terms of mortality prediction. Trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE) is a minimally invasive therapy used as bridge for liver transplantation or resection. The aim of this study is to assess pre-TARE PALBI score prognostic performance among other liver function scores and/or inflammatory markers.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We retrospectively assessed all patients with HCC that underwent TARE between February 2008 and January 2020. Demographic characteristics; and laboratory values were collected to calculate Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), ALBI, PALBI, platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) within six months before TARE. Results are presented as proportions and median (IQR). Continuous variables were transformed into qualitative or ordinal variables according to maximally selected rank statistics of the given parameter. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for overall survival.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 212 patients were included, 72% were males and the median age was 64 (57-69). TARE was used as intention-to-bridge in 60% of cases. Of all cases, 82% were treatment-na&iuml;ve. The median tumor size was 3.7 (2.6-6.2) cm with 57% having unifocal lesions. The median pretreatment values were: neutrophils (NE) 2.8 (2.1-3.9) x 10<sup>3</sup>/mL, MELD 9 (7-11), ALBI -2.09 (-2.45 to -1.72), PALBI -2.23 (-2.45 to -2.01), PLR 100 (66.2-141.4), and NLR 2.61 (1.85-4.36). Destination therapy (OR=3.6: 95%CI 2.5-5.3; p&lt;0.0001), pretreatment with chemotherapy alone (OR=7: 95%CI 3.3-15; p= &lt;0.0001), size (OR=1.1 per cm increment: 95%CI 1.1-1.2; p&lt;0.0001), NE (OR=1.2: 95%CI 1.1-1.3; p&lt;0.0001), and PALBI (OR=1.7: 95%CI 1-2.8; p=0.035) were significant in univariate Cox regression. MELD and ALBI score were not significant. NE, PALBI and tumor size were transformed into binomial variables. Optimal cutoffs for NE and PALBI were calculated at 2.5 and -2.33, respectively. Size cutoff was set at 3cm to follow our institutional algorithm. Multivariate Cox regression showed a C-index of 73 with a global p-value &lt;0.0001 (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;To our knowledge, this is the first report of PALBI as prognostic factor in patients undergoing TARE. Interestingly, the multivariate cox regression showed us other important factors available at the time of medical decision-making. These results can improve our patient selection for&nbsp;TARE.

Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is utilized with increasing frequency for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and is associated with fewer pancreatic leaks.&nbsp; It is unclear whether these associations apply to patients with advanced age, marginal performance status, or lifestyle-limiting comorbidities; considered &lsquo;borderline-C&rsquo; (BR-C). &nbsp;Some argue that NAT will decrease their ability to tolerate pancreatectomy.&nbsp; We sought to investigate the relationship of NAT use and BR-C status on outcomes following pancreatectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We used National Surgical Quality Improvement Program targeted pancreatectomy data from 2014-2018 and analyzed adults undergoing pancreatectomy for PDAC.&nbsp; We characterized the utilization of NAT according to patients&rsquo; BR-C status and assessed the relationship of NAT and BR-C on postoperative outcomes using propensity score matching techniques.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified 14,100 patients who underwent pancreatectomy for PDAC in ACS-NSQIP hospitals between 2014-2018, of which 4,446 (32%) were BR-C by age, performance status, or comorbidities.&nbsp; NAT use increased over time, but was consistently less utilized in BR-C patients.&nbsp; BR-C patients underwent proportionally more pancreatoduodenectomies (PD) compared with more robust patients (78.1% vs 75.4%, p&lt;0.01).&nbsp; Overall complications were increased in NAT patients regardless of BR-C status, explained entirely by increased rates of post-operative blood transfusion (22% vs 15% in robust patients, p&lt;0.001; 31% vs 23% in BR-C patients, p&lt;0.01).&nbsp; In robust and BR-C patients, NAT was associated with decreased rates of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) (6% vs 11% in robust patients, p&lt;0.01; 6% vs 9% in BR-C patients, p=0.03).&nbsp; In BR-C patients NAT was associated with decreased delayed gastric emptying (DGE) (12% vs 18%, p=0.02), especially for patients undergoing PD that received chemotherapy and radiation.&nbsp; NAT was not associated with increased mortality in BR-C patients (p=0.428).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Despite their frailty, BR-C patients are more likely to undergo PD and less likely to receive NAT. &nbsp;NAT is safe even in BR-C patients as the relationship between NAT and associated complications, particularly fewer clinically relevant pancreatic leaks and DGE, is the same for BR-C and robust patients. NAT should be considered more strongly in BR-C patients.

We therefore sought to characterize the incidence and impact of this condition. We hypothesized that elevations in serum enzymes would increase morbidity and mortality following PD.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Retrospective review of 677 patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy at a single institution from 2013-2019. Patients with at least one serum lipase or amylase value within 48 hours post-operatively were included. Patients were categorized into three groups: (1) Normal: post-operative serum enzyme values within normal limits; (2) Post-operative serum hyperamylasemia (POSH): post-operative serum enzyme values greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) but less than three times the ULN; and (3) Post-operative acute pancreatitis (POAP): post-operative serum enzyme values greater than three times the ULN. Pancreatic gland texture was identified by the operating surgeon, major morbidity was defined as Grade 3+ according to the Clavien classification, and post-operative pancreatic fistula and delayed gastric emptying were classified using the ISGPS definition.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;415 of 677 patients had post-operative serum amylase or lipase values within 48 hours post operatively. Of these 415, 243 (59%) were classified as normal, 96 (23%) were classified as having POSH, and 76 (18%) were classified as having POAP. Tobacco use, incidence of diabetes mellitus, and pre-operative weight loss differed among groups (Table). Soft pancreas gland texture was less common in patients with normal enzymes (26%) compared to patients with POSH (66%) and POAP (81%) (p &lt;0.001). This finding was similar when considering etiology (see table). Patients with normal enzyme levels had larger pancreatic ducts (23% &gt;6mm) compared with POSH (10% &gt;6mm) and POAP (0% &gt;6mm) (p &lt;0.001). Major morbidity following PD was lower among patients with normal enzyme levels (10%) and higher in patients with POSH (23%) and POAP (18%) (p = 0.008). Specifically, patients with normal enzymes were less likely to develop post-operative pancreatic fistula (5%) compared with patients with POSH (26%) and POAP (21%) (p &lt;0.001) and less likely to develop delayed gastric emptying (9% versus 23% and 20%, respectively); p = 0.002. No difference was seen among groups with regard to mortality (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Elevated serum pancreatic enzyme levels occur frequently after PD and are associated with an increased risk of post-operative morbidity. Serum enzyme concentration should be considered in post-PD management. &nbsp;

Laparoscopic and robotic approaches to hepatic resection have been increasingly adopted for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies have reported an association between minimally invasive approaches and improved outcomes, though data on the national use of these procedures are limited. The purpose of the present study was to examine trends in utilization as well as clinical outcomes and resource use following open, laparoscopic and robotic hepatic resection over an 8-year period.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All adults (&ge;18 years old) undergoing hepatic resection for HCC were identified using the 2010-17 National Inpatient Sample. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions codes were used to tabulate relevant patient and operative characteristics. Parametric (P-Trend) and nonparametric rank-based (NP-Trend) tests were used to assess temporal trends in categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality while secondary outcomes included any perioperative complication (neurologic, renal, cardiovascular, respiratory, infectious), length of stay and inflation-adjusted hospitalization costs.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 67,051 patients undergoing hepatic resection, 82.9% utilized an open approach while 10.7% and 6.4% used laparoscopic and robotic methods, respectively. Although overall hepatectomy volume remained steady during the study period, utilization of laparoscopic and robotic approaches significantly increased (Figure). In-hospital mortality decreased significantly in all patients undergoing hepatic resection, from 2.7% in 2010 to 1.2% in 2017 (P-Trend&lt;0.001) (Figure). This reduction was primarily driven by improvements in open approaches (2.6 to 1.2%, P-Trend&lt;0.001). Similarly, the incidence of perioperative complications decreased in all cohorts (P-Trend&lt;0.001). Although length of stay decreased during the study period (7.7 to 6.1 days, NP-Trend&lt;0.001), no significant changes in costs were appreciated across all groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Utilization of laparoscopic and robotic approaches to liver resection have significantly increased in the United States from 2010-2017. Concomitantly, there were overall improvements in outcomes including in-hospital mortality, complications and resource utilization, primarily driven by improvements in those undergoing open liver resection. With each operative approach demonstrating improved overall safety, appropriate patient selection will further optimize outcomes among those with HCC amenable to resection.

We aim to determine whether SR or MCT is associated with superior long-term survival for patients receiving single-modality therapy.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients with stage I-IIb pancreatic head adenocarcinoma who received either MCT (+/- radiation) or SR (pancreaticoduodenectomy/total pancreatectomy) alone were identified in the National Cancer Database (2013-2015). Patients who received single agent chemotherapy or had an unknown treatment status were excluded. Following a piecewise approach to estimating hazards over the course of follow-up, conditional overall survival (OS) at 30, 60, and 90 days after treatment initiation was estimated using landmark analyses.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 5,146 eligible patients, 3,103 received MCT alone (60.3%) and 2,043 underwent SR alone (39.7%). SR had an OS disadvantage at 30 (HR 3.99, 95% CI 3.12-5.11) and 60 days (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.4-2.45), but an OS advantage after 90 days (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.55-0.64). In a landmark analysis conditioned on 90 days survival post treatment initiation (Figure), median OS was improved for SR (17.0 vs. 12.2 months, log-rank p&lt;.0001); SR improved OS at 1 (+4.5%), 2 (+20.4%), 3 (+21.3%), and 4 (+15.3%) years (p&lt;.05 for each difference), despite patients being older (median age 72 vs. 67 years, p&lt;.0001) with higher Charlson-Deyo comorbidity scores (&ge;2: 11.2 vs. 8.6%, p=0.006).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;For patients with resectable pancreatic cancer receiving single-modality treatment, SR was associated with superior long-term survival compared to MCT, supporting a role for upfront surgery in this population, especially those at risk of receiving a single therapy.&nbsp;

Rather, &ldquo;Textbook Oncologic Outcome&rdquo;(TOO) has been described in an effort to improve upon the definition of optimal care after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for adenocarcinoma. We sought to examine whether minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (MIPD) increased the likelihood of an optimal postoperative TOO.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients undergoing PD for adenocarcinoma between 2010-2015 were identified in the National Cancer Database. TOO was defined as: R0 resection with AJCC compliant lymphadenectomy (LAD), no prolonged length-of-stay (LOS), no 30-d readmission/mortality, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, MIPD and open PD cohorts were examined after 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) based on age, sex, ethnicity, insurance, comorbidity index, facility type and volume, tumor stage, size, grade, lymphovascular invasion, and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were further stratified based on operative approach and TOO.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Among 12,854 patients who underwent PD, 6,208 (48.3%) were female and median patient age was 66 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of surgery, 11,246 (87.5%) underwent an open PD, while 1,608 (12.5%) underwent MIPD. On unadjusted analysis, no difference was seen in composite TOO rates after an open versus&nbsp;MIPD (23.5% vs. 24.7%, p=0.28). Several individual factors did vary based on operative approach. Specifically, R0 resection (80.4% vs 78.1%), adequate LAD (77.2% vs 73.4%), non-prolonged LOS (80.3% vs 77.0%), as well as no readmission (93.2% vs 91.7%) were more likely among patients who underwent MIPD (all p&lt;0.05). However, on subsequent PSM analyses, there were no differences in the likelihood of R0 resection, adequate LAD, non-prolonged LOS, no readmission, no 30-d mortality, or adjuvant chemotherapy among patients who underwent open versus MIPD; in fact, the overall chance of TOO after open versus MIPD was the same (Figure). Of note, TOO was associated with an improved median OS (no TOO: 21.3 mo vs. TOO: 27.6 mo, p&lt;0.001).&nbsp;&nbsp;While MIPD demonstrated superior OS among patients who did achieve a TOO (median OS, open: 26.5 vs. MIPD: 29.0 mo, p = 0.03), those who did not achieve a TOO demonstrated no difference in median OS (open: 20.5 mo vs. MIPD: 22.2 mo, p=0.08).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Although TOO was associated with a long-term survival advantage, it was only achieved in one in four patients undergoing PD for adenocarcinoma. A minimally invasive approach to PD was not associated with improved outcomes, including the likelihood to achieve TOO, on adjusted analyses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a complex surgical procedure that requires attentive perioperative care. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols have emerged to enhance functional recovery, decrease complications, and reduce hospital length of stay (LOS). We successfully implemented an ERAS pathway for PD to optimize patient care; however, our current mean LOS remains over the proposed ERAS target of 7 days. This study identifies those patients that fail to meet target LOS to determine the causes and areas of ERAS pathway improvement.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Four surgeons worked with the hospital quality team to develop our own institutional ERAS pathway for PD and implemented it in 2017. This study period includes all PD procedures that utilized the ERAS pathway over 3 years (May 2017-2020). Robotic PD procedures were excluded. We reviewed all the medical records of those patients that failed to meet target LOS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 214 PD procedures utilized the ERAS pathway over 3 years. We observed a LOS reduction from pre-ERAS vs post-implementation (mean LOS 10.5 vs 8.5 days, p&lt;0.05); but still failed to achieve our target LOS for the whole cohort. There were 90 patients (42%) that failed to meet the 7 day LOS. The main reason to fail pathway LOS was either ileus or delayed gastric emptying (46/90, 51%), with a mean LOS of 11.5 days. Within this subgroup, patients who required a nasogastric tube (NGT) during the admission had longer LOS (12.4 vs 9.3 days, p&lt;0.05). Additional reasons for patients not meeting LOS are shown in Table 1 (44/90, 49%). These primarily included non-gastrointestinal reasons with the top three including work-up based on leukocytosis and/or concern for pancreatic leak (16/44, LOS 15), desire for additional observation (13/44, LOS 8.5), and orthostatic hypotension (3/44, LOS 10). Of these additional 44 patients, 18 patients underwent computed tomography (on or after POD 7) and 12 patients received an inpatient intervention during the extra LOS (1 drain study, 4 percutaneous drain manipulation or placement, 4 NGT and 10 TPN). In this subgroup, 4 patients had 2 or more of these interventions. ERAS implementation did not increase perioperative complications, 30-day readmission, or mortality. Renal, respiratory, cardiac, and superficial site infections all remained below NSQIP benchmarks.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The most common reasons for PD pathway failure included slow return of gastric or bowel function which are perhaps inevitable in some patients undergoing PD. The remaining patients not meeting ERAS target were often kept for observation without additional intervention. This group represents an actionable cohort to target for improving LOS through surgeon awareness rather than pathway modification.

Hines VA Hospital,Surgery,Hines, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Achieving microscopically negative (R0) surgical margins in gallbladder cancer often requires an en bloc or revisional partial hepatectomy with associated risk of post-operative morbidity and potential to delay adjuvant therapy. Prior studies on the value of margin status in resectable gall bladder cancer have primarily been retrospective case series including small numbers of subjects with histologically positive (R1) margins. The value of a microscopic negative margin remains unclear.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We queried the National Cancer Database to identify patients undergoing surgical resection to R1 or R0 margins for clinical stage I to III adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder between 2004 and 2015. Patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy, those with fewer than 3 lymph nodes assessed, and those with resection to residual macroscopic (R2) disease were excluded. Patients undergoing R0 resection were 1:1 propensity matched to those undergoing R1 resection for age, demographics, Charlson comorbidity index, surgical approach, histopathologic grade, pathologic stage, and adjuvant therapy. Overall survival (OS) profiles for the matched cohorts were compared using the Kaplan Meier method. Statistical significance was determined by log rank test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;1,444 patients met inclusion criteria.1,314 underwent R0 resection; 130 underwent an R1 resection. On univariate comparison, patients undergoing R0 resection tended to be younger (66.2 +/- 0.17 years vs 69.5 +/- 0.44 years, p = 0.004), were more likely to have private insurance (37.8% vs 26.2%, p = 0.029), had smaller tumors (3.29 +/- 0.50cm vs 4.03 +/- 0.89cm, p = 0.003), were less likely to have pathologic stage III disease (12.7% vs 21.5%, p = 0.002), and were less likely to receive adjuvant radiotherapy (29.7% vs 41.5%, p = 0.005). 130 patients undergoing R1 resection were matched to 130 patients undergoing R0 resection. After propensity matching, there were no statistical differences between matched cohorts with regards to age, demographics, comorbid disease state, histologic grade, pathologic stage, and receipt of adjuvant treatment. On Kaplan Meier analysis of matched cohorts (Fig 1), those undergoing R0 resection demonstrated a median overall survival 13 months longer than those undergoing R1 resection (28.7 +/- 0.88 vs 15.2 +/- 1.85 months, p = 0.002).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:&nbsp;In patients presenting with resectable adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder, margin-negative resection is associated with significant improvement in OS. Decisions regarding extent of resection should be individualized. Hepatectomy to clear surgical margins is warranted in patients generally fit for such procedures.

There is little empiric evidence to suggest regionalization is resulting in improved clinical outcomes. We examine the effects of contemporary trends in regionalization on a composite metric of clinical quality for pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), a textbook oncologic outcome (TOO).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We queried the National Cancer Database to identify patients presenting with resectable (clinical stage I and II) pancreatic adenocarcinoma undergoing PD between 2006 and 2015. TOO was defined as a&nbsp;margin negative resection with formal lymph node assessment, no prolonged hospitalization, readmission, or 30-day mortality, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy within 12 weeks of surgery. Facility volume was classified by annual number of pancreatectomies performed based on&nbsp;Leapfrog Group criteria: centers performing 20 pancreatectomies per year were designated as high volume; those performing 11-19 as moderate, 5-10 as low,&nbsp;&lt;4 as very low volume.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 16,394 patients met inclusion criteria. 9,514 (58.0%) underwent PD at high, 2,665 (16.2%) at moderate, 2,635 (16.0%) low and 1,580 (9.6%) very low volume centers. 2,643 (16.1%) patients had a TOO. The proportion of patients treated in high volume centers increased yearly from 46% in 2006 to 64% in 2015 (p&lt;0.01). Annual rates of TOO increased each year from 12.4% in 2006 to 19.6% in 2015 (p&lt;0.01). On univariate analysis, mean TOO rates correlated directly with surgical volume (7.4% at very low facilities vs. 20.0% at high volume facilities (p&lt;0.01). On mixed effects multivariable regression adjusting for patient, tumor, and facility characteristics surgical volume was consistently associated with rates of TOO. Very&nbsp;low (OR 0.35, 95%CI [0.27,0.45]), low (OR 0.47, 95%CI [0.39,0.57]), and moderate (OR 0.74, 95%CI [0.63,0.87]) volume centers all demonstrated lower adjusted odds of achieving TOO than high volume centers (all p&lt;0.01). Positive regional lymph nodes (OR 1.38, 95%CI [1.23,1.54) and facility location in the East North Central United States (OR 1.50, 95%CI [1.11,2.02], p&lt;0.01) were independently associated with increased odds of TOO while age over 75 (OR 0.44, 95%CI [0.37,0.52]) and Charlson comorbidity score&nbsp;&gt;3 (OR 0.52, 95%CI [0.36,0.75]) were associated with lower odds of TOO (all p&lt;0.05). Academic affiliation was not associated with TOO.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Rates of TOO in PD are relatively low across all thresholds of surgical volume. There is a direct association between volume and rate of TOO. Rates of TOO have increased over time as has the percentage of cases done in high volume centers. Such trends support continued efforts to promote regionalization in pancreatic cancer care.

During the COVID19 pandemic, access to healthcare has become&nbsp;limited, and disproportionately so for those in lower socioeconomic demographics. In Alabama, there is a single tertiary care referral center for pancreatic neoplasms. We therefore sought to examine the effect of the COVID19 pandemic on pancreatic cancer patient referrals and subsequent therapy in Alabama.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective analysis of patients presenting to a high-volume tertiary care hospital with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was performed. Two different time intervals were chosen: 10/1/2019-12/31/2019 (pre-COVID19) and 4/1/2020-6/30/2020 (COVID19). Each patient was evaluated in a&nbsp;multidisciplinary clinic and their&nbsp;case was&nbsp;reviewed in tumor board prior to initiating therapy. Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were compared. Diagnostic date was determined by the first appearance of an abnormality on cross-sectional imaging. Zip code of residence was used to estimate median household income using the IRS Individual Income 2017 Tax Statistics.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 101 patients were seen during the time intervals assessed (Pre-COVID19 N=72, COVID19 N=29). Both groups showed similar demographic characteristics with regards to age (median, Pre-COVID19 vs. COVID19: 66 vs. 67 years, P=0.76), sex (%Female, Pre-COVID19 vs. COVID19: 51% vs. 51%, P=1.0), race (%Caucasian: Pre-COVID19 vs. COVID19: 80% vs. 79%, P=1.0), insurance type (%Commercial Pre-COVID19 vs. COVID19: 63% vs. 59%, P=0.82), and median income (Pre-COVID19 vs. COVID19: $51,601 vs. 55,265, P=0.94). Patients diagnosed during COVID19 had a significantly longer time to referral (mean, 46.7 days vs. 27.4 days, P=0.015*), although there was no detectable difference in time to therapy initiation (mean, Pre-COVID19 vs. COVID19:&nbsp;42.3 days vs. 37.4 days, P=0.69).&nbsp;&nbsp;When analyzed by income quartile, patients in the lowest three quartiles had the greatest delay in referral to the tertiary care center (Table 1).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Less than half as many patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are being referred for expert evaluation during COVID19. In this limited data set, there is a significantly longer wait for patients to be referred, especially for those in lower income groups. As&nbsp;the COVID19 pandemic persists, proactive communication to referring physicians about the safety of care should be a priority for patients with pancreatic cancer.&nbsp;

High-quality data support early integration of (SPC) in patients with advanced malignancy and it has been suggested that SPC referral prior to surgery may be beneficial for patients undergoing curative-intent surgical resection. In this study, we aim to evaluate surgeons&rsquo; insights, perspectives, and biases regarding early SPC referral. Specifically, we focus on surgeons that treat pancreatic cancer since this malignancy is highly lethal and surgery is associated with significant morbidity. Our hypothesis is that many surgeons will harbor significant reservations about early SPC referral and co-management.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A qualitative investigation using 1:1 in person (or via zoom) interviews with 40 open-ended questions were conducted. Data accrual continued until theme saturation was achieved. The grounded theory approach was used for data coding and analysis.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 9 interviews were conducted with expert pancreatic surgeons from&nbsp;5 medical centers across&nbsp;the country; 5 males and 4 females. The mean number of years in practice 18 (10-34) and the median number of pancreatic cancer cases performed per year was 55 (IQR 38-80). During preoperative counseling, all surgeons emphasize optimism, hope, and the possibility of&nbsp;cure.&nbsp;All surgeons discuss the likelihood of recurrence as well as postoperative complications, but 70% agree that patients do not fully understand these risks. 90% of surgeons do not initiate a conversation about long term outcomes and end-of-life&nbsp;care citing&nbsp;fear of taking away hope/ motivation for recovery, a perception that patients do not want to discuss this with surgeons,&nbsp;that it would send a mixed message, and time constraints.&nbsp;One surgeon utilizes SPC referral in the curative-intent setting, but only for the highest risk patients.&nbsp;All surgeons were concerned that early SPC referral may interfere with optimism/ motivation, and 30% of surgeons were concerned that SPC may discourage patients from pursuing surgery. There is also concern that SPC providers may not have an adequate understanding of pancreatic cancer therapy. Additional perceived barriers include patient and provider association of SPC with hospice and limited SPC resources.&nbsp;

Discussion:&nbsp;Pancreatic surgeons tend to use SPC intervention later in the course of the disease rather than as an early element of multimodal&nbsp;care. Surgeons are more likely to embrace early SPC if the SPC provider has an in-depth understanding of the multidisciplinary approach to pancreatic cancer. &nbsp;

Using multi-institutional data from the US HIPEC Collaborative, we sought to determine the impact of perioperative allogenic blood transfusions (PABT) on patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent CRS/HIPEC for peritoneal surface malignancy between 2000 and 2017. The association between PABT and demographic, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables was assessed. Propensity score matching was performed to mitigate bias. Univariate analysis was used to compare demographic, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables. We identified factors independently associated with PABT using multivariate analysis.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;There were 1717 patients that met inclusion criteria, of which 510 (29.7%) required PABT. The mean PCI of our cohort was 14.8 &plusmn; 9.3. After propensity score matching (using the covariates of age, sex, BMI, operative time, baseline albumin level, liver resection status, estimated blood loss and baseline hemoglobin level), PABT was independently associated with an increased postoperative risk of pleural effusion, hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, enteric fistula formation, Grade III/IV morbidity, lengthened hospital stay and reoperation (all p &lt; 0.05 on multivariate analysis). Compared to patients that received 1-5 RBC units, patients that received &gt; 5 units had an increased risk of renal impairment, longer ICU stay, and postoperative infections. Finally, PABT was an independent predictor of worsened survival in patients with tumors of appendiceal (RR 3.02, CI 1.79 &ndash; 5.10, p = 0.001). &nbsp;and colorectal (RR 4.33, CI 1.56 &ndash; 12.00, p = 0.005) origin.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Even low levels of PABT in patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC are independently associated with increased risk of infectious and non-infectious postoperative complications, and this risk is increased in patients receiving &gt; 5 RBC units. PABT was an independent predictor of worsened survival in peritoneal carcinomatosis from appendiceal&nbsp;and colorectal primaries.&nbsp;

One-third of VTE events occur after discharge and can be serious enough to warrant readmission. However, there is limited data on readmissions due to VTE. We aimed to determine the rates, outcomes, predictive factors, and costs of readmissions due to VTE at 30, 90, and 180 days after complex cancer operations using a national data set.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using the 2016 Nationwide Readmissions Database, adult patients who underwent cystectomy, colectomy, esophagectomy, gastrectomy, liver/biliary resection, lung/bronchus resection, pancreatectomy, proctectomy, prostatectomy or hysterectomy for a corresponding cancer diagnosis were identified using ICD 10 codes. Outcomes included 30-day, 90-day, and 180-day readmissions to index and non-index hospitals. Readmissions with a primary cause of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary embolism (PE) were selected. Hospital costs, length of stay, and mortality associated with VTE readmissions were analyzed. Factors present at the index operation and associated with readmissions were identified using multivariable logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 126,104 patients included in the study, 30-day, 90-day, and 180-day VTE readmission rates were 0.62%, 1.07%, and 1.74% respectively. A total of 1,449 (1.74%) patients were readmitted within 6 months of surgery for VTE, of which 810 patients (0.96%) were readmitted for PE, and 639 (0.77%) for DVT. The rates of VTE readmissions continued to rise well beyond the 30-day period. The highest rates were seen after cystectomy (3.28%), followed by pancreatectomy (3.14%) (Figure 1). Of the patients that were readmitted for VTE; 473 (32.64%) were readmitted to a different hospital, 74 (5.11%) died, the median length of stay was 4 days (IQR 2.50-6.75), and total hospital cost for the readmissions were $25.6 million. Independent factors associated with readmission for VTE included type of procedure, increasing age (OR=1.17; 95% CI=1.05-1.28), female gender (OR=1.23; 95% CI=1.11-1.37), emergent admission (OR=1.31; 95% CI=1.03-1.68), increased number of comorbidities (OR=1.30; 95% CI=1.06-1.60), and suffering a major postoperative complication during the index admission (OR=2.08; 95% CI=1.85-2.33).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Readmissions due to VTE after major cancer surgery continue to increase well beyond 30 days after surgery. They occur frequently at non-index hospitals and bear a significant mortality/cost burden. These results suggest that the burden of VTE after complex cancer surgery is grossly underappreciated by registries focused on 30-day outcomes. High risk patients would likely benefit from extended VTE prophylaxis.

The aim of this study was to assess whether nRT increases the incidence of POPC in patients undergoing esophagectomy, and especially in patients with pre-existing pulmonary disease (PEPD).


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;&nbsp;The American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried from 2016-2018 for patients undergoing esophagectomy for malignant neoplasm.&nbsp; Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting (IPTW) was used to create balanced cohorts on baseline characteristics in which the control cohort received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT) alone and the treatment cohort received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). POPC were defined as pneumonia (PNA), unplanned intubation (UI), and prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV). The roles of chest incision and tumor pathology were also considered in an odds ratio (OR) analysis. In addition to an analysis on the overall population undergoing esophagectomy for malignancy, a subset analysis was performed on patients with PEPD, which was defined as pre-existing COPD and/or dyspnea.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 1,611 patients met inclusion/exclusion criteria; 227 received nCT and 1,384 received nCRT.&nbsp; After IPTW, there remained an imbalance on pathology with more squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) in the nCRT vs the nCT cohort (8.3% vs 6.6%, p=0.08) and on chest incision with fewer open thoracotomies in the nCRT vs the nCT cohort (36.5% vs 41.1%, p=0.01).&nbsp; All-patient analysis did not demonstrate a consistent&nbsp;association between nRT and POPC. However, on sub-analysis of patients with PEPD, POPC occurred more often in the nCRT cohort. When comparing nCRT to nCT, PNA occurred in 16.8% vs 8.4% (p=0.02), UI in 16.2% vs 9.0% (p=0.05), and PMV in 14.1% vs 4.4% (p=0.002) of patients. There was a trend toward higher odds of POPC in patients with open chest incision in both all-patient and PEPD sub-analysis across all three POPC. In particular, PMV was more frequent in the nCRT cohort (all-patient: OR=1.63, p=0.02; PEPD: OR=2.80, p=0.02) as was UI in patients with PEPD (OR=2.60, p=0.01). UI occurred more frequently in patients with SCC in comparison to adenocarcinoma (AC) in both all-patient (OR=2.01, p=0.02) and PEPD (OR=3.31, p=0.03) analyses.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;In patients with PEPD, there is a statistically and clinically significant increase in POPC with receipt of nRT.&nbsp; The absence of a significant association in the general esophagectomy population suggests any effect of nRT on pulmonary function is not great enough to impact POPC.

The single-item maximizer-minimizer elicitation question (MM1) is a recently validated question that can quickly categorize an individual as a medical &ldquo;maximizer&rdquo; who generally pursues intervention regardless of necessity or a &ldquo;minimizer&rdquo; who generally refuses intervention unless deemed essential.&nbsp;It is unclear whether patients&rsquo; maximizing-minimizing preferences impact their level of decisional conflict or anxiety related to cancer surveillance and recurrence in this context.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;As part of an explanatory mixed-methods study, we administered online surveys to patients recently diagnosed with SLNB+ melanoma at a high-volume institution. Questions included a satisfaction with decision scale (SDS) and 5-point unipolar and bipolar Likert scales addressing cancer surveillance and anxiety. A sample of these patients participated in an explanatory semi-structured interview. We classified interviewees as medical maximizers or minimizers based on their responses to the MM1. We then analyzed quantitative data descriptively and qualitative data thematically according to these groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Participants were distributed across the MM1 as follows: maximizer 60%, neutral 20%, minimizer 20%. Most providers (87.5%) recommended US surveillance over CLND. All maximizers and minimizers followed their providers&rsquo; recommendations. Three-fourths agreed that their decision for US surveillance or CLND was the best for them personally and in line with their personal values; one-fourth were unsure. Despite this, survey data demonstrated that on average maximizers were slightly to moderately anxious when getting ultrasounds (2.2 on unipolar Likert scale), while minimizers were not at all anxious (1.0 on unipolar Likert scale). Moreover, maximizers reported some concern about residual cancer in the lymph node basin compared to minimizers who did not report any concern (4.0 vs 3.0 on bipolar Likert scale). Interviews in which participants discussed decisional conflict touched on ideas of feeling overwhelmed, &ldquo;labeled&rdquo; by a cancer diagnosis, and inadequately treated with SLNB alone.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Medical maximizers may accept their providers&rsquo; recommendations for conservative treatment despite generally preferring to receive intervention regardless of necessity. Decisions that do not align with their underlying maximizing tendences can result in increased decisional conflict, which impacts their overall medical care. This finding highlights the need for ongoing counseling throughout cancer surveillance and survivorship.

Cancer causes significant disruptions to Quality of life (QoL) from diagnosis to well beyond completion of treatment. As such, QOL, assessed by physical function, mental status, and ability to engage in basic social interactions has emerged as an essential patient centric outcome. We aimed to perform a systematic review to summarize QoL issues faced by cancer patients and to identify gaps in knowledge.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a systematic review of literature using PubMed, CINAHL, and Science Direct. Keywords used were &lsquo;Survivorship&rsquo;, &lsquo;Quality of Life&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Cancer&rsquo; and their MeSH derivatives. Original articles published in English, and between the years 2005-2020 were included. Original research articles that utilized a validated questionnaire to measure HRQoL were included while articles using unvalidated questionnaires were excluded. Two independent authors reviewed the title and abstract, and four independent authors reviewed the full-text, with any discrepancies resolved by an independent author. The quality of life was categorized using macro indicators (MAQoL) defined by the National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services. The indicators included work, community inclusion, choices and decisions, self-determination, relationships and satisfaction

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 9,888 studies identified, 269 articles were included for review. These represented a total of 141,875 patients. Cancer survivorship and QOL was most commonly studied for Reproductive cancers (66 articles; 24.6%) followed by Breast (40; 14.9), Head &amp; Neck (36; 13.4%) and Gastrointestinal cancers (34; 12.7%). Majority of studies focused on the Extended and Permanent phase of cancer survivorship (195; 74.3%). By treatment, 206 studies (76.9%) reported QoL outcomes after surgical intervention, 171 (63.8%) after radiotherapy and 165 (61.6%) after chemotherapy. Across all studies, the most affected MAQoLs were Self-Determination (24.3%) and Work (23.1%), revealing the disruptive impact of various oncologic processes and/or their treatment modalities on physical functioning (76.9%) and social functioning (68.3%) specifically, but also indirectly on emotional well-being (64.8%) and pain levels (18.0%) of cancer patients and long-term survivors.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Most studies assessing QoL of cancer patients focus on the post-treatment time period during the Extended and Permanent phase of survivorship. Further research is required to evaluate HRQoL during the Acute phase to help understand the issues patients face after diagnosis and during treatment.&nbsp;

Most investigations aiming to improve prognostication in SB-NET have centered on lymph node involvement. Unlike other NETs, the prognostic utility of preoperative serum chromogranin-A (CgA) in non-metastatic SB-NET is not well studied.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Using the National Cancer Database (2004-2016), we analyzed patients with locoregional SB-NET who underwent curative resection including an adequate lymphadenectomy (n = 1,274). A statistically optimized cut-point was used to dichotomize the patient cohort based on their preoperative serum CgA levels. Clinical features associated with overall survival were analyzed.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Using a CgA cut-point of 139ng/mL, patients with CgA&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;139ng/mL were older (63 years vs. 57 years, p = 0.001), more likely to have well-differentiated tumors (83.6% vs. 78.8%, p = 0.014) or primary tumors &ge;1cm (88.2% vs. 79.2%, p = 0.001), and had a significantly shorter estimated mean overall survival (6.6 years vs. 7.6 years, log-rank p = 0.00001). Independent clinical features associated with shorter overall survival included: preoperative CgA &ge;139ng/mL (HR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.24 &ndash; 3.95; p = 0.007), age at diagnosis (HR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.03 &ndash; 1.09; p &lt; 0.001), Charlson-Deyo score &gt;2 (HR = 3.39, 95% CI 1.44 &ndash; 7.99; p = 0.005), and poorly-differentiated tumors (HR = 11.26, 95% CI 4.14 &ndash; 30.65; p &lt; 0.001). Lymph node metastasis is common in this cohort (n = 1,157; 91%), however, neither lymph node metastasis nor T-stage had an independent association with overall survival in patients with locoregional SB-NET.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Preoperative serum CgA &ge;139ng/mL is an adverse prognostic marker associated with shorter overall survival in patients with locoregional SB-NET. Neither lymph node metastasis nor T-stage was independently associated with overall survival.&nbsp;

Characterizing exceptional (ES) and poor survivors (PS) may help improve prognostication and patient selection for surgery.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Data from a retrospective, 12-institution cohort of low&nbsp;and high&nbsp;grade appendiceal (LGA, HGA) patients treated with CRS/HIPEC that had complete cytoreduction (CC0/1) was utilized. ES and PS were defined as &ge;75<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and &le; 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;percentile of overall survival (OS) respectively. Perioperative variables, OS, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared between ES and PS. Univariate&nbsp;and multivariate&nbsp;analyses (UVA, MVA)&nbsp;identified factors associated with OS and RFS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 888 dAC patients with CC0/1 resection, 664 were LGA and 224 were HGA.&nbsp;In both HGA and LGA patients, OS was significantly different between ES, intermediate, and PS subgroups (Fig.1). For LGA,&nbsp;median RFS for&nbsp;ES vs. PS was 80.6mo vs 13.9mo, p=0.096; for HGA,&nbsp;36.1mo vs 28.4mo, p=0.001.&nbsp;

In comparison to LGA-PS,&nbsp;ES had significantly lower mean BMI (27.3 vs 28.7, p=0.024), higher median CA125 levels (27.7U/ml vs 17.0U/ml, p=0.030), and higher % of patients with CRS without HIPEC (15.1% vs 1.8%, p&lt;0.0001). All LGA patients had PCI scores &le; 20. In LGA-ES, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR 5.2, CI 1.7-15.9, p=0.004) and elevated CA19-9 levels (&gt;37U/ml;&nbsp;HR 10.2, CI 1.1-91/6) were associated with worse OS, however, only elevated levels of CA19-9 remained significant for OS (HR 10.2, CI 1.1-91.6, p=0.038) and RFS (HR 4.5, CI 1.6-12.7, p=0.004) on MVA. In LGA-PS, Clavien-Dindo Grade &ge; 3 (HR 7.2, CI 1.9-26.2, p=0.003) and elevated CEA (&gt;5ng/ml; HR 8.313, CI 0.95-71.7, p=0.05) were associated with worse OS, and remained significant on MVA (HR 10.3, CI 1.1-92.9, p=0.04 and HR 10.3, CI 0.988-106.9, p=0.05 respectively).

HGA-ES had significantly lower nodal positivity (17.1% vs 62.5%, p&lt;0.0001) and higher proportion of patients with CRS without HIPEC (33.9% vs 14.3%, p=0.015). In HGA-ES, perioperative systemic chemotherapy (4.2, CI 1.2-13.9, p=0.021) was associated with worse OS only on UVA. In HGA-PS, higher CA125 level (HR 1.02, CI 1.0-1.04, p=0.044) was associated with worse OS in UVA and remained significant (HR 1.02, CI 1.0-1.04, p=0.044) on MVA.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this large cohort of dAC patients undergoing CC0/1 resection, perioperative characteristics of ES vs PS patients varied based on histological subtype. Elevated tumor biomarkers independently predicted worse OS in LGA and HGA-PS patients.&nbsp;Stratification of outliers by histologic subtype and survival category may provide insight into tumor biology and improve patient selection for surgery.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Treatment for PDA involves an intensive combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation that is often difficult for patients to tolerate. Recent studies have found that patients with PDA have worse quality of life (QOL) measures in all categories compared to patients with other cancer types. Testosterone deficiency is associated with chronic fatigue and weakness in addition to male sexual dysfunction. We have recently discovered that male PDA patients are rarely screened for testosterone deficiency despite reporting symptoms. Additionally, it has been shown that PDA may overexpress androgen receptors playing a role in tumorigenesis and disease progression. Our study aims to determine if male PDA patients have low testosterone levels and if testosterone levels correlated with oncologic outcome.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Serum samples were obtained from a cohort of male PDA patients enrolled in an institutional prospective repository at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center from 2012-2020. Total testosterone (ng/dL) of each sample was measured using ELISA methods. Low testosterone was defined as a level &lt;300ng/dL per the American Urology Association guideline. Demographic and clinicopathologic variables, treatment and outcome data were abstracted. Cox regression models were used to assess the effect of patient and disease characteristics on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Serum samples were available from 89 male PDA patients. Of these patients, 69.7% reported symptoms of low testosterone prior to sample collection, and nearly half (49.4%) were found to have a low testosterone level (median: 202ng/dL; range: 123-294ng/dL). Only 2.2% of patients had a prior testosterone level measured; none received testosterone replacement therapy. Fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom consistent with testosterone deficiency. After adjusting for metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and treatment, testosterone level had no statistically significant effect on PFS (p=0.66) or OS (p=0.95).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Nearly half of the male PDA patients in this cohort were found to have low serum testosterone levels, but very few were tested in the clinical setting despite reporting symptoms. The overlapping symptoms between cancer and testosterone deficiency including fatigue and weakness may be the main reason for the lack of testosterone testing. Since there was no apparent difference in oncological outcome between PDA patients with low or normal testosterone levels, testosterone supplementation is most likely safe and may improve patients&rsquo; QOL allowing them to better tolerate the intense treatment for PDA. Further prospective studies are warranted to explore the role of testosterone supplementation in improving men&rsquo;s health and overall well-being during PDA treatment.

Westermann<sup>1</sup>, D. S. Rhee<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Johns Hopkins University School Of Medicine,Department Of Pediatric Surgery,Baltimore, MD, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Children undergoing cancer treatment often develop leukopenia, which may impair wound healing and increase surgical complication rates. In leukopenic children who develop an acute surgical process, the optimal management strategy remains unclear. This study examined the effect of preoperative leukopenia on postoperative outcomes in children treated for cancer who underwent an appendectomy or cholecystectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was a retrospective cohort study of pediatric cancer patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database from 2012-2018. Patients &lt;18 years old with any active cancer who underwent an appendectomy or cholecystectomy were included. Children receiving other major concurrent operations were excluded. Patient demographics and perioperative characteristics were compared by leukopenia status (WBC &lt;4 vs. &ge;4 x 10^3/mL) using chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables. Primary outcomes of 30-day composite complications, including infections, reoperations, and readmissions, as well as postoperative length of stay (LOS) were analyzed by leukopenia status for each procedure using multivariate logistic and log-transformed linear regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 328 children met inclusion criteria, with 227 (69.2%) appendectomy and 101 (30.8%) cholecystectomy cases. Children were typically male (n=202, 61.6%) and white (n=243, 74.0%) with a median age at operation of 12 years (IQR 8.7-15.1). Leukopenia was seen in 93 (41.0%) appendectomies and 57 (56.4%) cholecystectomies. There were no significant differences in operative time or use of laparoscopy by leukopenic status for either procedure. Nineteen (8.4%) appendectomy patients developed a postoperative complication as compared to six (5.9%) cholecystectomy patients. The mean postoperative LOS was 4.5 days (SD 5.9) for appendectomies and 3 days (SD 4.8) for cholecystectomies. After multivariate analyses, leukopenia was not associated with an increase in postoperative complications for children undergoing appendectomies (OR 0.55, p=0.36) or cholecystectomies (OR 0.39, p=0.37). There was also no significant different in postoperative LOS for patients with versus without leukopenia who underwent an appendectomy (1.27 days, p=0.15) or cholecystectomy (1.08 days, p=0.71).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

In children with active cancer, leukopenia was not associated with increased short-term postoperative complications or longer postoperative LOS after either an appendectomy or cholecystectomy. This suggests delaying procedures for leukopenia in this population might not be necessary.&nbsp;

Imatinib-resistance (ImR) is the strongest determinant of disease progression and mortality in recurrent and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). While 2nd and 3rd-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have prolonged progression-free and possibly overall survival (OS) in ImR GIST, the role of resection in this population remains unclear. We sought to investigate factors predictive of OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with ImR GIST.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A query of our prospectively maintained Comprehensive Cancer Center registry was performed from 2003-2019 for patients with ImR GIST. Clinicopathologic characteristics along with medical and surgical treatments following progression or recurrence on first-line imatinib were collected; OS and PFS were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards modeling.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

N=84 patients developed ImR during the study period at a median age of 59 years and median time to ImR of 50 months following initiation of imatinib. The majority of patients were men (n=49, 58%) and non-metastatic (n=47, 56%) at original diagnosis, with small bowel being the most common primary tumor location (n=37; 44%). ImR most commonly emerged in the liver (n=37, 44%) and peritoneum (n=28, 33%). Sunitinib was the most common second-line TKI (n=71, 85%). The median OS following development of ImR was 51 months (95% C.I. 32-70 months). After being diagnosed with ImR, n=17 (20%) patients underwent resection (either curative-intent or cytoreduction) along with 2<sup>nd</sup> line TKI therapy, while n=62 (74%) underwent TKI therapy alone and n=5 (6%) did not receive further therapy. On multivariable analysis, age at ImR (HR 1.04 per year, 95% C.I 1.01-1.06, p&lt;0.01), KIT mutation (HR 8.38, 95% C.I. 1.9-37.2, p&lt;0.01), and time to failure of 2<sup>nd</sup>-line TKI (HR 0.97 per month, 95% C.I. 0.95-0.99, p&lt;0.001) were independently associated with OS; similar results were noted on subgroup analysis of KIT-mutated tumors. On multi-variable analysis, treatment with sunitinib was associated with worse PFS than other agents (HR 3.70, 95% C.I. 1.44-9.50, p&lt;0.01), while resection after ImR was independently associated with improved PFS (HR 0.50, 95% C.I. 0.27-0.92, p&lt;0.05). In patients treated with 2nd-line sunitinib, surgical resection of metastatic disease was the only factor independently associated with PFS (HR 0.50, 95% C.I., 0.27-0.93, p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Long term survival can be achieved in patients who develop imatinib-resistant GIST treated with additional lines of TKI therapies. Surgical intervention should be considered in imatinib-resistant GIST in appropriately selected patients and is associated with improved PFS.

Farma<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Fox Chase Cancer Center,Surgical Oncology,Philadelphia, PA, USA <sup>2</sup>Fox Chase Cancer Center,Biostatistics And Bioinformatics,Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Signet-ring cell gastric cancer (SRGC) is a variant of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) with&nbsp;worse prognosis compared to non-signet-ring cell gastric cancer (NSRGC). To our knowledge,&nbsp;the overall&nbsp;survival among patients&nbsp;with SRGC histology variant&nbsp;undergoing total/subtotal versus partial gastrectomy has never been reported in a large cohort in the literature.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004-2016 was queried to identify patients with GAC stratified according to histopathology, tumor location and&nbsp;extent&nbsp;of gastrectomy. We performed a Cox proportional hazards regression to assess the impact of surgery type and histo-pathology on overall survival, adjusting for age,&nbsp;race, tumor location in the stomach, clinical stage, histologic grade and chemotherapy. We assessed whether the effect of surgery type differed by histology by including an interaction between the two variables.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Out of 153917 patients with GAC, 17086 (11.1%) were eligible for the analysis. Patients who underwent total/subtotal versus partial gastrectomy were 25.5%&nbsp;(n=770) versus&nbsp;74.5% (n=2246) for SRGC, and 20.9% (n=2943) versus&nbsp;79.1% (n=11127) for NSRGC&nbsp;histology variants, respectively.&nbsp;It was noted that patients who had SRGC were more likely to undergo total/subtotal gastrectomy (25.5% vs. 20.9%. p&lt;0.0001). Distal gastric tumors were less likely to undergo total/subtotal gastrectomy (16.5% vs. 25.4%. p&lt;0.0001).

Patients undergoing partial&nbsp;gastrectomy for the SRGC histology variant have better overall survival (HR=0.68, CI=0.61-0.76; p&lt;0.0001). This is also validated in the NSRGC histology variant, but to a lesser extent&nbsp;(HR=0.91, CI=0.85-0.96; p=0.002). Overall, patients treated with partial gastrectomy for GAC have a better prognosis compared to total/subtotal gastrectomy, although the overall survival benefit is more profound in the SRGC histology variant (p&lt;0.0001).

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our results show that total/subtotal gastrectomy is not associated with improved overall survival in patients who undergo gastrectomy for GAC, even&nbsp;when adjusted for tumor location. The survival benefits of partial gastrectomy are more pronounced in the SRGC histology variant. The worst survival is observed in patients with SRGC who undergo total/subtotal gastrectomy after adjusting to different covariates.

The objectives of this study were to 1) assess the utilization of post-treatment surveillance monitoring and 2) determine the risk of recurrence of LAMNs following surgery.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients who underwent surgical resection of localized LAMNs in a regional healthcare system from 2000-2019 were identified. Patients were assigned to cohorts based on whether post-treatment surveillance was performed. Post-treatment surveillance regimens were characterized based on use of imaging, laboratory testing, and endoscopy. Rates of disease recurrence were evaluated.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 114 patients with LAMNs were identified, including 71 (62.3%) with incidentally found lesions and 39 (34.2%) who presented with symptoms of appendicitis. T stage was pTis for 92 (80.7%), pT3 for 7 (6.1%), pT4a for 14 (12.3%), and pT4b for 1 (0.9%) patient. Ninety-one (79.8%) patients were treated with appendectomy alone and 23 (20.2%) were treated with hemicolectomy. Two patients (1.8%) had a positive resection margin, both after appendectomy. Post-treatment surveillance was performed for 36 (31.6%) patients. &nbsp;Surveillance regimens included office visits for 31 (86.1%) patients, CT scan for 29 (80.6%), MRI for 4 (11.1%), colonoscopy for 13 (36.1%), and serum tumor marker measurement for 12 (33.3%). After a mean duration of 3.4 years following surgery (range: 0.02-16.5), no patients in either cohort experienced tumor recurrence.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date evaluating surveillance and recurrence rates for LAMN without peritoneal spread. Surveillance was common among patients following surgical treatment of LAMN, however, no patients experienced tumor recurrence, regardless of stage or margin status. These findings suggest that routine surveillance following surgical resection of LAMN may be unnecessary and represent overutilization of healthcare resources for most patients.

Understanding the influence of neoadjuvant therapy on LNR can help elucidate the treatment effect and lymph node yield in such aggressive malignancy.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;134 patients diagnosed with resectable, borderline-resectable and locally-advanced PDAC who underwent PD between 2010-2019 were identified. LNR was calculated and used to stratify patients into N0 (LNR=0), N-A (LNR 0-&le;0.1), N-B (LNR 0.1-&le;0.2) and N-C (LNR&gt;0.2) groups. Patients were categorized based on first-line treatment as: surgery first (SF), neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), and total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Utilizing LNR revealed 70 patients (52.2%), 26 (19.4%), 20 (15%) and 18 (13.4) in the N0, N-A, N-B and N-C groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between groups comparing age, gender, and index cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) (p=0.053, 0.42 and 0.78, respectively). Preoperative CA19-9 differed significantly between the groups (29 vs. 68 vs. 40 vs. 318 for N0, N-A, N-B and N-C, respectively; p=0.011). The distribution of clinical stage was similar between the groups (p=0.836). However, the N0 group was associated with lower pathological stage compared to the others (p&lt;0.001). There was no difference in NAT administration across the groups, although a lower TNT administration rate trend was noted as the LNR increased (N0=50%, N-A=27%, N-B=20% and N-C=5.6%, p=0.001). There was no difference in R0 resection rate across all groups (p=0.77). The N0 group demonstrated the least median number of harvested lymph nodes (14), while N-A patients had the highest median (23) (p=0.0247). No difference in adjuvant chemotherapy was seen (p=0.069), although the N0 group received less adjuvant radiotherapy (p&lt;0.001). Patients with node-positive disease demonstrated worse overall survival (OS) compared to the N0 group (HR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6, p=0.004), but no significant survival differences were noted between the N-A, N-B and N-C groups (p=0.813).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:&nbsp;As expected,&nbsp;PDAC&nbsp;patients with LNR=0 had significantly higher OS. LNR had a limited prognostic value in patients with one or more positive lymph nodes. TNT was administrated more frequently in the LNR=0 group and associated with fewer harvested lymph nodes. This is likely explained by the increased treatment response and lymph node obliteration associated with TNT approach.

Intraoperative peritoneal carcinomatosis index (I-PCI) and completeness of cytoreduction surgery (CRS) are predictors of survival in patients with peritoneal surface malignancy (PCM) from multiple gastrointestinal malignancies. However, I-PCI is not a reliable predictor in patients with PCM from appendiceal origin. We sought to analyze the impact of postoperative radiological PCI (PR-PCI) on survival rates in this population.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: From August 2002 to July 2019, 40 consecutive patients with PCM from appendiceal origin undergoing CRS/HIPEC were included in the analysis. Pre- and post-resection Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) scores, extent of resection, complications, and length of hospital/ICU stay were documented and follow-ups were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards model evaluated factors associated with increased mortality. PCI cutoff of 16 was used for both PR-PCI and I-PCI.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The median age of patients were 55 years old (rang of 37-71); 55% were female and 55% Hispanic. 57.5% of the patients had no significant comorbidities; 55% with an ECOG status of 0. 33% had a ruptured appendix on primary resection, 68% extra-appendiceal mucin, 37% intraperitoneal mucin. Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma in 67.5% and low-grade appendiceal neoplasm in 30%. Median exploratory PCI of 20 (0-37); median post-op PCI of 0 (0-34) with 75% had cytoreductive score 0. 75% had no postoperative complications. Complications included:&nbsp;&nbsp;3 had anastomotic leak, 2 wound infections, 2 ileus, 2 fistulas, and 1 DVT. Median follow-up time after CRS/HIPEC was 12.9 months (range 0.5-50), 75% were alive, 42.5% without disease, 22.5% with cancer-specific death. Tumor characteristics, intraoperative variables (including PCI, HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94-1.16) and postoperative complications were not identified as predictors of survival. Mean I-PCI and PR-PCI were 19.1 &plusmn; 11.3 and 4.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&plusmn; 9.3 (p&lt;0.001), respectively. PR-PCI &lt;16 was associated with increased survival rates (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.36,, p=0.005).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:PR-PCI seems to be a more reliable predictor of survival than conventional I-PCI in patients with PCM from appendiceal origin undergoing CRS/HIPEC, likely due to a superior correlation with completeness of resection. In conclusion, to decrease mortality risk, patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of appendiceal origin require achievement of lowest possible postoperative PCI.

Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine malignancy with increasing incidence in the United States. Historically, treatment was limited to surgery, radiation and chemotherapy which was marked by disease progression and survival of 15% in the metastatic setting. More recently immunotherapy has led to nearly 50% early treatment responses. Here we provide our large single institution experience with this diagnosis and changes in management over the last 18 years.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was a single institution retrospective review where the medical record system was queried for ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes corresponding to MCC from 2002-2020. In all, 166 patients were identified to have biopsy proven MCC. Nine were excluded due to incomplete clinicopathologic data, leaving 157 patients evaluable.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Consistent with previous data, 96% of patients were Caucasian, 60% were male with a median age of 75 (range: 41-98). The primary sites were the head and neck 63/157 (40%), trunk or extremities 81/157 (52%) and unknown primary site 13/157 (8%). &nbsp;At the time of most recent follow up 56/157 (35%) of all patients were deceased, with an MCC disease specific mortality of 24%. Twenty-eight of 156 (18%) patients were found to have in-transit disease (ITD), with 19/156 (12%) initially presenting with ITD. The remaining 9 developed ITD after initial presentation. A surgery was performed on 151/156 (96%) patients. The surgeries performed included: wide local excision (WLE) in 57/151 (38%), MOHS in 2/151 (1%), WLE and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in 70/151 (46%), WLE and complete lymph node dissection (CLND) in 13/151 (9%), parotidectomy with SLNB in 1/151 (1%), with CLND in 2/151 (1%), CLND alone in 2/151 (1%) of patients. Radiation therapy was performed in 89/156 (57%). Initial radiation therapy targets included the primary alone in 42/89 (47%), nodal basin alone 3/89 (3%), primary and nodal basin 24/89 (27%), site of metastatic disease 3/89 (3%), and unknown 17/89 (19%). Since the initiation of use of&nbsp; immunotherapy in 2015, 27/88 (31%) of patients received immunotherapy with anti-PD-L1/PD-1 antibodies Of those treated with immunotherapy, 25/27 (93%) were initially treated with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) and 9/27 (36%) of these patients recurred requiring additional treatment. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

MCC is a rare yet fatal disease with multiple treatment algorithms utilized since it was first described in 1972. This institutional experience demonstrates the evolving approach to treatment with increasing utilization of immunotherapy since 2015.

Patel<sup>1</sup>, J. Ricci<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Albany Medical College,Division Of Plastic Surgery,Albany, NY, USA <sup>2</sup>Albert Einstein College Of Medicine,Division Of Plastic Surgery,Bronx, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 


As social media becomes a more pervasive means of marketing and patient education in plastic surgery, it is important to investigate what factors on a social media profile are most important to patients. Platforms such as Instagram have a limited amount of space in which surgeons can describe their training and background on their profile. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a surgeon&rsquo;s training background and years of experience advertised on a social media platform influences perception of surgeon competence, patient recruitment likelihood, and referral likelihood.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A mockup of an Instagram post was created using a before and after picture of a deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap patient (Figure 1). The caption under each post was changed to reflect one of six possible training categories: 1 year of experience, 10 years of experience, 20 years of experience, fellowship, Ivy-league training, and a null case (against which all other cases were compared). Surveys were designed to ask female responders to evaluate surgeon competence, likelihood of becoming a patient, and likelihood of making a referral to their friends or family. Amazon MTurk crowd-sourcing was used to distribute the survey. Demographic data including age, ethnicity, education level, and personal history of breast cancer was collected.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 675 survey responses were recorded. The majority of responders were Caucasian (57%). Both the surgeon with 20 years of experience and the fellowship-trained surgeon had significantly higher patient recruitment scores compared to the null (p=0.0035, p=0.0304). The majority of responders (67%) preferred a female surgeon. Responders with a personal history of &nbsp;breast reconstruction assigned lower surgeon competence scores compared to women without a history of breast cancer (p&lt;.0001). Women who underwent breast reconstruction were also less likely to make referrals to their family and friends (p=.0005).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Surgeon experience influences whether a patient is likely to to seek care from a plastic surgeon. A personal history of breast cancer has a negative impact on perceived surgeon competence as well as patient recruitment likelihood and referral likelihood. Emphasizing lesser years of training or ivy-league training did not make an appreciable difference in patient perception of competence or likelihood of recruiting a new patient.

Clune<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>West Virginia School of Medicine,Morgantown, WV, USA <sup>2</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine,New Haven, CT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for invasive auricular melanoma is standard of care. However, lymphatic drainage from the ear is incompletely understood. The goals of this study are to: 1) assess lymphatic draining patterns in auricular melanoma and 2) to prospectively compare pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy and intra-operative radioisotope sentinel node identification to determine if the methods are equally effective.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
From 1997-2018, patients with melanoma of the ear requiring SLNB were prospectively evaluated with pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy followed by intraoperative radioisotope identification. To identify this cohort of patients, 122 consecutive cases of invasive auricular melanoma were reviewed. Lesion site, pathology, demographic information, and outcomes data were recorded for each patient. Both pre-operative lymphoscintigram and SLNB were performed in 64 patients. Site of pre-operative mapping and site of sentinel node biopsy were recorded as parotid, mastoid, and/or cervical (I-V) for each patient. Comparisons between preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative radioisotope identification were made at both the individual level and in aggregate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Sixty-four patients underwent both pre-operative lymphoscintigram and intra-operative injection of radiotracer with SLNB in this study. On pre-operative lymphoscintigram, 89.1% showed pre-operative drainage to cervical levels I-V, 21.9% showed drainage to the parotid region, and 4.7% showed drainage to the mastoid region. In contrast, intra-operative biopsy was taken from the cervical region in 95.3% of cases, the parotid region in 43.8% of cases, and the mastoid region in 17.2% of cases. Significantly more parotid nodes (p=0.01) and mastoid nodes (p=0.03) were biopsied intra-operatively than were mapped pre-operatively. In total, 33 nodes were biopsied intra-operatively that were not mapped pre-operatively, the majority in the parotid and mastoid regions. Additionally, there were no cases of pre-operative lymphoscintigraphic mapping or intra-operative SLNB outside of the head and neck.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this study, higher rates of intra-operative sentinel lymph node identification relative to pre-operative mapping indicate that sole reliance on pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy may be insufficient in the operative planning and treatment of auricular melanoma. Our data indicate that the surgeon should diligently survey the head and neck intra-operatively with radioisotope injection and gamma probe to uncover sentinel nodes not visualized pre-operatively. Furthermore, the ipsilateral parotid and mastoid regions require particular attention during intra-operative sentinel node identification. Lymphatic drainage from the ear occurs reliably to the ipsilateral head and neck, and the parotid and mastoid regions were sites of frequent biopsy in our study without corresponding pre-operative mapping.

Although the development of behavioral health disorders (BHD)&nbsp;following&nbsp;facial trauma is well-described, current&nbsp;literature fails to characterize how premorbid BHD&nbsp;complicate craniofacial trauma.&nbsp;This study sought to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with premorbid BHD sustaining facial fractures.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;All adults in the 2013-2016 Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) datasets who sustained craniofacial fractures were identified using ICD-9 codes. BHD were defined per DSM-V guidelines, using ICD-9 codes for major psychiatric illnesses, alcohol or drug use disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or dementia. Patient demographics, injury characteristics, and fracture patterns were abstracted. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare in-hospital outcomes in patients with BHD to those without.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 1,006,618 subjects in the TQIP datasets analyzed, 240,104 experienced craniofacial fractures.&nbsp;&nbsp;64,217 patients (25%) had one or more premorbid BHD. Patients in the BHD group were older (46.29 vs 45.77, p &lt;0.001) and more likely to be male (75.5 vs 73.7, p &lt;0.001), with higher rates of smoking, hypertension, and advanced hepatic or respiratory disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;BHD patients were more likely to suffer penetrating injuries (4.9% vs 4.3%, p&lt;0.001), assault (29.9% vs 23.9%, p&lt;0.001), and self-inflicted injuries (2.9% vs 1.2%, p&lt;0.001.&nbsp;&nbsp;BHD patients more frequently experienced nasal fractures (47.0% vs 42.8%, p&lt;0.001), multiple facial fractures (p&lt;0.001), and severe concomitant injuries, including head injuries (odds ratio [OR] 1.08, p&lt;0.001). Operative management of facial fractures was performed at the same rate among patients with and without BHD (79.8% vs 79.8%, p=0.881). BHD patients displayed significantly higher rates of nearly all in-hospital complications measured, including pneumonia (OR 1.41, p&lt;0.001), drug and alcohol withdrawal (4.0% vs 0.3%, p&lt;0.001), unplanned intubation (OR 1.65, p&lt;0.001) and unplanned transfer to the intensive care unit (1.3% vs 0.8%, p&lt;0.001). Overall, BHD was associated with longer length of hospital stay (7.26 vs. 6.12 days, p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients with BHD represent a substantial subset of facial trauma patients that is characterized by different mechanisms of injury, injury patterns, and premorbid health status. BHD are associated with higher in-hospital complication rates and higher resource utilization.&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the relationship between craniofacial trauma and premorbid BHD creates opportunities for intervention that may decrease the morbidity and resource utilization of this group.&nbsp;

Ricci<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Montefiore Medical Center,Division Of Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery,Bronx, NEW YORK, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Facial trauma can be disfiguring and painful, with a wide spectrum of possible mechanisms and injury patterns. It can occur in patients of all ages and is associated with significant long-term morbidity and pain. Consequently, patients suffering craniofacial trauma are routinely prescribed opioid medication, and are at risk for opioid dependence. In this study, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) data was analyzed for trends in opioid prescription for the management of craniofacial trauma.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;NAMCS and NHAMCS data was extracted from the United States National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for the years 2006-2016. These databases capture annual samples of ambulatory visits made to hospital emergency departments (EDs) and non-federally employed, office-based physicians respectively. Craniomaxillofacial trauma, as identified by ICD codes, represented 7,997,454 visits in the United States over this time period. Trends in opioid and non-opioid prescription were studied, with variables of interest including demographics, geographic region, and expected source of payment.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;From 2006-2016, 1,209 observations were recorded in the combined NCHS dataset representing 7,997,454 visits. 58% of visits were male, and 42% were female. Patients aged 18-44 represented 46% of all visits for craniomaxillofacial trauma. Binomial logistic regression revealed multiple factors independently associated with increased odds of opioid prescription. Age 18-44 (OR 2.51, CI 1.28-4.94, p=0.01), black ethnicity (OR 1.67, CI 1.09-2.55, p = 0.02), private insurance (OR 2.27, CI 1.13-4.58, p=0.02), Medicaid (OR 2.65, CI 1.23-5.72, p=0.01), and self-pay (OR 3.31, CI 1.57-6.97, p=0.002) were all associated with increased opioid prescription. There was no significant difference in opioid prescription across geographical regions. Linear regression found no significant trend of visits over time where opioids were prescribed (coefficient: 0.0045, 95% CI: -0.003-0.012, p=0.24). Multiple linear regression of visits where opioids were prescribed, visit year, and age group similarly showed a non-significant trend of opioid prescription over time (p=0.214). From our analyses, there were comparable average rates of opioid and non-opioid prescription from 2006-2016 (13% of visits, range 6%-31% for opioids comparted to 12% of visits, range 6% -18% for non-opioids).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Craniofacial trauma is a common cause of presentation to ambulatory clinics and emergency rooms with opioid analgesics being utilized as an essential treatment modality for pain control. Despite increased awareness and emphasis on multimodal pain management, opioid prescription trends have remained relatively stable over time. Ages 18-44, black ethnicity, private insurance, Medicaid and self-pay were factors all associated with increased odds of opioid prescription.

It is well accepted that mesh reinforcement of ventral hernia repair (VHR) leads to lower postoperative hernia recurrence rates. The use of mesh, however, has been linked to higher mesh-related complications, specifically in regards to synthetic mesh implants. For these reasons, the use of synthetic mesh in contaminated fields has fallen out of favor.&nbsp; We aim to systematically assess the incidence of complications of synthetic mesh in VHR with a contaminated field.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A literature search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane identified all articles published between 2000 and 2020. Two independent reviewers evaluated all relevant articles and included articles that had a subgroup of VHRs in which synthetic mesh was used in a contaminated field. Outcomes data was extracted and categorized by mesh type: synthetic mesh (SM) and biologic mesh (BM). Mesh in the SM group included 100% synthetic nonabsorbable mesh, while the BM group included 100% biologic mesh, excluding biosynthetic meshes. Primary outcomes included hernia recurrence, surgical site occurrences (SSO), and surgical site infections (SSI). A random effects meta-analysis of proportion was used to calculate pooled complication rates. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated to compare the two cohorts.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our initial search resulted in 882 articles, which was narrowed to 104 after title and abstract review. After careful review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, in addition to cross referencing, 16 articles remained in our study. 5 studies reported SM and BM subgroups and were included in this analysis. Across studies, there were 535 SM patients and 232 BM patients. Pooled mean follow-up time was 40.4 months for SM and 43.9 months for BM. All patients were CDC Wound Class 2, 3, or 4 (41.3%, 45.5%, 13.2% for SM, and 57.4%, 38.1%, 4.5% for BM, respectively). Incidence of hernia recurrence was significantly lower for SM when compared to BM (p=0.009, Figure). Use of SM was not associated with increased formation of SSO or SSI in a contaminated field (p&gt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This analysis suggests lower rates of hernia recurrence in patients undergoing VHR with synthetic mesh in a contaminated field than in patients with biologic mesh. Based on these results, use of synthetic mesh should be wholly considered in pre-operative evaluation of contaminated VHR patients.

In low- and middle-income countries, burns are an increasing public health burden. Patients living far from urban centers are especially affected, as access to specialized burn care is limited or absent. In Rwanda, the University Teaching Hospital in Kigali (CHUK) is the largest national referral hospital and admits burn patients referred from all over the country. However, specific referral guidelines do not exist, thus it is unknown whether these patients needed transfer to a tertiary hospital or not. We aimed to compare burn patients referred to CHUK from the district hospitals (Pat-DH) with those referred from health care facilities within Kigali (Pat-K).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This retrospective study included all patients with burns admitted to the CHUK burn unit from 2005 to 2019. Data source was the burn unit ward logbooks. We compared characteristics and management of Pat-DH with Pat-K using Fisher&rsquo;s exact test or nonparametric tests for equality of medians.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Between 2005 and 2019, 1104 burn patients were admitted to CHUK, data were missing for 37 patients. Median age was 6.3 years (IQR 2.5 &ndash; 23.1) in Pat-DH and 2.7 years (IQR 1.6 &ndash; 7.4) in Pat-K, p&lt;0.05. Scalds were the dominant cause of injury in both groups. Flame burns were more common among Pat-DH than Pat-K (in 55% vs. 30% of the patients), p&lt;0.05. There was not a significant difference in burn size. Full thickness burns were present in 56% of Pat-DH and in 30% of Pat-K, p&lt;0.05. Pat-DH required surgical treatment more often than Pat-K (25% vs. 12%, p&lt;0.05). LOS was longer in Pat-DH than in Pat-K, 42 days (IQR 11-164) and 28 days (IQR 9-132), respectively, p&lt;0.05. Mortality in Pat-DH was 19% as compared with 10% of Pat-K, p&lt;0.001.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

When official guidelines are missing, there is risk that criteria adopted to refer patients to tertiary hospitals are arbitrary and inadequate. However, a third of patients with burns admitted at the CHUK were referred from district hospitals and their burns were more severe, their need of surgical intervention greater, and LOS longer as compared to patients from Kigali.

Though there are no clear guidelines, current referral patterns indicate that patients are being appropriately referred for specialized burn care in Kigali. However, the creation of referral criteria will be essential to reduce delay in reaching care and to avoid unnecessary transfer.

Kwan<sup>2</sup>, D. Jolly<sup>1</sup>, O. Ganor<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Children's Hospital Boston,Plastic Surgery,Boston, MA, USA <sup>2</sup>Brown University School Of Medicine,Plastic Surgery,Providence, RI, USA <sup>3</sup>Brown University School Of Medicine,Providence, RI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Gender-affirming chest surgery has been associated with increased quality of life and decreased levels of gender dysphoria in transmasculine patients, but limited research exists on physical health outcomes associated with these procedures. Previous research has suggested that pre-surgical chest dysphoria is associated with the avoidance of swimming, exercise, and other physical activity. This may be directly attributable to dysphoria but also reflect difficulty participating in activities when engaging in binding to reduce the visible appearance of the chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hypothesized that gender affirming chest reconstruction could therefore lead to increased physical activity, and that such an increase might be detectable through observed changes in patient body mass index (BMI) after the initial healing period.&nbsp;Our secondary hypothesis was that such changes were more likely to be seen for patients who initially presented with higher BMIs, as a proxy for those likely to be less active prior to surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective two-center chart review identified 118 transmasculine patients who underwent gender-affirming chest surgery between February 2016 and January 2019. Age at surgery, BMI within 1 month of surgery, and BMI within 8-18 months after surgery were collected. 65 patients were included in the final analysis, as the remainder of the patients did not have BMI data within the appropriate time frames.&nbsp;For the purpose of analysis, patients were grouped according to their BMI as &ldquo;normal weight&rdquo; (BMI 18-25) and &ldquo;overweight&rdquo; (BMI&gt;25).&nbsp;&nbsp;Paired t-tests were used to determine whether there were differences in peri-operative and post-operative BMI.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Individuals who started out at a BMI &lt;=25 saw no change in BMI from surgery in the post-operative period. However, on average, those who started out with a BMI of over 25 saw a small but significant decrease (p&lt;.03). The mean decrease in BMI was 1.5 (95% CI [0.04, 2.93]. A significant decrease in BMI was not seen when data for patients whose only post-operative BMI was measured at &lt;8 months was included in the study.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
These data suggests that, after the initial period of healing, chest surgery may help transmasculine individuals whose BMI falls into the overweight/obese range lose weight. Limitations of our study include a lack of consistent follow up and a relatively homogeneous population.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, these data suggest that BMI has substantial disadvantages when used as a marker for overall health and activity, and therefore future research is needed to more directly assess the effects of gender affirming chest surgery on both behavior and metabolic markers.

Given the limited understanding of the impact of virtual visits in plastic surgery, particularly in pre-operative care, the aim of this study was to understand patients&rsquo; and providers&rsquo; perceptions about the efficacy, value, accessibility and long-term viability of telemedicine in plastic surgery.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This study used a mixed-methods approach that included provider-level scheduling data collected through institution&rsquo;s management dashboards to quantify the shift towards telemedicine, and semi-structured phone interviews with patients and providers to elucidate their perspective on video visits. Ten plastic surgeons who had performed at least one video visit and 20 patients who had video visits with a plastic surgeon between April 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020 participated in semi-structured phone interviews. All interviews were analyzed using a multi-phase analysis approach leveraging rapid analytic procedures.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
One month prior to the pandemic, our plastic surgery clinic did not perform video visits. Following the stay-at-home order, 45.5% of post-operative visits and 21.4% of pre-operative visits were performed via video. The primary benefits of telemedicine identified by patients and providers were increased accessibility to care, decreased time spent traveling, and cost-savings related to fuel/transportation costs and time off from work. The primary limitations&nbsp;identified by providers were effective&nbsp;physical exams and building rapport virtually. Patients also acknowledged these limitations, however, were generally satisfied with their video visits and expressed trust that their surgeon would schedule an in-person visit if necessary. There was a marked diversity of provider opinions regarding the future of telemedicine in plastic surgery. Overall, patients and providers expressed willingness to participate in future video visits if clinically appropriate.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Despite the sudden shift to telemedicine in plastic surgery, our clinic was able to successfully accommodate and provide care to many pre- and post-operative patients. The findings of our study are consistent with prior studies describing video visits to be acceptable in many clinical settings but offer several new insights that may inform timely improvements in the virtual delivery of care in plastic surgery. Patients&rsquo; trust in the surgeon&rsquo;s judgment may help overcome skepticism related to the virtual exam and rapport-building. With increased patient education and standardized clinical guidelines for use of surgical telehealth, this technology has the potential to help facilitate and improve patient care in plastic surgery, although further investigation is required.

High-pressure irrigation with pulse lavage has similar outcomes to low-pressure irrigation in the acute traumatic population but has not been thoroughly analyzed in comorbid chronic wound patients.<sup>1</sup> We investigated outcomes following the change from pulsatile flow to gravity flow irrigation at our tertiary wound center.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A single-center retrospective review was performed on patients who underwent surgical debridement of a lower extremity wound from 2017 to 2019 and had documented follow up. Number of prior debridements was used to create a sample representative of the average chronic wound patient. Data were collected on demographics, comorbidities, and infectious complications.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;This study included 436 patients, 208 in the gravity flow group (47.7%) and 228 in the pulsatile flow group (52.3%). There were no differences in Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), body mass index, and hemoglobin A1c between the groups. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (n=257, 58.9%), peripheral vascular disease (n=227, 52.1%), and chronic kidney disease (n=55, 12.6%) with no differences between groups. Median wound area was 24 cm<sup>2</sup> (IQR 7.1-60 cm<sup>2</sup>) with no difference between groups (p=0.772). Patients in the gravity flow group underwent a median of 1 prior debridement (IQR 0-2) while patients in the pulsatile flow group underwent 0 prior debridements (IQR 0-1, p&lt;0.001). The incidence of prior positive cultures was similar between groups (gravity 84.8% versus pulsatile 85.2%, p=0.932). Infectious complications occurred more frequently in the gravity flow (n=22, 10.6%) versus pulsatile flow group (n=11, 4.8%). On bivariate logistic regression, patients undergoing debridement with gravity flow irrigation were found to have 2.3 times increased odds of developing an infectious complication (95% CI 1.10-4.93, p=0.027). When controlling for number of prior debridements and CCI, gravity flow irrigation remained independently associated with increased odds of infectious complications (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.01-4.64, p=0.047).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;In chronic wound patients, use of gravity flow irrigation leads to an increased risk of infectious complications. These findings are at odds with prior literature supporting non-inferiority of gravity flow irrigation in the acute traumatic population. The highly comorbid nature of the chronic wound population limits the generalizability of these prior studies. Studies specific to the chronic wound patient are critical to optimizing outcomes in this challenging population.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Foster<sup>1</sup>, E. Kim<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Francisco,Department Of Surgery,San Francisco, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The immediate placement of tissue expanders is a common first stage in post mastectomy breast reconstruction prior to implant based or autologous reconstruction. This interim time to final reconstruction may be complicated by seromas or infection, often requiring further imaging studies or interventions. The purpose of our study was to compare dual port tissue expanders, which have both an aspiration and expansion port, and single port expanders in terms of post-operative complications and further interventions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective review was performed of patients who underwent immediate tissue expander placement after mastectomy from March 2019 to March 2020. Delayed expander placement or autologous reconstruction with expanders were excluded. Demographics, intraoperative details, and post-operative course until final reconstruction were recorded. Complications included seroma, infection, hematoma, nipple or skin flap necrosis, and malposition of the expander. Further intervention included aspiration, ultrasound imaging, interventional radiology (IR) drainage placement, or return to operating room.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 128 dual port expander breast reconstructions were compared to 125 single port expander reconstructions over the same time period. Single port expanders were associated with slightly younger (p=0.022) and lower BMI (p=0.01) patients, with greater percentage of nipple sparing mastectomy (93% vs 82%, p=0.005) and greater subpectoral expander placement (86% vs 67%, p=0.001). There were no significant differences in key complications between these groups. Dual port expanders were associated with significantly decreased post operative ultrasound imaging (p=0.000). Mean time to IR drain placement in the dual port group was approximately 30 days after placement in single port (51.1 vs 21.4 days, p=0.013), despite no difference in IR drain placement (p=0.881). Up to 34% of dual port had at least one aspiration in clinic performed by Plastic Surgery, versus single port that required IR ultrasound-guided aspiration (p=0.000).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

There were no differences in key post-operative complications between the dual port and single port expander cohorts. However dual port expanders significantly reduced the need for post-operative ultrasound imaging, and delayed IR drain placement up to 30 days. The added convenience of clinic aspirations likely reduced costs related to utilization of resources from other departments.

Nguyen<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Francisco,Plastic Surgery/Surgery,San Francisco, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Injury recidivism is a major public health issue in the United States that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. This phenomenon has been previously investigated in regard to general trauma, burns, and other pathologies; the relationship of recidivism with facial fractures, however, has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study is to describe patients who repeatedly present with facial fractures, to elucidate the nature of these injuries, and to identify potential points of intervention and recidivism prevention.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a Level 1 Trauma Center patient registry, which is a database containing clinical information on all patients for whom the surgical trauma team was consulted in the emergency department upon patient arrival. Patients &ge; 18 years who were diagnosed with any type of facial fracture based on International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 code 802 between 2011-2016 were included. Recidivists were defined as patients with two or more unique&nbsp;presentations&nbsp;during the study period in which any facial fracture was diagnosed. Descriptive analyses were&nbsp;performed to compare the injury characteristics and hospital courses of the initial and repeat presentations among patients in the recidivism group.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among 2,204 patients with facial fractures, 39 patients (1.8%) presented multiple times with unique episodes of facial trauma during the study period. Recidivists were largely males (63%) of middle age (average 45 years, range 18-79) at initial presentation. The prevalence of homelessness was more than twice as high in the recidivism group compared to the overall cohort (25.6 vs. 12%, p&lt;0.0001). Time to repeat presentation ranged from 0 days to 4.8 years, with an average of 1.6 years between injuries. Preliminary analyses suggest higher injury severity sustained on second presentations compared to initial visits. Injury Severity Scores (ISS) were higher&nbsp;amongst a majority of patients (average increase 2.4 points, range -15-28), with 69% having repeat ISS greater than or equal to&nbsp;initial ISS. Hospitalizations for repeat injury were also associated with higher proportions of patients being admitted to ICU (43.6 vs. 30.8%), longer ICU stays (average 7.8 vs. 4.4 days), and longer overall lengths of stay (9.8 vs. 3.9 days) when compared to initial hospitalizations.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our results demonstrate that facial fracture recidivism was a rare occurrence amongst this cohort. Interestingly, patients who suffer multiple episodes of facial trauma might be at risk for higher injury severity on repeat presentation. Further analysis will be conducted to assess differences of this group compared to single-episode patients and to identify risk factors for recidivism.

Reports in the literature conflict on the reliability of pedicle extensions of vessels in free flap surgery. The objective of this study is to assess the outcomes of arteriovenous loops and vein pedicle extensions in free flap reconstruction through a systemic review of literature and the retrospective information from a tertiary hospital center. We will also discuss in detail the vein graft characteristics, flap indications, arteriovenous loop and interposition and patient comorbidities.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library was performed for relevant studies published up to January 2020. Study quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias assessment tool, and a set of 27 predetermined parameters was extracted by 2 investigators independently for further analysis. The parameters were combined with a retrospective analysis of patients requiring free flap reconstruction to the head and neck at a tertiary referral hospital between January 2007 and December 2018. All patients utilizing any vein graft, vein loops, arterial grafts and interposed free flaps were identified as a pedicle extension group. Data collection included medical, surgical, demographic and outcome variables. Relevant comparisons between the different reconstructions were made. The primary outcome measure was overall flap loss (total and partial).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;

The search yielded 1 randomized, 2 prospective and 37 retrospective studies totaling 1,103 patients identified over the study period as reconstruction involving pedicle extension. Overall, study quality was low and heterogeneity was large. Of the &nbsp;initial cases, 21 % were returned to the operating room for flap concerns. The free flaps most often used were radial forearm and gracilis. Approximately 65% of pedicle extensions were planned and the majority were performed in the initial operation 71%. Rates of post-operative complications of the pedicle extension group were consistent with or lower than those of free flap reconstructions without pedicle extension.



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Available evidence on the safety of pedicle lengthening is limited due to diversity in study conduct, patients included, and outcomes reported. Future publications concerning free flap reconstruction will benefit by a standardized reporting of surgical procedures and outcomes in terms of pedicle graft and length used. The series strongly suggests that pedicle extensions in the free flap setting are a practical and effective option for preventing complications in high risk complex and traumatic defects.

Globally, burn injuries are responsible for 250,000 deaths and 90% of this occurs in low and middle-income countries. In Subsaharan Africa, mortality is estimated to be 1 in every 5 burn patients. Baux score, Lethal Area 50 Index (LA50), and point of futility are calculated using the patient&rsquo;s age and TBSA to predict mortality risk from burns. They reflect the local standard of burn care and have been adjusted upwards in high-income countries (HICs) in the last decades. It remains to verify whether these tools are reliable in low-income settings

This study aimed to analyze in-hospital mortality and tools to predict the mortality risk among burn patients in Rwanda

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was a retrospective study done at the University Teaching Hospital in Kigali (CHUK), the largest referral hospital in Rwanda. Between 2005 and 2019, 1104 burn patients were admitted to the CHUK burn ward, Rwanda&rsquo;s only designated burn ward. In the present analysis we included 532 patients who had complete data regarding age, TBSA%, outcome, and their Baux score, LA50 and point of futility calculated. Data were collected from the ward logbook and analyzed using STATA v16.




<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

In the studied population; median age, TBSA% and Baux score were 3.4 years (IQR 1.9-17.1), 15% (IQR 11-25) and 23.5 (IQR 15.6-37.5), respectively. 13% of the patients died during the admission. LA50 was 46.9% TBSA (95% CI 41.2%-52.5%), Baux score 90 (94.6% CI 75.2-104.8) was significantly associated with death and the point of futility was 115.9 (IQR 94.6-137.2).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our study population consisted of young individuals with burns of moderate severity. However, the mortality was higher and&nbsp; the LA50 was lower and the Baux score higher as compared to data reported previously from HICs. Lack of complete data on both age and TBSA% for almost half of the patients was a limitation of this study. Furthermore, the in-hospital mortality may be underestimated as it does not include those patients who died after admission at the general ICU.

Baux score and LA50 are reliable and useful tools to verify the level of burn care even in low income settings. Systematic data collection is essential to develop accurate outcome prediction model in burn patients.

Good nutritional status is essential for proper wound healing. Postoperatively, free tissue transfer (FTT) patients are in a hypermetabolic state. Thus, optimizing nutritional status is critical to maximize flap success and healing. Historically, prealbumin and albumin have been utilized as easily obtained proxies for overall nutritional status, indicating acute and chronic changes, respectively. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these markers are correlated with healing time and overall flap healing after lower extremity (LE) FTT in the chronic wound population.

Methods

A retrospective review of LE chronic wound FTT patients treated by a single surgeon at our institution from 2011-2020 was performed. Inclusion criteria was defined as (1) albumin within 30 days prior to FTT, (2) prealbumin within 3 days prior to FTT, and (3) documented follow-up. Data collection included demographics, comorbidities, flap characteristics, and perioperative labs. The outcomes of interest were flap healing (FH) and time to flap healing (TFH). Patients were stratified according to perioperative nutritional markers, using initial thresholds of albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL and prealbumin &lt;10 mg/dL for poor nutritional status. Additional analysis at various thresholds for albumin and prealbumin was performed. Fisher&rsquo;s exact testing was used to assess overall healing rates and Mann-Whitney testing was used to assess association between perioperative nutritional markers and TFH.

Results

We identified 69 patients undergoing LE FTT for limb salvage with a mean age of 56.0 years (standard deviation [SD] 12.1). Mean&nbsp;Charlson&nbsp;Comorbidity Index was&nbsp;3.4 (SD&nbsp;2.1) and median follow up was 11.1 months. When using a threshold of &lt;3.5 g/dL for low albumin, no significance was found between FH or TFH and preoperative albumin, preoperative prealbumin, or postoperative albumin (Table 1). With low albumin defined as &lt;2.8 g/dL, TFH was significantly increased and FH was significantly decreased compared to the defined normal preoperative albumin group (Table 1). No significance was found between FH or TFH and preoperative prealbumin or postoperative albumin. An independent prealbumin threshold of &lt; 20 mg/dL did not cause significant change in outcomes.

Conclusion

Low preoperative albumin, when defined as &lt;3.5 g/dL, and prealbumin did not increase TFH. Contrarily, when defined as &lt;2.8 g/dL, low preoperative albumin significantly increased TFH and FH rates. The reliability of albumin and prealbumin as markers for nutritional status, however, has come into question. Further investigation into validated biomarkers and their thresholds is needed to assess the effect of nutritional status on wound healing and guide perioperative optimization.

Steinberg<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>MedStar Health Research Institute,Plastic/Podiatric Reconstructive Surgery,Washington, DC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Heel ulcers severely impact a patient&rsquo;s mobility, morbidity, and often lead to major lower extremity amputations. Diabetic ulcerations are the single highest independent risk factor for nontraumatic major lower extremity amputation (MLEA). Such amputations have been found to increase patient mortality between 20% and 50% at 3 years and 40% and 70% at 5 years. The Vertical Contour Calcanectomy (VCC) is a novel surgical procedure for the surgical management of these often recalcitrant and complex heel ulcerations which provides a technique to achieve consistent osseous and soft tissue reconstruction and reduce lower extremity amputations. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to report the long term outcomes of the VCC and provide guidance on the risks and benefits

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective search of available electronic medical records from January 2014 &ndash; 2019 was carried out at two institutions. Physician reviewers identified patients who underwent VCC, and reviewers collected data on demographics, medical history, and performed an analysis of procedure and outcome.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
51 total patients were identified meeting inclusion criteria, 38 with follow-up exceeding 1 year and 13 with MLEA or death within 1 year. The mean age was 64 (35-87) years. Mean body mass index was 30 (&plusmn;8.6) kg/m 2. The most common comorbidity was diabetes (n=44;&nbsp; 83.0%). 27.4% of the cohort experienced loss of limb at 1 year with the average time to amputation being 136+- 149 days. Thirty day and 1 year major outcomes following VCC are outlined in table 1. 30-day readmission, MLEA, and mortality were 14;(27.5%), 4;(7.8%), and 1(1.96%), respectively. In regards to lower extremity function, roughly half (n=14;51.9%) of the cohort had no observable change in function, n=8; 28.6% improved and n=5;18.5% declined.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This is the largest cohort of VCC patients reported on and the only study evaluating outcomes at 1 year. The duration of ulcer burden prior to VCC had a mean of 333 days &plusmn; 404, and has a major impact on quality of life. The VCC is an emerging technique and its effect on patient morbidity and mortality are promising.

Patel<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>University of Cambridge,School Of Clinical Medicine,Cambridge, CAMBRIDGESHIRE, United Kingdom <sup>2</sup>Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust,Department Of Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery,Exeter, DEVON, United Kingdom","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) is a well-established minimally invasive technique for release of Dupuytren&rsquo;s contracture. However, factors relating to surgeon preference and uncertainty regarding potential risks of digital nerve damage or flexor tendon rupture results in limited provision of PNF, in favour of open fasciectomy, which many surgeons consider to be the gold standard. Amongst its advantages, PNF requires minimal staffing and resources and additionally facilitates full function of the treated hand with immediate mobilisation in the post-operative period. The study aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PNF when delivered as the treatment of choice amongst 118 consecutive rays of varying Dupuytren&rsquo;s disease severity.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected for all patients who opted to receive PNF by a single surgeon between 2017-2020. Demographic data including age, comorbidities, smoking status and Dupuytren&rsquo;s diathesis were recorded. Patients were divided into 3 cohorts on the basis of joint contracture severity as per Tubiana staging (TS): 0-45&deg;, 46-90&deg;, 91-130&deg;. An analysis of the degree of release achieved from baseline was made across cohorts and compared with &chi;2 analysis. The incidence of post-operative complications including permanent or transient sensory disturbance, flexor tendon rupture, arterial transection or infection was assessed. Patient satisfaction and recurrence (&gt;20&deg; contracture in a single joint) were secondarily analysed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 118 rays were treated amongst 74 patients (mean age, 68 years (R,32-86), males: 74%) with mean follow-up 51 weeks (IQR 28-76 weeks). Patient cohorts were not significantly different at baseline. No cases of permanent sensory disturbance, flexor tendon rupture, arterial transection nor infection were observed. Neuropraxia was seen in 6 patients, resolving with mean recovery of 6 weeks. 86% (n=166) of joints had satisfactory release (residual passive extension deficit (PED) &le;10&deg;) with full release in 67%. Full release was most likely in MCPJ (93%) than DIPJ (67%) or PIPJ (45%) (p&lt;0.0001). Mean release was 54&deg; in MCPJ and 56&deg; in PIPJ. All TS1 patients achieved release with &le;10&deg; residual PED versus 75% of TS2 patients and 22% of TS3 patients (p&lt;0.05), the latter of whom had a mean residual PED of 12&deg;. Recurrence was observed in 19% of rays. 92% of patients stated they would undergo PNF again if necessary, in preference to open fasciectomy.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We find PNF to facilitate a safe, effective yet minimally invasive approach in patients of varying disease severity. Patients report high satisfaction in preference to undergoing open procedures. We conclude that this method offers a favourable alternative to open fasciectomy,&nbsp;as it consistently yields clinically acceptable contracture release, conserving full function of the hand in the immediate post-operative period.

Although it is reasonable to offer secondary IBR following first device removal, these patients are still at risk for subsequent infections which can lead to a repeat explantation. Whether further attempts of IBR should be pursued following two failed IBR is unknown. The goal of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of the third IBR following two failed attempts of IBR due to infection.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent a third IBR attempt following two sequential infected IBR explantation between 2008 and 2019. Our primary outcome measure was reconstructive failure. Secondary outcome measures included overall complications and infection.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 6093 IBR were performed between 2008 and 2019, out of whom 298 (5%) underwent first IBR removal due to infection and 116 underwent secondary IBR (24 of whom with LD). Out of 16 patients who had two failed IBRs due to infection, we identified 13 patients who attempted a third reconstruction while 3 patients did not pursue reconstruction. The mean age of the third reconstruction group was 53&plusmn;6 years and mean BMI was 29&plusmn;8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Six patients (46%) received previous radiotherapy. In total, 7 patients (54%) underwent reconstruction with a permanent implant, 2 (15%) received a tissue expander (TE), 2 (15%) received TE followed by an implant, and 2 (15%) had a free flap. The mean follow-up was 43 &plusmn; 29 months.

&nbsp;

Overall complication rate was 31% (n=4). Infection developed in 3 IBR patients (23%), 2 of whom ultimately had their device removed. One patient with a free flap developed flap venous thrombosis which was salvaged during an operative take-back. Overall, 11 (85%) had successful tertiary reconstruction.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In patients who had failed secondary IBR due to infection, a third breast reconstruction should be considered. However, this is associated with high infection and failure rates. This information would help in patients&rsquo; counseling and decision making.

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) has a significantly higher rate of post-operative complications in elderly patients compared to younger patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether robotic assistance mitigates the risks of complications in patients &ge;&nbsp;75 years old undergoing PD.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The 2015-2018 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database was queried to identify patients &ge;75 years of age who underwent open or robotic assisted (RA) PD. The cohorts were matched 1:1 using propensity score matching for patient characteristics and risk factors for pancreatic fistula to assess the 30-day outcomes of interest: perioperative complications, duration of hospital stay, discharge destination, reoperations, and readmissions. Patients hospitalized &gt;14 days were excluded from the readmission analysis to avoid immortal time bias. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to predict differences in outcomes.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 3,079 patients were identified of which 138 underwent RAPD. A propensity-score matched sample of 274 total cases (136 open PD and 138 RAPD) was analyzed. Baseline demographics/patient characteristics were similar between the two cohorts except for race/ethnicity where the RAPD cohort had less non-white patients (12.3% vs. 29.4%, p=0.003). On univariate analysis, RAPD was associated with a lower rate of pancreatic fistula (11.6% vs 22.3%, p&lt;0.001), delayed gastric emptying (26.1% vs 35.4%, p=0.001), superficial infection (3.6% vs 10.3%, p=0.030), organ/space surgical site infection (SSI) (13.8% vs 34.6%, p&lt;0.001), and sepsis (5.8% vs 21.3%, p&lt;0.001). Duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter in the RAPD cohort with a median of 8 days vs 15 days for the open PD cohort (p&lt;0.001), and patients in the RAPD cohort were more likely to be discharged home (76.1% vs 56.6%, p=0.001). However, readmissions were increased with RAPD compared to open PD (28.2% vs 8.1%, p&lt;0.001). Reoperations were similar between the cohorts (12.3% vs 14.0%, p=0.686). On multivariate analysis, the RAPD cohort showed decreased odds of developing fistula, delayed gastric emptying, bleeding/transfusions, deep organ space SSI, sepsis, and septic shock.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
RAPD in patients &ge;75 years of age appears to be safe and is associated with decreased duration of hospitalization and more patients discharged to home compared to open PD. The complication profile is similar in many regards, but RAPD was associated with decreased fistula rate, delayed gastric emptying, and infectious complications.

Pawlik<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Ohio State University,Surgery,Columbus, OH, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Michigan,National Clinician Scholars Program At The Institute For Healthcare Policy And Innovation,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;The use of robotic total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) has become increasingly more prevalent. Proponents of rTKA tout its potential to not only improve outcomes, but also reduce costs compared with traditional total knee arthroplasty (tTKA). Despite its potential to deliver on the value proposition, whether rTKA has led to improved outcomes and cost savings within Medicare&rsquo;s Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative remains unexplored.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Medicare beneficiaries who underwent TKA designated under Medicare severity diagnosis related group (MS-DRG) 469 or 470 in 2017 were identified using the 100% Medicare Inpatient Standard Analytic Files; hospitals participating in BPCI were identified using the BPCI analytic file. We calculated risk-adjusted, price-standardized payments for the surgical episode from admission through 90 days post discharge. Outcomes, utilization, and spending were assessed relative to variation between robotic and traditional TKA.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Overall, 194,020 patients underwent TKA (tTKA: n=189,669, 97.8% vs. rTKA: n=4,351, 2.2%); among the 3,200 hospitals that performed TKA, only 300 (9.3%) performed rTKA; among the 213 participating in BPCI, only 40 (19%) hospitals performed rTKA. Risk-adjusted 90-day episode spending was $14,264 (95% CI: $14,233 to $14,295) among patients who underwent tTKA versus $13,600 (95%CI: $13,404 to $13,796) among patients who had rTKA. Patients who underwent rTKA had a shorter length-of-stay (tTKA: 2.3 days, 95%CI: 2.2-2.3 vs. rTKA: 1.9 days, 95%CI: 1.9-2.0), as well as a lower incidence of complications (tTKA: 3.3%, 95%CI: 3.2-3.3 vs. rTKA: 2.5%, 95%CI: 2.2-3.0). Of note, patients who underwent rTKA were less often discharged to a post-acute care facility than patients who underwent tTKA (tTKA: 22.5%, 95%CI: 22.4-22.7 vs. rTKA: 15.6%, 95%CI 14.6-16.7). Of note, average hospital spending decreased as rTKA utilization reached and surpassed 50% of total TKA operative volume among both BPCI and non-BPCI hospitals (Figure).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Overall 90-day episode spending for rTKA was lower than tTKA (D-$664, 95%CI: $466-$862). The decrease in spending was attributable to shorter length-of-stay, fewer complications, as well as lower utilization of postacute care facility. The cost-savings associated with rTKA was only realized when rTKA volume surpassed 50% of total TKA volume, reflecting a need to overcome fixed initial costs. Hospitals participating in BPCI may experience cost-saving with increased utilization of rTKA.&nbsp;

Perugini<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Massachusetts Medical School,Surgery,Worcester, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Paraconduit hiatal hernia (PCHH) is an understudied complication of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) with significant morbidity. PCCH incidence ranges up to 6% for open techniques and 20% with minimally invasive approaches, and may be increasing with improved survival with the advent of adjuvant chemoradiotherapies. Commonly proposed risks include neoadjuvant therapy, transhiatal surgical approach, female sex, tumor location, and minimally invasive technique. There is limited consensus and continued debate on the surveillance and management of hiatal hernias following minimally invasive esophagectomies.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We retrospectively reviewed records of patients who underwent esophagectomy at an academic tertiary care center between 2013-2019. We divided the cohort into those who did and did not develop PCHH, identifying differences in demographics, perioperative characteristics/factors, and outcomes. In patients who developed PCHH, we further evaluated the hernia characteristics and repair outcomes.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In 49 patients who underwent esophagectomy, six (12.2%) developed PCHH at a median of 160 days (60-350 days) postoperatively. They were younger (57 vs 65 years, p=0.006), and in cases of resection for cancer, more likely to develop tumor recurrence (83% vs 21%, p=0.005) at a median of 287 days. There was no significant difference in two-year cancer-free survival (PCHH 33% vs no hernia 63%, p=0.20) or five-year overall survival between the two groups (PCHH 67% vs no hernia 69%, p=0.87). Five PCHH were symptomatic, of which four were addressed laparoscopically. Three of four PCHH repairs were without mesh and recurred at 186, 242, and 588 days. One of the three PCHH recurrences required more than one attempt at repair. One repair utilized biosynthetic mesh in a pledgetted sublay fashion and is intact 560 days postoperatively.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
PCHH is a common occurrence following MIE. We found paraconduit hernias to be associated with younger age and tumor recurrence, without&nbsp;change in two-year cancer-free survival or five-year overall survival. PCHH likely does not confer additional mortality. Repair in symptomatic patients may be accomplished laparoscopically. Mesh reinforcement should be considered to minimize the high risk of recurrence. Further long-term studies are needed to address modifiable risk factors and identify optimal techniques for durable repair of post esophagectomy PCHH.

There is a dearth of literature on the long-term effectiveness and safety of bariatric surgery in&nbsp;septuagenarian&nbsp;patients.&nbsp;The aim of this study was to compare the short and long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery in this population.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;After obtaining institutional review board approval, patients who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) at our institution between 2011 and 2015 were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into two age groups: &lt;70 years and &ge;70 years. Their baseline demographic characteristics were collected. Outcomes including postoperative hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day reinterventions, 30-day readmissions, 90-day mortality, and mean percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) at 4 years were recorded and compared between the study groups. Reinterventions included both reoperations as well as endoscopic interventions. The comparisons were performed with ANOVA and multivariate binary and linear logistic regressions controlling for gender, preoperative BMI, and type of procedure using SPSS statistical software, Version 26.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Twenty-nine septuagenarians were included and underwent 21 LRYGB (72.4%) and 8 LSG (27.6%). The mean follow-up was 2.5 &plusmn; 1.5 years, while thirteen patients had a 4-year follow-up. When compared with 1011&nbsp;patients aged &lt;70 years operated on during the same time period, the septuagenarians demonstrated lower preoperative BMI (p=0.001). Patient baseline characteristics can be found in Table 1. When we controlled for gender, preoperative BMI, and type of procedure the septuagenarians had higher LOS (3 vs 2.3 days, p=0.01) and 4-year reinterventions (38% vs 23%, p=0.015), but similar 4-year %EWL (55.1% vs 51.2%, p=0.633), and 30-day reinterventions (10% vs 6%, p=0.316). 90-day mortality was observed only in one patient in the control group.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Bariatric surgery in carefully selected septuagenarians can be accomplished with acceptable safety and comparable postoperative weight loss at 4 years. Surgeons may consider broadening their selection criteria to include this patient subgroup.

O'Grady<sup>1</sup>, L. Morris-Wiseman<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Arizona,Department Of Surgery,Tucson, AZ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Prior studies on laparoscopic cholecystectomy have concluded that resident involvement lengthens operative time but does not impact outcomes. Previously-described similarities&nbsp;in operative times per case across post-graduate year (PGY) resident levels have not been clearly explained. We hypothesized that attending-specific average operative time for laparoscopic cholecystectomy was more predictive than resident PGY level.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We retrospectively analyzed laparoscopic cholecystectomy cases between November 2018-March 2020. Surgeons who performed &gt;10 laparoscopic cholecystectomies over the study period were included. Residents were grouped by junior (PGY1-3) and senior residents/fellows (PGY4-7). Primary outcome measures evaluated included operative time, as well as the occurence of any complication. Any adverse event directly related to the operation,&nbsp;including patient return to emergency department after discharge, was considered a complicaton for the purposes of this analysis. Patient and operative factors related to cases that included junior or senior residents were compared using Chi-squared, Fisher&rsquo;s Exact test, or t-tests. ANOVA was used performed to evaluate the relative influence on operative time of attending and resident level.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;296 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed by 12 surgeons in the study period were analyzed.&nbsp; Comparing cases performed with junior residents (n=113) and senior residents/fellows (n=183), there were no differences in patient age (43.2+16.2 vs. 41.9+16.6, p=0.51), gender (p=0.15), body mass index (BMI, 32.4 vs. 34.2, p=0.13), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Classification (p=0.16), or presence of any major co-morbidity (p=0.92). Total operative time was significantly shorter in operations with junior residents compared to senior residents (82.5+37.4 min vs. 92.9+42.5 min, p = 0.034).&nbsp; Intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) was performed in 12.5% of cases (n=37), and demonstrated no impact on operative time.&nbsp; There were no significant differences between groups in terms of complication rates (8.7% versus 10.7%, p=0.624) or conversion to an open procedure (1.9% vs. 2.9%, p=1.0). An ANOVA analysis demonstrated that both the attending surgeon and the resident level had a significant influence on operating time; the attending influence on operating time was more pronounced (F-statistic 20.52, p&lt;0.0001) than the resident influence (F-statistic 5.02, p=0.026).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Operative time for laparoscopic cholecystectomy was significantly higher in cases involving senior residents with no difference in patient factors, conversion to open operation, or complication rate. Attending influence on operative time was more pronounced than resident level influence. These results suggest that the specific attending surgeon is a more important determinant of operative time than resident level or performance of an intraoperative cholangiogram, although resident level does have an effect.

However, the clinical characteristics and treatment of hyperkinetic biliary dyskinesia has not been well defined. The aim of this study was to assess whether laparoscopic cholecystectomy improves symptoms of patients with hyperkinetic biliary dyskinesia postoperatively.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;With IRB approval, records of patients 18 years and older with GBEF &gt;80% who&nbsp;underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy by two surgeons at a tertiary care center between 2012-2020 were retrospectively reviewed.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world. The standard of care for the surgical point of view is either resection or transplant which is associated with significant morbidity and high costs. The role of loco-regional treatments has become an available alternative. MWA offers a focused and efficient energy source, hence a predictable zone of ablation (Fig.1). We report 66 patients with HCC treated with laparoscopic, ultrasound-guided MWA.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We performed a retrospective chart review of 66 patients treated with laparoscopic microwave liver tumor ablation from 2013-2019. All patients with either imaging or biopsy-proven HCC were included in the study. Patient demographics, average tumor size, number of MWAs, operating room (OR) time, length of stay (LOS), complications, mortality and tumor recurrence were recorded.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 83 MWA were performed on 66 patients, with 80.3% patients treated with a single ablation. The mean age of the patients was 72.5 years, M: F ratio 2:1 and the average tumor size was 5.1cm. No blood transfusions were required in any patient. The average OR time was 110 min. The mean HCC-MELD score was 32 (HCC+MELD-Na). The average LOS was 2.5 days. There were post-operative complications in 7.6% (n=5) of the patients. The mortality rate was 1.5% (n=1). There was recurrence in 19.7% (n=13) of the patients with an average time of 22 months. After recurrence or new primary tumors, patients were treated with a second MWA or Y-90 radioembolization

Conclusion

This report is the largest series compiled to date. Laparoscopic ultrasound-guided MWA is a safe technique with minimal morbidity and mortality; effective for the treatment of cirrhosis associated HCC. This data supports the use of MWA as a viable alternative to resection and transplantation. We recommend increased surgical participation in minimally invasive liver ablation for treatment of HCC.&nbsp;

To evaluate YAG capsulotomy rates following implantation of two types of trifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Eyes which either had an AT Lisa Tri or Alcon PanOptix IOL implant were included. The primary outcome measure was Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy. The rate of laser capsulotomy between the groups was compared using Chi-Squared test. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 was taken as statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 328 eligible eyes were identified. Nine eyes were excluded due to incorrect procedure code or missing files. Out of the 319 eyes of 177 patients included in this study, 180 received AT Lisa Tri while 139 of them received Alcon PanOptix Trifocal IOLs.

The mean (SD) age of the patients was 52.29 years (&plusmn;11.04). Gender was equally distributed with 91 male patients (51.4%). Median (IQR) time to laser capsulotomy was 8 months (3-16). Clinically posterior capsular opacification (PCO) was present in 75 eyes (23.5%). A total of 39 eyes (12.2%) underwent Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy. Among the AT Lisa Tri group 29 eyes (16.1%) underwent laser capsulotomy compared to 10 (7.2%) (n=10) in Alcon PanOptix group (p=0.016).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this study cohort, eyes implanted with AT Lisa Tri showed a significantly increased rate of YAG capsulotomy. A prospective randomized control trial is recommended to confirm these findings.

DuBose<sup>1</sup>, T. M. Scalea<sup>1</sup>, J. J. Morrison<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Maryland,Surgery,Baltimore, MD, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Endovascular techniques for the treatment of non-traumatic iliac disease are often considered first line therapies that are both durable and lower risk than operative intervention. The role of these techniques in traumatic lesions is unclear but has potential benefits. The aim of this study is to use a national registry to compare outcomes for open versus endovascular management of traumatic iliac injuries.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Trauma Data Bank was searched for all adult patients from 2002-2016 with iliac arterial injury as identified by either Abbreviated Injury Scale or International Classification of Disease scores. Patients were excluded who were transferred between hospitals, declared dead prior to the operating room, had a non-survivable head injury, traumatic amputation, multiple arterial injuries or were treated using open and endovascular techniques. Patients were considered by method of repair (open or endo) and mechanism (blunt or penetrating) and matched based on mangled extremity score variables: age, hypotension and time until operative repair. Using unpaired Student&rsquo;s t-test and a p value of 0.05, comparison was made between 30-day rates of amputation in the groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Overall, 2856 iliac injuries were identified: 1892 (66%) blunt and 964 (34%) penetrating injuries. In the blunt group, 342 (18%) had open surgery and 1550 (82%) underwent endovascular repair. Post-matching, 335 patients were matched in each group. Despite a higher proportion of chest, abdomen and extremity injuries in the endo group, and well-matched physiology and time to the operating room between the groups, endo repair was associated with a significantly lower rate of amputation than open repair (0.6% vs. 3.6%, p=0.015). A higher rate of venous injury was noted in the open versus endo group (13.7% vs. 1.8%, p&lt;0.001).

Within the penetrating injury group, 755 (78%) had open and 209 (22%) had endo repair. Post-matching, 198 patients were matched per group, with endo patients having a higher rate of fracture and extremity injury, but open patients sustaining more venous injury (48.5% vs. 37.4%, p=0.03). Endo repair was associated with a lower rate of amputation than open repair (0% vs. 5.1%, p=0.004).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Endovascular repair of iliac arterial injury was associated with a significantly lower rate of amputation than open surgery regardless of mechanism. However, open repair was also associated with traumatic venous injury and it is unknown whether this represents a data collection phenomenon (ie: observed at surgery, but not at angiography) or a real clinical entity. Further work is required to delineate the benefit of endovascular intervention and the role of iliac vein injury in limb salvage.

Drew University of Medicine and Science,College Of Medicine,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  There has been increased public awareness of the role of tourniquets for extremity hemorrhage control due to national efforts such as the Stop the Bleed campaign. Although much of the focus has been placed on traumatic bleeding, hemorrhage from vascular access (AV fistula and graft) is an uncommon yet potentially fatal complication for which the optimal method of bleeding control has yet to be defined. We aim to&nbsp;To describe the use of tourniquets and examine their effect on outcomes in patients with vascular access hemorrhage.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a 5-year retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients presenting to our Level 1 trauma center with vascular access bleeding. Variables analyzed were demographics, type and location of access, admission vital signs, method of hemorrhage control, transfusion requirements, loss of access, complications, and mortality. Patients who had tourniquets placed were compared to those who did not.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 91 patients, the mean age was 65 years old and hemorrhage occurred outside of the dialysis center in 71%. Tourniquets were placed in 34 (37%), of which 62% were successful in controlling bleeding. In 50 patients (55%), non-medical personnel were responsible for initial attempts at bleeding control. 26 (29%) presented in shock and 17 (19%) received blood products in the emergency room. Mortality was 3%, and loss of access occurred in 23%. There was no difference between the tourniquet and non-tourniquet groups with respect to the presence of shock, need for transfusion, mortality, or loss of access (p=NS).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Vascular access hemorrhage occurs more commonly in non-healthcare settings and, in the majority of cases, initial attempts at bleeding control are dependent on non-medical personnel. Although mortality is low, nearly &frac14; end up losing their access site. Further studies are required to determine the effectiveness and safety of routine tourniquet use for patients with vascular access bleeding complications.

Ang<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University of Central Florida,General Surgery,Ocala, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Hip fractures are one of the most common traumatic injuries in the United States, secondary to an aging population. Multiple co-morbidities are found in patients who present to Trauma Centers (TC) with isolated hip fracture (IHF) including significant cardiac disease. Aortic stenosis (AS) among these patients has been recently shown to increase mortality. However, factors leading to death from aortic stenosis are unknown. We hypothesize that pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) is a significant mechanism of death among IHF patients with AS.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a multi-center retrospective cohort study examining IHF patients treated at Level I and II TC within a large hospital system from 2015-2019. Patients who had IHF and AS were compared to those who had IHF, AS, and PHTN. Multivariable logistic regression was used to risk adjust by age, race, insurance status, and other comorbidities. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. The secondary outcomes were hospital acquired complications.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1,388 IHF patients with AS were included in the study. Eleven percent of these patients also had PHTN. The crude mortality rate was higher if IHF patients had both AS and PHTN compared to IHF with AS alone, 9% vs. 3.7%, p-value 0.003. After risk adjustment, higher risk of mortality was still significant aOR 2.56 (95% CI 1.28, 5.11). In addition, IHF patients with both AS and PHTN had higher complication rates; specifically, cerebrovascular accident (2.8% vs 0.6% p-value 0.01), acute kidney injury (31.0% vs 21.9%, p-value 0.01), and hemorrhagic shock (2.1% vs 0.4%, p-value 0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: PHTN among IHF with AS increases the likelihood of inpatient mortality by 2.5 times. This is an important mechanism of death to identify because it will alter the peri-operative management in a significant subset of these patients.

Diagnosis remains challenging.&nbsp;We sought to evaluate the demographics, imaging findings, and outcomes of BBMI patients who had a CT abdomen/pelvis (CT/AP) at admission.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We queried the trauma registry at an ACS Level 1 suburban trauma center for adults (&ge;18 years) admitted from 1/2009 to 12/2019 who had injury&nbsp;to the small bowel, colon, and/or mesentery after blunt trauma. Patients without admission CT&nbsp;and&nbsp;ED deaths were excluded. Chart review was conducted on BBMI patients and controls matched for age, sex, year of injury, and mechanism of injury.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

During the study period, 73 patients&nbsp;of 14,452 blunt trauma admissions&nbsp;met all&nbsp;criteria.&nbsp; Median patient age was 45 (IQR 26,56) and 61.6% were male. The most common MOI was MVC (52, 71%). The&nbsp;median Injury Severity Score was 25 (IQR 14,36) and median hospital stay was 15 days (IQR 8,29). Nine&nbsp;patients died: 7 had&nbsp;complications of intraperitoneal injury including hemorrhage, fecal peritonitis, or sepsis, 1 with TBI, and 1 with thoracic aortic injury.

Abnormal CT findings (Table 1) were recorded&nbsp;in 97%&mdash;CT&nbsp;alone was 91% sensitive and 91% specific for detecting BBMI confirmed on operation or with serial scans. 27 BBMI patients had 1 of the below CT findings, 31 had 2, 11 had 3, and 4 had 4. The most common concomitant&nbsp;findings were bowel wall pathology with hemoperitoneum/hematoma (14 cases). Non-operative patients were more likely to have only one finding (10/15)&nbsp;than operatively-managed patients (17/58).

Of&nbsp;73 BBMI patients, 15 were managed non-operatively. Of the 58 patients who had laparotomy, 48 BBMI were identified and operated on shortly after imaging.&nbsp; There were&nbsp;2 non-therapeutic laparotomies. Six&nbsp;patients had&nbsp;surgery at 20 hours to 8 days later. The PPV (therapeutic laparotomy/all laparotomies)&nbsp;of laparotomy was&nbsp;96% but&nbsp;the NPV (non-op management/(successful non-op+failed non-op) for&nbsp;non-operative management&nbsp;was 71%.

Of the 147 control patients, one had diaphragm rupture, one had&nbsp;bladder rupture, 5 had splenic laceration grades I-III, 4 had liver laceration grades I-III, and 2 had pancreatic contusion. 3 had ex-lap.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

BBMI occur infrequently.&nbsp; The highest sensitivity CT finding is the presence of hemoperitoneum&nbsp;(74%).&nbsp; However, pneumoperitoneum has the greatest specificity (100%). To avoid delays of care, a high level of clinical suspicion in patients with mechanism and/or&nbsp;radiologic findings is necessary to optimize the care of BBMI patients.&nbsp; &nbsp;

The aim was to evaluate post-operative hypothermia, intra-abdominal hemorrhage (IAH), and abdominal fungal infection (AFI) in patients undergoing DCS with and without DPR.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This was a retrospective review of patients receiving DPR following initial DCS from 1/2016 to 7/2019 at a Level I trauma center. &nbsp;Demographic, clinical, and operative characteristics were collected.&nbsp; Outcomes evaluated included post-operative hypothermia, IAH, AFI, hospital length of stay (LOS), primary fascial closure (PFC), and in-hospital mortality (IM), and were compared&nbsp;against patients who&nbsp;did not receive DPR. Univariate and multivariate analysis&nbsp;was performed with a priori significance at p &le; 0.05. Similar analyses were conducted for those undergoing DCS with and without DPR in the setting of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) or involvement of large bowel from injury or perforation (LB).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 139 patients were included in the study; 39 underwent DPR (33 EGS, 6 Trauma) and 100 underwent DCS with conventional resuscitation (64 EGS, 36 Trauma). Baseline characteristics and injury severity were&nbsp;similar among both groups. While post- operative hypothermia, IM, AFI, and LOS were also similar, DPR was associated with decreased IAH (OR 0.34 ,95% CI [0.12,0.96], p=0.049). When the analysis was restricted to those presenting with ACS (n=26), DPR was not associated with an increased risk of IAH or AFI but did have lower incidence of PFC (OR 0.11, 95% CI [0.017,0.74], p=0.041). For those presenting with LB (n=62), DPR was associated with increased AFI (OR 5.8, 95% CI [1.2, 28], p=0.03) but not IAH (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In our study, while DPR in the setting of DCS reduced the risk of IAH, it may be associated with increased AFI in LB.&nbsp; Further prospective and large-scale studies are needed to better elucidate these observed trends.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Retrospective review of all trauma patients admitted to our Level 1, academic trauma center from 1/2018 - 1/2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given we are not an accredited pediatric trauma center, we excluded patients &lt; 18 years of age.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, all direct admit patients were excluded given this was an analysis of ED dwell time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic demographics were obtained and trauma activation criteria (based on ACS recommendations) for our institution was followed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary outcome included total ED dwell time for trauma activation patients versus non-activations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary outcomes included association with hospital complications, specifically mortality and readmission rates, between trauma activation and non-activation patients based on ACS metrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chi-square was used for categorical data and statistical significance was set at&nbsp;p&lt;0.05.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:4924 patients were included.&nbsp;&nbsp;2821 (57.3%) activations and 2103 (42.7%) non-activations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Demographics breakdown can be seen in the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean ED dwell time for trauma activation patients was 2 hours 51 minutes (&plusmn;2 hours 2 minutes) compared to 5 hours 26 minutes (&plusmn;2 hours 41 minutes) for non-activation trauma patients (p&lt;0.001).&nbsp;&nbsp;Trauma activations (and therefore less ED dwell time) were associated with less overall hospital complications (20.1% vs 32.3%;&nbsp;p&lt;0.001).&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortality rates for trauma activations were higher (5.7% vs 1.3%;&nbsp;p&lt;0.001).&nbsp;&nbsp;However, readmission rates were lower for trauma activation patients (3.2% vs 30%;&nbsp;p&lt;0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Trauma patients presenting as activations not only have significantly shorter ED dwell times by approximately 2.5 hours but also experience decreased hospital complications and lower readmission rates when compared to non-activated trauma patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the acuity of activated trauma patients, one would expect the mortality to be higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasis should be placed on moving trauma patients through the ED as quickly as possible to avoid unwanted outcomes. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

Little is known about the clinical factors and outcomes associated with SUB. Our objective was to determine predictive factors and outcomes of SUB as compared to TOT.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We retrospectively reviewed the clinical factors and outcomes for patients who were admitted from our ED to the acute care service (ACS) and underwent SUB or TOT by an ACS surgeon for acute biliary disease (2017-2020). Wilcoxon rank sum and Fisher&rsquo;s exact tests were used for continuous and categorical data, respectively.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;450 patients underwent cholecystectomy; 19 (4.2%) were SUB. The 19 SUB and 170 randomly selected TOT patients were then reviewed. SUB patients were more likely to be male (57.9% v 25.9%; p=0.006), present to the ED with a longer duration of pain (3d v 1.5d, p=0.041), have a positive Murphy&rsquo;s sign on exam (68.4% v 31.2%; p=0.002), have greater leukocytosis (14.0 v 10.8; p=0.043), receive pre-operative antibiotics (100% v 74.7%; p=0.008) and have a higher Tokyo Grade (2 v 1; p&lt;0.001). Operative findings associated with SUB included perforated gallbladder on first visualization (15.8% v 0.6%; p=0.003), gallbladder decompression at the beginning of dissection (84.2% v 13.5%; p&lt;0.001), inability to achieve the CVS (89.5% v 1.2%; p&lt;0.001), higher blood loss (50mL v 25mL; p=0.009) and intraoperative drain placement (100% v 12.9%; p&lt;0.001). SUB patients had an increased length of stay (4d v 3d; p&lt;0.001), more 1-year readmissions related to their procedure (37.5% v 3.5%; p&lt;0.001) and more often underwent post-discharge ERCP (31.6% v 4.1%; p&lt;0.001). No major biliary tree or vascular injuries occurred in either group.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;SUB is more often performed in patients presenting with greater severity of illness based on both preoperative and intraoperative factors. While there were no biliary or vascular injuries, suggesting that SUB may represent a safe alternative when the CVS cannot be achieved, SUB patients do have a more complicated postoperative&nbsp;course. More studies examining the indications for and outcomes of SUB are needed.

Pieracci<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>University of Colorado-Denver,Surgery,Aurora, CO, USA <sup>2</sup>Denver Health Medical Center,Surgery,Denver, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Previous studies suggest that surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) should be performed within 48 hours of injury. However, these data may be confounded by the fact that patients who require additional urgent procedures (AUP) experience delay to SSRF. The objective of this study was to characterize the prevalence and order of AUPs among patients who undergo SSRF. We hypothesized that AUPs occur before SSRF and increase time to SSRF.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This is a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database from an urban, Level-1 trauma center (2010-2020). Patients who underwent isolated SSRF were compared to those who underwent SSRF plus &ge; 1 AUP. AUP was defined as any operative or endovascular procedure &le; 5 days from injury.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Overall, 202 patients underwent SSRF. The average age was 53 years, the majority (72%) were male, with an average injury severity score of 21. There were 68 patients (34%) who required &ge;1 AUP; 62% underwent one AUP, 26% underwent two AUPs, and 12% underwent &ge;3 AUPs. The most common AUPs were long bone operations (40%), pelvic fixation (28%), and exploratory laparotomy (26%). Compared to patients who underwent SSRF alone, AUP patients were more severely injured (median injury severity score 26 versus 17, p&lt;0.01) and more commonly presented after high mechanism blunt trauma. AUP patients also incurred worse outcomes, including longer hospital length of stay (13 versus 8 days, p&lt;0.01), higher rates of mechanical ventilation (72% versus 23%, p&lt;0.01), and higher tracheostomy rates (72% versus 23%, p&lt;0.01).&nbsp; &nbsp;Among AUP patients, 56% underwent SSRF before the first AUP, 12% simultaneously with AUP, and 32% after the first AUP. Patients who required AUPs underwent SSRF significantly later than patients with no AUPs (hospital day 1.5 versus 0, p&lt;0.01). The greatest delay to SSRF was in spine surgery patients (Figure). Subgroup analysis of AUP patients demonstrated that delay to SSRF was more pronounced patients who underwent SSRF after AUP (n=38) versus prior to AUP (n=22)(2 versus 1 day delay, p=0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The occurrence of &ge; 1 AUP was associated with both increased injury severity and delayed SSRF. Future studies addressing timing of SSRF should stratify by AUPs, as they likely confound the perceived benefit of early repair.

Loomis<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Mayo Clinic,Rochester, MN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Optimizing volume status is essential to ICU management and patient outcomes. Ultrasound (US) of the inferior vena cava (IVC) reliably assesses intravascular volume status; however, results are affected by provider technique, body habitus, and surgical dressings. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) prevents and reverses atelectasis. Human and animal studies have shown that elevated PEEP can lead to hemodynamic changes, particularly in hypovolemic subjects. The transient decrease in systolic blood pressure identified in hypovolemic patients during recruitment maneuver appears to be a simple, non-invasive measure of intravascular volume status.&nbsp;&nbsp; This pilot study was performed to validate the use of recruitment maneuvers to assess volume status.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Single institution prospective study of mechanically ventilated, hemodynamically unstable patients admitted to a surgical/trauma intensive care unit from December 2015 to March 2019. Consent for the study was obtained from a power of attorney or next of kin. IVC US and recruitment maneuvers were performed concurrently pre-resuscitation and post-resuscitation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Resuscitation status was determined by treating team.&nbsp; IVC measurements were performed in triplicate; mean distensibility index [dIVC = (IVCmax &ndash; IVCmin)/IVCmin x 100] was calculated with dIVC &gt; 18% the cutoff for defined hypovolemia. Recruitment maneuvers were performed by increasing PEEP to 30 for 30 seconds. Systolic blood pressure decrease to &lt;90mmHg or decrease by &ge; 40 mmHg from baseline was considered consistent with hypovolemia. Results from the two methods were compared.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 22 patients were enrolled in the study. Three were excluded for incomplete data (1) or incorrect collection (2). A total of 19 patient data sets were analyzed. Pre-resuscitation, US identified 14/19 (73.6%) patients as hypovolemic; whereas, recruitment maneuver identified 17/19 (89.5%) patients as hypovolemic. Post-resuscitation, US identified 12/19 (63.2%) as hypovolemic; whereas recruitment maneuver identified 9/19 (47.4%) as hypovolemic. US and recruitment maneuver were concordant on 13/19 (68.4%) patients for both pre and post-resuscitation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Alveolar recruitment maneuvers to assess volume status is feasible.&nbsp; Results from this small pilot study show modest concordance with IVC U/S. Both techniques support that Clinical judgment is not sufficient for assessing hypovolemia and response to volume resuscitation. Further larger studies are necessary to determine the applicability and generalizability of recruitment maneuvers in determining volume status.

Extremity hemorrhage is the most frequent cause of preventable death from trauma, and exsanguination can occur prior to the arrival of first responders. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) created the Bleeding Control Basic (BCON) course to teach members of the public to stop the bleed, and&nbsp;one million people have participated since its 2015 inception. A 2019 letter to the editor of the ACS Bulletin called for BCON to be incorporated into the curriculum at all medical schools, and several offer training through their curricula, faculty coordination, or student organization. Medical student-champions are working to expand opportunities so that all medical students may be certified in bleeding control. We hypothesized that medical students would be empowered by BCON training and would support efforts to include BCON in medical education.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
First-year medical students who completed BCON training between January and August 2019 were administered optional surveys immediately following and six months after completing the course. Surveys inquired about students&rsquo; demographic information, previous experience, and reaction to the course using free text, select an answer, and five-point Likert-scale responses. Two-sample t-tests were performed on the coded Likert-scale responses.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
More than 1800 medical students completed BCON training; 442 first-year students completed post-course surveys, and 213 completed 6-month follow-up surveys. Immediately following the course, the average response was between Agree (4) and Strongly Agree (5) that the course taught the student the basics of bleeding control (4.65), the student would apply the skills to a live person (4.61), and the student is able to save a life (4.14). Follow-up responses were positive but significantly lower at 3.87, 4.19, and 3.56 respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Students supported recommending the course to other medical students at both time points (4.68, 4.31), though the follow-up response was again lower (p &lt; 0.001). Eleven surveyed students (5.2%) registered as instructors during the survey period. Notably, six students (2.8%) used course skills on a live person. Five reported control of the hemorrhage using direct pressure, and one was unable to control the hemorrhage using direct pressure, wound packing, and a tourniquet.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Through BCON, medical students have been empowered to save lives and advocate for and in their communities. Students learn life-saving interventions they can use immediately and develop teaching skills that will be valuable as future physicians. Our efforts, which do not catalog every BCON program, demonstrate benefits of using students as BCON advocates. All medical students should learn how to stop the bleed.

E. Schwab<sup>1</sup>, V. Petersen<sup>1</sup>, D. M. Stein<sup>1</sup>, T. Bongiovanni<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Francisco,Surgery,San Francisco, CA, USA","INTRODUCTION&nbsp;

Intimate partner violence (IPV) describes physical, psychological, or sexual harm by a current or former partner. IPV affects an estimated 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men in their lifetime, and is associated with significant health sequelae. In the trauma population, the prevalence of IPV is estimated to be 11-15%. Given these statistics, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) endorses universal screening for IPV in trauma settings. However, baseline knowledge of IPV is poor among surgeons and screening is variable. We designed a project to educate surgical residents on IPV and standardize IPV screening in all trauma patients.&nbsp;

METHODS&nbsp;

A curriculum on IPV education and screening was designed using peer-reviewed literature for surgery residents rotating at a Level 1 trauma center. Residents were surveyed prior to intervention using the Modified Provider Survey, a validated instrument that assesses IPV related attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. The education sessions took place via Zoom video calls, and focused on IPV incidence, epidemiology, and rationale for universal screening. We also provided framing language that normalized screening and disclosure of relevant reporting laws, and instructions for conducting the three-question Partner Violence Screen. An IPV survivor and trauma social worker shared stories and advice on how best to approach the topic with patients. Educational material was emailed to residents following the call and prior to the start of their trauma rotation.

RESULTS&nbsp;

Fifty seven surgical residents (64% response rate) spanning post-graduate years 1-7 completed surveys prior to receiving education. Only 4% of respondents correctly identified the prevalence of IPV. Only 6% of residents felt they had received adequate education on IPV, yet 100% believed that identifying victims of IPV was relevant to their specialty. Seventy-four percent of respondents agreed that a significant barrier to IPV screening was a lack of knowledge regarding appropriate questions. Eighty percent did not know how to respond to a positive screen, and 89% were unsure of community resources for victims.&nbsp;

CONCLUSIONS&nbsp;

IPV is a nation-wide problem affecting a significant proportion of trauma patients. A curriculum was designed and implemented in an academic general surgery residency program to address deficiencies in education regarding IPV. Although all residents considered identifying victims of IPV relevant to their career, few felt they had received adequate training in IPV and most identified lack of education as a significant barrier. Furthermore, residents vastly underestimated the societal prevalence of IPV and the majority never screened patients for IPV. These preliminary data strongly support the importance of implementing an IPV curriculum for surgical residents to enable universal screening of trauma patients. Next steps include assessing residents&rsquo; knowledge, behavior, and attitudes post-education, and tracking their screening practices.

Gaines<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Pittsburg,Pediatric Trauma,Pittsburgh, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Child advocates raised alarms about a potential uptick in child abuse during shelter-in-place (SIP) mandates amid the coronavirus pandemic. Previous research found seasonal&nbsp;variation for NAT during summer break, and during the financial crisis in 2008.&nbsp;<sup>1,2</sup>&nbsp; The aim of this study was to identify pandemic&nbsp;variation in non-accidental trauma in children presenting to a level 1 trauma facility.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Retrospective review of a regional pediatric trauma registry using External-cause-of injury codes and mechanism of injury descriptions.&nbsp;Data was analyzed via exact test analysis in order to test for independence between time and incidence for NAT.&nbsp;Odds ratios were calculated by logistic regression adjusting for age.&nbsp;Significant&nbsp;was considered at &lt;.05 with a 95% confidence interval.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 322 trauma admissions (153 pre-pandemic; 169 during). Confirmed NAT injuries were proportionally higher in the pre-pandemic group (17%) versus the pandemic group (6%). Children were more likely to be admitted for NAT prior to the pandemic (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;.002).&nbsp;When adjusting for age NAT outcomes were higher in the pre-pandemic group (p&lt;.000).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Admissions for NAT injuries in children decreased during the SIP pandemic orders. This unanticipated outcome raises awareness about dangers faced by kids at home, this year,&nbsp;they say it&#39;s even more urgent because of the pandemic which&nbsp;presents the perfect storm for the escalation of NAT.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We queried PubMed for military-relevant publications from 1950 to 2020 in the highest impact journals listed in the Journal Citation Report (JCR) in three practice areas: Medicine, Surgery, and Trauma/Critical Care. Boolean searches were developed using National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for both inclusion and exclusion. Baseline publication rates were defined using general military MeSH terms, and the MeSH term &ldquo;warfare&rdquo; was used to identify combat-specific publications. The proportion&nbsp;of military physicians relative to the civilian sector was used to estimate expected publication rates.&nbsp;The start of major combat operations was noted for Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War I, and Operation Enduring + Iraqi Freedom (OEF+OIF).&nbsp;A quadratic function was developed to assess publication rate trends controlling for the start of active conflict and conflict intensity. Comparisons were performed using Pearson&rsquo;s Chi Square with p&lt;0.05 considered a significant difference.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 1950 to 2020, a total of 713,350 manuscripts were published in the JCR high-impact journals queried. Of these, military-relevant manuscripts totaled 4,103 (0.58%), significantly less than the proportion of military physicians in the US (1.2%, p&lt;0.001). Subgroup analysis found 2,567 of 499,211 (0.51%) manuscripts in Medicine journals, 483 of 126,627 (0.38%) manuscripts in Surgery&nbsp;journals, and 1,052 of 87,512 (1.20%) manuscripts in Trauma/Critical Care journals. Relative to the beginning of each conflict, military-relevant publications peaked at&nbsp;3.1 years (95% CI, 2.5 to 3.7)&nbsp;and then decayed back to low baseline rates of publication within 6.2 years (95% CI, 5.0 to 7.4). Over the past 70 years, both Medicine and Surgery jurnals demonstrated&nbsp;consistently low rates of military-relavant publications&nbsp;in contrast to a significant upward trend in these publications in&nbsp;Trauma/Critical Care journals&nbsp;(Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Military-relevant publications are significantly under-represented in the medical literature. Notable exceptions include periods of active conflict and publications in Trauma/Critical Care journals. Efforts to fund, conduct, and disseminate military-relevant research in high-impact journals should increase to reflect the societal investment in military medicine.

Traditionally, the morbidity and mortality (M&amp;M) conference is a weekly non-punitive peer-reviewed forum designed to reflect upon and take ownership of adverse events; and while ethical issues may be raised, the focus is largely on technical or clinical errors. Just as formal review of these clinical errors is fundamental to the development of sound surgical judgement, it is imperative to allow space to exercise the development of ethical decision-making. We present a quality initiative created to integrate ethics as a core component of surgical M&amp;M.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  In 2019, our institution instituted a 20-minute Ethics M&amp;M into regularly scheduled M&amp;M assuring full attendance by residents and staff, and enabling lively discussion to enhance resident education. This allowed review of cases that were ethically complex or presented an element of moral ambiguity as determined by the involved surgeons. Topics have included compassionate extubation, moral distress, concepts of entrustment, directed organ donation, and the role of trainees in the COVID pandemic. As is traditionally done, a resident presents a brief synopsis of the case; however, unlike traditional M&amp;M a second resident facilitates a discussion interspersed with questions and relevant literature to enhance ethical learning. A post-conference survey with semi-structured interview questions was conducted to evaluate the impact of this conference on residents. Axial coding was performed to elicit themes, as we begin developing a grounded theory.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The preliminary survey-response rate was 24% (12/49 residents). All resident responses indicated utility of the Ethics M&amp;M to promote bioethics discourse, to improve surgical judgment, and to enhance the surgical educational experience. Themes elicited from the semi-structured interview questions suggest that Ethics M&amp;M provides a meaningful bioethics discussion, allows for different perspectives, and is a useful tool to reduce moral distress.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Based on resident respondents, this forum promotes open discussion of ethically complex events leading to an experience that was meaningful and has the potential to reduce moral distress among residents and faculty alike. We demonstrate that the implementation of an ethics-specific M&amp;M is both a feasible and an effective platform for ethics discourse in which to integrate ethics didactics and enhance surgical curricula.

Maatman<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Medical College Of Wisconsin,Milwaukee, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Students encounter considerable stress on their clerkships, specifically the surgical clerkship is a difficult environment for medical students. Previous research has shown that students who completed surgical clerkships were more cynical and intolerant to ambiguity. It was also found that students who completed surgical clerkships early in their first clinical year were less confident as the year progressed. &nbsp;Art has been a form of reflection that is used to counter this effect.&nbsp; A study used Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and art therapy (engraving method) found that REBT and art therapy increase the self-esteem and resilience in students. &nbsp;There is some research that indicates that artmaking helps students gain understanding in relation to self, patients, pain, suffering, and the role of a doctor.&nbsp; Comics are an art form that allows for sharing of medical experiences without high artistic skill expectations. &nbsp;In fact, Surgeons are a particular group reported to singled out in comics drawn by medical students. We sought to understand how drawing comics of the surgical experience helped students reflect and manage stress.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The Medical College of Wisconsin Surgery clerkship for third-year medical students offered a 1-hour session on reflective cartooning to combat stressors. The session consists of a warm up drawing activity, brief explanation, time to draw a comic about both a positive and negative situation, and time to share comics. The sessions occur after the first month of the two-month rotation.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;There were 198 participants who took part in cartooning sessions in the surgical clerkship. There was 131 (66%) completion of the post session survey. Of the students who completed the survey 59(45%) reported being highly stresses and 30(22) reported being stress on the surgery clerkship. Seventy-two(80%) reported decreased levels of stress after completing the cartooning session. Seventy-nine(88%) reported that it helped them reflect on the situations they depicted. 16 (18%) of participants drew a comic about a negative experience they had not shared before. Fifty percent and 36% of the participants were highly satisfied and satisfied respectively with the session.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the session is successful in helping students reflect and share. They have been able to share situations they have not shared before. Participants reported it helped reduce their stress levels. Additionally, satisfaction with the sessions was high. The session helps participants in a short time to process some of the challenges in a safe and structured environment.

Lin<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania,Division Of Plastic Surgery, Department Of Surgery,Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Historically, surgery was born and developed through the visual work of artist-scientists, yet visual art courses in modern surgical education are rare. In the 21st-century, some medical school and residency curriculums have incorporated visual art courses to foster skills such as empathy and observation, as well as to improve anatomical understanding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the existing literature of learner creation of visual art as an educational tool in surgery and to discuss its potential in augmenting surgical learning.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A systematic review of surgical educational interventions involving learner drawing, painting, and&nbsp;sculpting was conducted searching PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase,&nbsp;Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Education Resources Information Center. Articles written in a language other than English and articles detailing historical figures and practices were excluded.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Our search yielded 388 unique articles, and of those 12 met inclusion criteria. Seven reported educational interventions for plastic surgeons (58.3%), followed by obstetrics and gynecology&nbsp;residents (16.7%), medical students with plastic and orthopaedic surgeons (8.3%), neurosurgeons (8.3%), and any surgeon (8.3%). Seven articles were descriptions of drawing and sculpting courses designed to develop the &ldquo;art&rdquo; of surgery such as judgement or aesthetic sense (58.3%). The other five publications described initiatives aimed at teaching or assessing surgical anatomy or knowledge (41.7%). Common goals and subjective outcomes included the measurement and observation of live models to enhance judgement of proportions, improved understanding of three-dimensional (3D) anatomical structure, improved hand-eye coordination, and improved&nbsp;communicative drawing ability for live patient education and the medical record. Notable objective findings included significantly improved retention of anatomy, correlation of drawing and image labeling with in-service exam scores, and correlation of procedural drawing with ability to perform the same procedure in a simulation.&nbsp;Themes about the impact of drawing and sculpting on surgical practice included benefits in the areas of observation, aesthetic sense, surgical anatomy and knowledge, surgical skills, doctoring, and wellness.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;While most identified articles focused on honing principles common to both realistic art and aesthetic surgery, our review suggests that all surgical disciplines could benefit from artistic training through improved visual communication and deeper understanding of 3D anatomy. We propose that visual art education serves as an interesting and important educational tool to improve perceptual skill and anatomical understanding in the modern surgeon.

In this study, we seek to evaluate the quality and readability of freely available patient information resources found on the internet for deep vein thrombosis.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Internet searches for &ldquo;deep vein thrombosis&rdquo; were conducted on a cleared-cache web browser in July 2020 across three search engines: Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and the two metasearch engines Dogpile and Yippy. Two raters independently scored websites on four dimensions and resolved discrepancies via consensus. The Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) formula, Flesch-Kincaid (FK) Grade Level, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) Index, and Dale-Chall (DC) Readability Index were used to assess readability. Statistical analysis was performed with RStudio with ANOVA.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of 125 websites collected, 35 met inclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion included: duplications 78, no original written patient education material about DVT 6, for physician use 2, not accessible 2, closed access websites 2. The type of website included: open access 13 (37.14%), government agency 8 (22.86%), hospital/healthcare organization 7 (20.00%), professional medical society 4 (11.43%), industry-sponsored 3 (8.57%). Quality scores are outlined in Table 1. The majority of websites (71.4%) discussed pulmonary embolism as a complication in detail. Most websites (85.7%) also described preventative measures. Anticoagulation (94.3%) was the most discussed treatment option. Placement of an IVC filter (71.4%) was the most commonly discussed procedure, followed by thrombolysis (65.7%), surgical thrombectomy (31.4%), and catheter-directed thrombectomy (20.0%). Professional medical society sites (3.00 [IQR 2.38-3.50]) had significantly poorer accountability than government agency (8.50 [IQR 5.25-8.75]), hospital/healthcare provider (6.50 [IQR 2.75-7.50]), industry-sponsored (7.0 [IQR 6.50-11.00]), and open access (11.00 [IQR 9.00-12.00]) (p=0.005). Overall readability was slightly difficult with a median FRE 61.95 (IQR 56.60&ndash;70.05) (interpreted as grade level 8-9 [IQR 8-10]), an FK grade level 9 (IQR 7-10), a SMOG grade level 9 (IQR 7-10), a DC grade level 9-10 (IQR 9-10).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Quality of freely available online patient information resources on deep vein thrombosis is quite variable and readability is not ideal for patients. While professional medical society sites did have poorer accountability, type of website did not significantly predict any other quality scores. Providers are encouraged to provide a direct list of websites with information on deep vein thrombosis to their patients due to the variability in quality and readability present.

The Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) is a quantitative and fluid measurement of the online influence of research. The objective of this study is to determine if AAS of articles correlates with traditional bibliometrics such a journal impact factor and citation count in the Orthopaedic Surgery literature.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The 10 most cited articles from each of the 15 Orthopaedic Surgery journals with the highest impact factor in 2014 and 2017 were reviewed. For each article, the AAS was collected using the Altmetric Bookmarklet application and number of citations was recorded from SCOPUS. Journal impact factor was recorded from Journal Citation Reports. Statistical analysis was completed using descriptive statistics and Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient in Microsoft Excel.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 300 articles published in either 2014 or 2017 were analyzed. A significant weak positive correlation was found between citation count and AAS for 2014 (r = 0.2802, p = 0.0014) while there was no correlation found for 2017 (r = 0.0202, p = 0.8138) (Figure 1). There was a no significant correlation between impact factor and AAS in either 2014 ( r = 0.0700, p = 0.8041) or in 2017 (r = 0.0701, p = 0.8015) (Figure 2).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;A possible correlation between AAS with citations and impact factor may be seen in the Orthopaedic Surgery literature. Articles published in 2014 had longer online exposure, possibly explaining the lack of correlation seen between the AAS and citations for 2017 articles. However, at this point in time AAS and traditional bibliometrics are not strongly correlated with one another in the Orthopaedic Surgery literature. Citations take years to accumulate while AAS provides an immediate evaluation of the scholarly impact of an article. An amalgamation of traditional bibliometrics including citation count and impact factor, and AAS may prove useful in determining the short and long term impact of publications in Orthopaedic Surgery.

At the onset of social distancing, our general surgery residency transitioned its educational curriculum to an entirely virtual format with no gaps in conference offerings. The aim of this study is to describe our evolution to a virtual format and report program attitudes toward the changes.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
On March 15, 2020, our institution restricted mass gatherings. We immediately transitioned all lectures to a virtual platform. The cancellation of elective surgeries in April 2020 then created the need for augmented resident education opportunities. We responded by creating additional lectures and implementing a daily conference itinerary. To evaluate the success of the changes and inform the development of future curriculum, we surveyed residents (N=61) and faculty (N=94) regarding the changes. Classes and faculty answers were compared for perception of value of the online format.

Pre-COVID-19, residency-wide educational offerings were concentrated to one half-day per week. Once restrictions were in place, our educational opportunities were expanded to a daily schedule and averaged 16.5 hours/week during April. Overall, 41/63 residents and 25/94 faculty completed the survey. The majority of residents reported an increased ability (56%) or similar ability (34.1%) to attend virtual conference while 9.9% indicated a decrease. Faculty responses indicated similar effects (64% increased, 32% similar, 4% decreased). PGY-1 residents rated the changes negatively compared to other trainees and faculty. PGY-2 residents reported neutral views and all other trainees and faculty believed the changes positively affected educational value (Figure 1). Comments from PGY-1 and 2 residents revealed they could not focus on virtual conference as it was not &ldquo;protected time&rdquo; in a classroom and that they felt responsible for patient care during virtual lectures. A majority of both residents (61%) and faculty (84%) reported they would prefer to continue virtual conferences in the future.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The necessity for adapting our academic offerings during the COVID-19 era has afforded our program the opportunity to trial new platforms and expand our educational offerings. The majority of participants report stable to improved attendance and educational value. Virtual lectures should still be considered protected time in order to maximize the experience for junior residents.

Schroen<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Virginia,Surgery,Charlottesville, VA, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Virginia,Claude Moore Health Sciences Library,Charlottesville, VA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;It is unknown whether the gender of surgical resident authors and the gender of their surgical faculty senior authors are associated, and whether certain resident-senior author gender pairings have differential publication metrics.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;PubMed queries were performed for categorical general surgery resident publications with a department of surgery faculty senior author at a single institution from January 2017 - May 2020. Publication metrics were extracted for each publication using the Web of Science Core Collection. Author characteristics, including resident and faculty member gender, were obtained from an institutional database. Publication activity and metrics were compared between genders.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;360 total publications, representing 193 unique publications, were authored by 33 residents, of which 10 (30.3%) residents were female. 100 out of 360 (27.8%) publications were authored by female residents. 174 out of 193 (90.2%) publications had identifiable Journal Impact Factor and times cited data. Female resident publications, as compared to male resident publications, were significantly more likely to have a female faculty senior author (28/100 [28.0%] publications vs. 34/260 [13.1%] publications, p=0.001). Similarly, female resident first-author publications were significantly more likely to have a female faculty senior author (11/37 [29.7%] publications vs. 9/77 [11.7%] publications, p=0.02). At the resident level, female residents, as compared to male residents, were significantly more likely to publish with a female faculty senior author (median 27.2% vs. 0% of resident total publications, p=0.01). There was no difference in Journal Impact Factor or citations per year between male and female residents. There was no difference in Journal Impact Factor between male and female senior authors, however female senior authors tended to be less cited (median [IQR] 1.0 [0.2-1.3] vs. 1.8 [0.9-2.5] citations per year, p=0.06) (Figure).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Female surgery residents, as compared to male surgery residents, were more likely to publish with female surgical faculty senior authors. While male and female faculty senior authors published in similar caliber journals, there was a trend toward fewer citations garnered by female senior authors. These findings may help explain ongoing gender disparities in academic surgery.

This study addresses gender disparity in cholecystectomies as teaching case opportunities for senior residents.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;All patients undergoing cholecystectomy at an academic medical center were retrospectively queried from January 2016 to March 2020. The cohort included PGY4 and PGY5 general surgery residents who performed teaching cases as the senior resident. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to examine the association between resident gender, PGY level, and number of teaching cases performed.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;688 non-teaching (one-resident) cholecystectomy cases and 372 teaching cases (two-resident) cholecystectomy cases were identified. Of the senior residents at PGY levels 4 and 5, 33 were male and 40 were female. Resident gender had no impact on the total number of teaching cases, nonteaching cases, or average percentage of teaching cases per total number of cases. Multivariable analysis showed that PGY 5 level and case type significantly impacted whether a cholecystectomy was a teaching assistant case (p = &lt;.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;At our institution, resident gender did not change exposure to teaching assistant cholecystectomy opportunities in residency; residents at PGY level 5 perform significantly more teaching assistant cases than PGY 4 level residents, regardless of gender. These results may partially be explained by the relatively large number of female residents in our General Surgery residency program, but future, prospective evaluation of gender equality within the OR is critical to ensure all learners have equal access to operative learning and teaching.

Kwakye<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan,Medical School,Ann Arbor, MI, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Michigan,Department Of Surgery,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Despite the ACGME requirement of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; in residency programs, underrepresented minorities are disproportionately underrepresented in academic surgery. While efforts are being made in surgery to improve this gap, there is still a wide variation in URM representation in each residency program. This qualitative study aimed to gain insight into factors underrepresented minority (URM) interns identify as important in their rank list of General Surgery residency programs to aid institutions in increasing URM representation and creating supportive training environments in academic surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
URM general surgery interns who matched in 2020 were interviewed through semi-structured telephone interviews from June to August 2020 to identify factors impacting their residency ranking. Participants were recruited through social media platforms, emails, and a snowballing method. Interview guides were created by identification of important themes through a focus group of current URM medical students and review of existing literature on the subject.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
From 15 URM interns contacted, 5 were interviewed. Overall major themes identified influencing URM intern&rsquo;s rank list decisions include 1) presence of URM representation in the program, 2) program support of resident-led goals, 3) active inclusivity efforts and programs in place, and 4) direct experiences of current-URM residents who highlighted camaraderie amongst peers and empowerment of their voices being heard and respected by their department. Additionally, applicants found it difficult to determine how diverse programs were and relied on program photos of faculty and residents or day-of-interview interactions. All participants relied heavily on current URM residents at their program of interest as a source of information, and personal communication and relationships developed with these residents helped guide their decisions. Detractors from programs included interns concerned with being the only person of color in their program and no concrete initiatives or goals in place to support diversity and inclusion revealing a concern of performative allyship.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
These findings provide insight into important factors for URM applicants when evaluating general surgery residency programs, including current representation and support of URMs, active diversity and inclusion initiatives within a program, and lived experiences of current URM residents. General surgery residency programs should take steps to not only intentionally recruit URM applicants, but also create a supportive training environment that is diverse, inclusive, and empowering to ultimately improve representation in general surgery.

With general surgery residents having less exposure to the specialty and evolving personal and professional needs, the appeal of the field continues to change. Targeted interventions to increase trainee engagement are needed to fortify the pipeline for transplant surgery. We aimed to evaluate training factors that attracted the rising transplant surgery workforce to inform recommendations for best recruitment and education interventions. These best practices can be used to optimize the experience of trainees and attract the most talented workforce into transplant surgery.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A 38-question survey was distributed electronically to candidate members of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons (ASTS). Participants were surveyed about demographics, medical school and residency training settings, exposure to transplant surgery, and the career and academic mentorship they received. Descriptive statistics and t-test analyses were performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 324 ASTS candidate members surveyed, 94 individuals responded (29% response rate). Most (57%) participants reported having exposure to transplant surgery in medical school. At the start of residency training, those who had medical student exposure to transplant surgery had a higher interest level in transplant (p&lt;0.05). When exposed to transplant surgery in medical school, the average reported interest rating was 6.9&plusmn;3.0, on a Likert scale of 1 (not interested) to 10 (very interested), vs 3.4&plusmn;3.0 for no medical student exposure. A majority of respondents (73%) interacted with other residents who were excited about transplant surgery, while only 29% reported interacting with a transplant fellow who excited them about the field. The majority of trainees (76%) spent dedicated research time during residency, and felt supported by faculty during research time (64%) and their fellowship application cycle (73%). &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Mentorship, pipeline programs, and early exposure to transplant surgery in medical school can optimize recruitment and interest in transplant. Those with medical student exposure to transplant surgery had higher interest at the beginning of residency, emphasizing the need for early exposure and engagement throughout training. A high percent of transplant surgery trainees reported having mentorship in the specialty, suggesting that intentional mentorship may provide an important avenue for engagement with transplant. Given that less than one third of respondents had meaningful interactions with transplant fellows, there is an opportunity to improve the resident-fellow experience to optimize recruitment.

The key focus of this paper is to systematically review QI principles and techniques utilized in total joint arthroplasty to determine most successful QI tools.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A systematic search on MEDLINE/Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library and other sources was conducted from September 1991 through October 2018 using key terms orthopedic, plan do check act, statistical quality control, lean process, six sigma, lean six sigma, lean, and quality improvement. Inclusion criteria were implementation of a QI tool in orthopaedics written in English. The included studies were categorized into their specific quality and process improvement tool. The three primary improved outcomes from each article were recorded along with the date, author and subspecialty.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Thirty &ndash; four eligible studies related to joint arthroplasty were identified for inclusion in the systematic review. The most common outcomes that were improved in these publications were: length of stay (LOS) &ndash; 35%, cost &ndash; 26%; medication management &ndash; 17%; and patient education 11%. Lean and clinical care pathways most commonly improved length of stay and cost; plan-do-check-act (PDCA) most commonly improved medication management; and shared decision-making improved patient education and satisfaction.

In June, 2020, social-distancing guidelines secondary to COVID-19 rendered many traditional boot camp methods impossible. Herein, we report quantitative and qualitative data from a multi-hospital academic center&rsquo;s innovative surgical boot camp that used group learning and reflective practices to engage interns in a socially-distant manner while improving clinical skills, knowledge and confidence.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;To maintain the value of in-person experiential learning in spite of distancing requirements and subsequent resource constraints, a team of surgical educators and simulation experts re-engineered boot camp to optimize individual learner impact through group learning and reflective practice. Interns from six specialties were divided across six sites arranged to minimize physical contact. Brief lectures were delivered via Zoom Meetings for content consistency. Faculty received proctor guides to facilitate group simulations, with pre- and post-briefings for individual engagement. Attendees completed a multiple choice and free response survey assessing the effectiveness of boot camp across multiple domains. Faculty feedback was also elicited. Free text evaluations were analyzed with a constructivist grounded theory approach as described by Mills et al., 2006.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 39 boot camp participants, 22 completed a survey (56% response rate). 82% of surveyees agreed or strongly agreed the modified training expanded their ability to apply theory or knowledge to their current level of practice. 73% agreed or strongly agreed it provided practical experience appropriate for their work duties. Qualitative analysis affirmed that group simulations were instructive, briefings allowed for individualized feedback in spite of activities being team-based, and an emphasis on systematic care approaches increased attendees&rsquo; confidence. 12 of 20 faculty provided feedback (60% response rate) which supported the use of small groups and reflective teaching to reinforce key principals and increase learner interest.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This analysis supports the feasibility of teaching crucial technical and non-technical skills in COVID-compliant conditions while facilitating learner engagement with positive results. Follow-up studies will assess long-term impacts of boot camp and further evaluate effects of group learning and reflective practices. This study suggests that these methodologies enable quality surgical education in the setting of limited social interactions and physical resources, which is imperative in light of COVID-19 resurgences.

Applicants commonly rely on institutional websites to compare and contrast program elements. The information on these websites can attract or deter applicants and can have a major impact on their application costs, rank lists, and career goals. The objective of this study was to determine the accessibility and content of urology residency program websites.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A list of accredited urology residency programs was obtained from the American Urological Association residency directory. A total of 141 program websites were evaluated for the presence of 53 criteria, which were categorized into 5 groups: personnel information, applicant information, program information, training/research, and resident benefits. Residencies lacking an available website or functional links were excluded from the study.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 53 criteria analyzed, only 24 were featured on more than 50% of the websites. Less than 10% of the programs had available information regarding resident contact information (5.67%), alumni contact information (2.84%), frequently asked questions (9.22%), electives (9.93%), night float (5.67%), and board pass rates (5.67%). The 3 factors most commonly available included program description (100%), coordinator contact information (88.65%), and clinical sites (87.94%). None of the 141 programs had all 53 criteria available on their website.

Huang<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Cleveland Clinic Foundation,Department Of Colorectal Surgery,Cleveland, OH, USA <sup>2</sup>Cleveland Clinic Foundation,Lerner Research Institute,Clevealnd, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Colitis-associated cancer (CAC) is a feared consequence of ulcerative colitis. The inflammatory microenvironment, especially the stromal fibroblasts, is associated with increased development of neoplasia. Further, even in the absence of histological neoplasia, transcriptional inflammatory and neoplastic signatures exist. Patient-derived epithelial organoids and fibroblasts, with high-resolution single cell analysis, permit unprecedented dissection of transcriptional expression. Single cell nuclear analysis was used to discriminate cell identity and individual cell transcriptional expression. We hypothesize that co-cultures of CAC epithelial organoids with cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) will have a richer immune profile when compared to co-cultures of CAC epithelial organoids and proximal, histologically normal fibroblast.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Matched patient derived epithelial organoids were co-cultured with fibroblasts from an area of CAC, or with an area of proximal colon that was histologically normal. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (sn-RNA-Seq) was performed (10x Genomics). Data analysis was performed in R utilizing the Seurat package for clustering and differential expression analysis.&nbsp; Epithelial cells were removed from the analysis through gene filtering. Dimensionality reduction was performed using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection. Differential expression testing was performed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test with correction for multiple comparisons.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Integrated analysis of the two co-culture conditions generated 8 distinct cell clusters, one of which was unique to the proximal fibroblast co-culture condition. Both groups show broad transcription of IL-24, as has been previously shown in patients with ulcerative colitis, along with IL-11, a cytokine with both anti-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic roles. The cancer fibroblast co-culture transcriptional profile contains a unique inflammatory profile including IL6, IL33, CCL3 and CCL5, which have been shown to play key roles in tumor immune evasion and trafficking of immune cell-types including tumor-associated macrophages (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We demonstrate that in vitro modeling of colitis-associated cancer epithelia with matched normal colon and CAC stromal fibroblasts allows for the generation of a phenotype specific immune signature. Consistent with the underlying ulcerative colitis phenotype of both co-culture conditions, we see strong transcription of the anti-inflammatory IL-24 and IL-11. Despite the presence of only fibroblast and cancer epithelia, our in vitro model showed a distinct immune phenotype when CAFs were co-cultured with cancer organoids.

Yoo<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Brigham And Women's Hospital,Surgery,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The myofibroblast is a gastrointestinal stroma cell that regulates epithelial proliferation, mucosal repair, and fibrosis through paracrine signaling, and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of colitis-associated cancer.&nbsp; The myofibroblast is the predominant nonmalignant stromal cell of the tumor microenvironment and a major reservoir of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, that is inducibly expressed in the setting of colitis.&nbsp; Angiogenin, a secreted 14-kDa member of the ribonuclease superfamily, enhances cell growth and survival.&nbsp; We have recently reported that angiogenin regulates pro-inflammatory mediator signaling within the myofibroblast, directly regulating COX-2 production via protein kinase D signaling.&nbsp; However, the physiologic impact of angiogenin signaling within the myofibroblast on colitis-associated cancer has not been previously studied.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Angiogenin knock-out (ANG-KO) C57BL/6 mice (n=8), a whole-body homozygous knockout strain, along with wild-type mice (n=8) were given azoxymethane (AOM, 5mg/kg I.P.), a colon carcinogen, 2 days in advance of three cycles of 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS).&nbsp; Each cycle consisted of 5 days of 3% DSS in the drinking water, followed by 16 days of regular water.&nbsp; This AOM-DSS colitis model leads to predictable and reproducible dysplasia/cancer.&nbsp; Disease activity index (DAI) was recorded during the &ldquo;colitis&rdquo; phase of each cycle.&nbsp; A colonoscopy was performed 1 week after each DSS treatment, and mice were euthanized 1 week after the 3rd DSS cycle.&nbsp; Gross pathology was analyzed.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 16 mice, 1 ANG-KO mouse died during AOM-DSS treatment.&nbsp; Of the remaining mice, there were no differences between WT and ANG-KO C57BL/6 mice in terms of disease activity index (weight loss, stool consistency, rectal bleeding) or colon length following AOM-DSS treatment.&nbsp; ANG-KO mice developed significantly fewer and smaller tumors compared to WT mice.&nbsp; In 7 ANG-KO mice only 3 distal tumors formed (0.4 tumors/mice) and all were &lt;2mm in diameter.&nbsp; In comparison, 23 tumors formed in 8 WT mice (2.8 tumors/mouse). 11 tumors were &gt;2mm and 12 were &lt;2mm in diameter.&nbsp; 13 of the 23 tumors that formed in WT mice were in the mid-colon.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In a mouse model of colitis-associated cancer, AOM-DSS treatment leads to significantly diminished tumor growth in ANG-KO mice with no apparent impact on the severity of colitis.&nbsp; These results suggest that targeting stroma-mediated COX-2 expression via angiogenin may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of colitis-associated cancer.

Milsom<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Weill Cornell Medicine / New York Presbyterian Hospital,Department Of Surgery, Section Of Colon & Rectal Surgery,New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

&nbsp; Endolumenal therapies in cardiac and vascular surgery have led to improved outcomes and excellent safety profiles compared to open or laparoscopic methods, and percutaneous access (PA) to the upper GI tract has gained popularity for tube placement and excision of superficial mucosal lesions.&nbsp; We explored the hypothesis that PA to the large intestine may expedite complex endolumenal therapy, improve safety, and access sites can be reliably closed.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

&nbsp; Using a 3D ex-vivo model with a porcine colorectum and abdominal wall, we secured the intestine to the abdominal wall with T-bar (gastrointestinal anchor set, HALYARD) and created 8Fr and 10 Fr holes under an endoscopic visualization (PCF-H180AL, OLYMPUS).&nbsp; We closed puncture sites with endoscopic clips (EZ clips, OLYMPUS) in two ways; (1) closing only puncture sites: P group and (2) closing both puncture sites and T-bars: PT group, and measured the leak pressures.

&nbsp; Next, 3 cm mucosal &ldquo;lesions&rdquo; were created at the posterior and lateral walls of the cecum. We performed an endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) with a 5 mm margin in three ways; (1) using a standard technique with ESD knife (DualKnife, OLYMPUS): STD group, (2) using percutaneous access (PA) with laparoscopic grasper (Gimmi, 2.8 mm, Germany) through 8 Fr sheath and ESD knife: PA with G group, and (3) using percutaneous access with laparoscopic grasper and electrocautery through 8 Fr sheaths (PA with GE group).&nbsp; We evaluated the procedural outcomes of these groups.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

&nbsp; Of 20 trials (10 in each group), the P group had&nbsp;significantly shorter closing time than&nbsp;the PT group (3.2&nbsp;vs 7.6&nbsp;min, P &lt; 0.001), and required less number of clips&nbsp;(3.8&nbsp;vs 7.2,&nbsp;P &lt; 0.001). Only one case in the PT group had&nbsp;the air leakage from 10 Fr hole&nbsp;(leak pressure: 44 mmHg).&nbsp; There was no leakage up to 60 mmHg in other cases.&nbsp;

&nbsp; Next, a total of 46 lesions were removed successfully.&nbsp; There was no perforation in all procedures.&nbsp; PA with G and PA with GE groups had significantly shorter total procedure time, faster dissection speeds, and fewer muscular injuries than the STD group.&nbsp; Moreover, the dissection speed of the PA with GE group was significantly faster than the PA with G group (Table).&nbsp; Regarding the PA with GE group, there were no differences in procedural outcomes between posterior and lateral wall lesions.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;

&nbsp; In an ex vivo porcine colon model, complex endolumenal procedures (ESD of large &ldquo;polyp&rdquo;) appear to be greatly expedited with fewer colon wall injuries using percutaneously inserted tools.&nbsp; The PA sites appear to be able to be reliably closed endoscopically.&nbsp; Future development of PA along with endolumenal therapies of the colon in vivo appears to be warranted.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The DiscovEHR project has created a database of whole exome sequences linked to clinical EHR data from patients in the Geisinger health system who consented to participate in the MyCode Community Health biobanking program. This analysis included all non-Hispanic White patients with existing exome sequence data who were &gt;18 years of age. Diverticular disease cases were identified by querying the EHR database for relevant ICD-9/10 diagnostic codes. Controls were defined as individuals with no recorded history of diverticular disease. Additional clinicopathologic and demographic information was obtained from the EHR database. In selected patients open chart reviews were also conducted to confirm the phenotype. Rare coding variants (minor allele frequency &lt;.0001) were identified from whole exome sequence data in the ARHGAP15, COLQ, FAM155A, ABO and ANO1 genes, which has been identified in previous genome wide association studies. The prevalence of rare variants in the diverticular patients was compared to the variants in the control population using a chi-square and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The study population consisted of 135,841 MyCode participants with exome sequence data. The mean age was 57.3 years (SD 18.1), and 61.0% of patients were female. There were 16,358 (12.0%) patients&nbsp;identified with diverticular disease, and 119,483 controls. Study participants with diverticular disease were significantly more likely to be male (43.6%), be former or current smokers (57.9%) and to consume alcohol (61.8%) compared to controls (38.4%, 54% and 60.6%, respectively). Cases were older than controls (mean of 70.9 years compared to 55.7). Median BMI did not differ between cases and controls (31.2 compared to 31.5). Rare variants were identified in&nbsp;each of the target genes; these were observed in 46 diverticular disease patients and in 93 controls (p&lt;.0001, OR and 95% CI: 3.5 (2.25-5.0)).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This analysis replicates previously reported genetic associations with diverticular disease, lending increased evidence to the genetic underpinnings of a common, and often, very morbid disease. Initial follow-up analyses have further identified rare coding variants which may be causal for the association. Future studies are ongoing which may enable us to identify patients who are at most risk for development of more serious forms of disease, and therefore, allow the development or application of novel treatment strategies.

Higgins<sup>1</sup>, K. Modis<sup>1</sup>, M. Hellmich<sup>1</sup>, C. Chao<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch,Surgery,Galveston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Tumor necrosis factor &alpha; (TNF&alpha;) is a cytokine that regulates inflammation and tissue repair in colitis. In previous studies, patients with ulcerative colitis have lower expression of the transsulfuration pathway enzyme CSE in the colonic mucosa compared to non-UC colons, suggesting that CSE activity may limit the inflammatory process. TNF&alpha; signals through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the nuclear factor kappa &beta; (NFkB) pathways. The aim of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between CSE and TNF&alpha; signaling in human colonic epithelial cells (HCEC).


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The HCEC is a diploid epithelial cell line derived from non-malignant colonic tissue; it has been immortalized with ectopic expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase.&nbsp;TNF&alpha; (1 or 10ng/ml) was used as an inflammatory stimulus.MAPK was inhibited by one hr pretreatment with either the p38 inhibitor (SB 203580, 10uM) or ERK inhibitor (PD 98059, 30 uM). CSE activity was inhibited by pretreating for one hr with beta-cyano-alanine (BCA 3.0 mM). To assess cell migration, cells were seeded in transwells and allowed to migrate toward % calf serum over time; cells were then stained and quantified. Immunoblots were assessed with primary antibodies to the activated forms of MAPK: pERK, pp38. Nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NFkB was assessed by immunocytochemistry.



<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:HCECs treated with TNF&alpha; showed a significant increase in migration at 16 hrs compared to vehicle (p&lt;0.0001). Pretreatment with either MAPK inhibitors or CSE inhibitor BCA significantly decreased both basal cell migration (p&lt;0.0001) and TNF&alpha;-stimulated migration (p&lt;0.0001). TNF&alpha; activated both pERK and pp38 in HCEC at 30 min by immunoblot (both p&lt;0.0001 compared to vehicle treated); pretreatment with BCA decreased TNF&alpha;-stimulated pERK (p&lt;0.01) but not p38. TNF&alpha; significantly increased nuclear translocation of p65 NFkB compared to vehicle (p&lt;0.0001). BCA pretreatment inhibited TNF&alpha;-stimulated nuclear translocation of p65 NFkB (p&lt;0.0001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:TNF&alpha; stimulates migration of HCECs and activates the MAPK and NFkB pathways. &nbsp;CSE is necessary for TNF&alpha;-stimulated migration of HCECs and its actions are mediated through pERK but not p38. CSE is also required for TNF&alpha; stimulated nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NFkB. Taken together, our data in this in vitro model of colonic epithelial cells demonstrates that TNF&alpha; mediated inflammatory processes are attenuated by CSE through both the MAPK and NFkB pathways. &nbsp;

Colon cancer stem cells (CSC) have been shown to be involved with tumor formation, chemotherapy resistance, and the progression of metastatic disease. Putative CSCs include cell surface markers CD133, CD24, and CD44.&nbsp; The clinical relevance of CSCs are mostly based on institutional studies. Using a bioinformatics approach, we hypothesize that a combination of these CSC markers has prognostic value in a large cohort of patients with colorectal cancer.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Clinicopathologic and gene set transcriptional data were collected from a cohort of 594 patients with colorectal cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The expression of CD133, CD24, and CD44 was individually defined as &ldquo;high&rdquo; or &ldquo;low&rdquo; based on the median expression as demonstrated in the literature. The R software was used to perform statistical analyses and survival curves using Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test. Gene Set Enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on hallmark genes pathways important in cancer development and progression.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Disease specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were not associated with tumors that are CD133-high or CD44-high alone. Patients with CD24-high tumors have significantly better DSS (p&lt;0.001) and OS (p=0.04). CD24-high, CD44-high and CD133-high tumors were associated with significantly greater EGFR, KRAS and Ki67 expression (p&lt;0.001). CD133-high tumors are not associated with conventional signaling pathways in preservation of stemness, such as NOTCH and Hedgehog signaling pathways. However, CD24 and CD44-high tumors are enriched for NOTCH signaling pathway (p=0.03). In the analysis of a combination of CSCs, there was no survival difference linked to patients with CD133-high/CD44-low tumors. Patients with CD44-high/CD24-low tumors have worse DSS (p=0.005) but no difference in OS compared to patients with CD44-low/CD24-high tumors. No specific gene sets associated with the hallmarks of cancer were significantly enriched in this group. Tumors that are CD133-high/CD24-low show significant negative enrichment of MYC targets (p&lt;0.002), E2F targets (p= 0.03), and G2M checkpoint pathways (p= 0.04), suggesting lower proliferation in these tumors. Patients with CD133-high/CD24-low tumors have worse DSS (p = 0.004) and OS (p = 0.04), after a 10-year follow up, and are more likely to have early and late recurrences.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study uses bioinformatics data to suggest the clinical relevance of putative colon cancer stem cell markers, and demonstrates that CD133-high/CD24-low tumors may be prognostic.&nbsp;

Surgery, Chemotherapy, and radiation are the most interventions to treat patients. However, these patients have a high risk of recurrence. It is important to investigate other novel agents that can be used alone or in combination with other treatments to increase efficacy and reduce the progression of colorectal tumors. Carfilzomib (CFZ), The second-generation irreversible proteasome&nbsp;inhibitor (PI) has been clinically shown to be effective for hematological cancers. CFZ is the 2nd PI to be approved by the FDA as a 3rd line treatment for multiple myeloma. However, the role of proteasome inhibition as anti-tumorigenic potential and molecular mechanism has not been fully investigated in the solid tumors such as&nbsp;colon cancer. The present&nbsp;study investigated and compared the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of second-generation irreversible proteasome inhibitor CFZ alone and in a combination well known chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin (DOX) and elucidate potential molecular targets on human&nbsp;colon&nbsp;HT-29 cells.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  HT-29 cells were cultured in McCoy&#39;s 5A medium with FBS at 37C with humidified conditions. Cells were treated with various concentrations of CFZ (0-500nM) or DOX (0-1.5&micro;M) or a combination of both for 24 and 72 hours to access cell viability using a Cell Counting (CCK-8) Kit. Total RNA was extracted using GenEluteTM Universal kit and concentration and quality were measured using Nanodrop. High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with RNAse inhibitor used to convert total RNA to cDNA. Genes involved in cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways were analyzed by quantitative-RT-PCR and relative expression performed using the delta-delta Ct method, also known as the 2&ndash;??Ct&nbsp;method. RPLP0&nbsp;(Ribosomal Protein Lateral Stalk Subunit P0) was used as a housekeeping gene.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: CFZ and DOX significantly inhibit cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in HT-29 cells at 72 hours of the treatment. However, CFZ is more potent than DOX. Furthermore, a combination of CFZ with DOX found to no have any further effect on the rate of growth inhibition. CFZ, DOX, and a combination of both down-regulate Cyclin E1, CDK4, and AKT1 gene Expression. Furthermore, only CFZ alone down-regulate the E2F1 transcription factor while DOX and a combination of both do not change the expression of the E2F1 transcription factor.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: CFZ inhibits proliferation by&nbsp;down-regulate the expression of Cyclin E1, CDK4, and AKT1 genes and the E2F1 transcription factor. Our data suggest second-generation PI CFZ might have therapeutic potential as an anti-cancer drug for colorectal cancer patients.

Anastomotic leaks (AL) are a major complication following gastrointestinal surgery that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Despite decades of improvements in surgical techniques and patient care, leak rates (1-24%) have not improved. Tissue hypoxia has been shown to increase anastomotic complications. However, it is unclear if hypoxia is the most important determinant of anastomotic healing outcomes as healing has been shown to occur when intraluminal antibiotics are administered. We hypothesised that hypoxia would alter the gut microbial profile in a manner that would influence anastomotic healing outcomes and therefore a correlation between hypoxia and healing outcomes would be seen. We performed a pilot study to develop a mouse model to investigate this hypothesis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The study consisted of two groups: resection and anastomosis (R&amp;A) (n=23) and control (n=9); Controls underwent a laparotomy without bowel resection. Throughout the study, optimisation of surgical technique and mouse recovery were undertaken to establish model consistency. These included optimising the suture number, preservation of local blood supply, as well as establishing methods of administering analgesia. The mice were sacrificed at day 3 and day 7 after surgery. Pimonidazole was administered to the mice one hour prior to sacrifice. Anastomotic healing was assessed and scored at time of sacrifice and isolated tissue samples were examined histologically by a pathologist blinded to the groups. Massons trichrome stain was used to quantify collagen deposition. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on anastomotic tissue to determine the quantity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a measure of neoangiogenesis, hypoxia (Pimonidazole) and cellular proliferation (Ki67). Halo analysis was used determine the H-score for each stain. Statistical analysis was performed on graph pad prism v7 and the spearman correlation test was performed to determine the relationship between these parameters.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Significant correlations were noted between the extent of hypoxia and VEGF (r = 0.6093, p = 0.0007) as well as hypoxia and Ki67 (r = 0.6452, p = 0.0007). Also, a significant correlation exists between VEGF and Ki67 (r = 0.6725, p = 0.0002). No correlation was noted between the extent of hypoxia and collagen deposition, infiltration of inflammatory cells, anastomotic healing and the development of anastomotic leaks.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
These findings further re-inforce findings in other pre-clinical trials that have shown that no correlation exists between hypoxia and the development of anastomotic leaks. This is surprising considering that a significant correlation that exists between hypoxia and neoangiogenesis as well as cellular proliferation. This suggests that other factors are at play which affect anastomotic healing outcomes. Further studies are needed to determine to what extent factors such as gut microbiota&nbsp;influence these outcomes.

ICG labeling has been shown to be helpful for definition of liver tumors or liver segments but does not provide clear demarcation between tumor and the corresponding liver segment. In the present study, a spectrally-distinct fluorescently-labeled tumor-specific antibody against human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell-adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) was used in combination with ICG for color-coded visualization of colon-cancer liver metastases and the corresponding liver segment in an orthotopic mouse model.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Anti-CEACAM monoclonal antibody (mAb 6G5j) was conjugated to near-infrared dye IR700DX (6G5j-IR700DX) with a fluorescence peak of 700 nm, which is sufficiently spectrally distinct from ICG with a fluorescence peak of 800 nm. Nude mice (n=10) received sutureless surgical orthotopic implantation of colon-cancer liver metastases derived from a patient. After three weeks, mice were administered 50 &mu;g 6G5j-IR700DX via tail vein injection 48 hours before surgery. 10 &mu;g ICG was intravenously injected after ligation of the left or left lateral Glissonean pedicle under magnification with a MVX10 microscope (Olympus), resulting in labeling of the segment with preserved blood flow in the liver. Intra-vital imaging of tumor and liver was performed with the Pearl Trilogy Small Animal Fluorescence Imaging system (LI-COR) and FLARE Imaging System (Curadel).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: On the 700 nm channel, the tumor had a clear fluorescence signal due to selective tumor targeting of 6G5j-IR700DX (Image A). On the 800 nm channel, the liver segment with preserved blood flow in the liver had a clear fluorescence ICG signal, while the left or left lateral segment had no fluorescence signal (Image B). Overlay of the images showed clear differentiation between the tumor and the liver segment.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Color-coded imaging of primary and metastatic hepatic tumors and the corresponding liver segment may improve the outcomes of anatomic resection due to clear distinction of tumor margins and distinct visualization of pertinent liver segments.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to improve wound healing, especially via enhanced wound angiogenesis. However, despite their clearly established potential, EVs have limitations that may limit clinical relevancy, such as low potency. We hypothesized that increased content of pro-angiogenic lncRNA&nbsp;HOTAIR&nbsp;within MSC EVs enhances their pro-angiogenic effects and thus their wound healing properties.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;LncRNA HOTAIR&nbsp;was loaded into MSC EVs by delivering a CMV-based&nbsp;HOTAIR&nbsp;plasmid to MSCs for endogenous loading&nbsp;via&nbsp;a concentration gradient. EVs were collected by differential centrifugation.&nbsp;HOTAIR&nbsp;content within EVs was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and RT-qPCR. Effects on migration of HDMECs by HOTAIR-loaded MSC EVs were determined using an in vitro scratch assay. Revascularization of healed tissue by HOTAIR-loaded MSC EVs was quantified in a 12mm circular excisional wound healing model administered on the dorsum of Sprague-Dawley rats. Wounds were created on day 0. Treatments were administered intradermally on day 3 and included a PBS negative control, plasmid backbone MSC EVs as negative control, unaltered MSC EVs as a control, and HOTAIR-loaded MSC EVs. Healed tissue was harvested on day 21. H&amp;E histology and CD31 immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify the amount of new blood vessels within the healed tissue.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;HOTAIR&nbsp;was visually confirmed in&nbsp;HOTAIR-loaded MSC EVs by gel electrophoresis, but was undetectable in unmodified MSC EVs. RT-qPCR confirmed a 900-fold increase of&nbsp;HOTAIR&nbsp;compared to control MSC EVs. HDMECs showed a more statistically significant rate of gap closure when treated with&nbsp;HOTAIR-loaded EVs (p&lt;0.01) than compared to unaltered MSC EVs (p&lt;0.05) compared to basal media. Total vessels originating from the dermis was increased in the HOTAIR-loaded MSC EVs compared to PBS (p&lt;0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between plasmid control MSC EVs or unaltered MSC EVs compared to PBS.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Loading lncRNA&nbsp;HOTAIR&nbsp;into MSC EVs is achievable by a concentration gradient-dependent method and offers potential to enhance the angiogenic properties of MSC EVs. The enhanced angiogenic properties of these EVs may be beneficial in healing chronic wounds and increase survival of skin flap.

HTS demonstrate increased collagen biosynthesis compared to normal scar (Craig et al., 1975) and overexpression of collagen I and III (Wong et al., 2014). The circadian rhythm helps to maintain physiological homeostasis and disruption of the circadian rhythm can lead to impaired wound healing (Sapahi et al., 2014). Neuronal PAS domain 2 (Npas2), a core circadian clock gene, is expressed in dermal fibroblasts (Landgraf et al., 2016) and has been shown to play a critical role in regulating collagen synthesis. (Sasaki et al., 2019). Previous studies showed Npas2 knockout mice demonstrated faster dermal wound closure suggesting that Npas2 can be a novel therapeutic target for pathological scarring and wound healing. (Sasaki et al., 2019). We have performed high throughput drug screening using mouse dermal fibroblasts with Npas2-lacZ reporter system and identified 5 FDA-approved hit compounds (Dwn1, Dwn2, Dwn3, Dwn4, and Dwn5) that suppress Npas2 expression in fibroblasts. We hypothesized that the therapeutic suppression of Npas2 by hit compounds will result in collagen synthesis downregulation and reduced collagen-related gene expression.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Collagen synthesis and collagen-related gene expression in clonal and primary human fibroblasts was compared between 5 groups treated with 5 compounds at 0, 0.1, 1, and 10 &micro;M. Fibroblast behaviors were characterized by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) for collagen-related genes and in vitro collagen accumulation was evaluated by Picrosirius red staining. The statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett&#39;s test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In clonal human dermal fibroblast, Dwn1 was found to have no significant effect on collagen deposition but interestingly, collagen type I and III gene expression was decreased. Dwn2 was discovered to simultaneously suppress collagen type III expression and increase collagen deposition in vitro. Dwn3 and Dwn4 had no effect in collagen deposition or gene expression. Dwn5 exhibited a tendency of increased collagen deposition and collagen type I down-regulation but no significant differences were observed. Additionally, some of the compounds significantly down-regulated collagen synthesis in primary human dermal fibroblasts.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our study demonstrated that Npas2 suppression in human dermal fibroblasts by some compounds modified cell behaviors resulting in changes in collagen deposition and collagen-related gene expression. This study suggests that Dwn1, and Dwn2 may be novel therapeutic agents for promoting collagen homeostasis and accelerated wound healing with minimal hypertrophic scarring.&nbsp;

Intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) is tightly regulated, but different metabolic programs characterize specific T cell phenotypes. We hypothesized that pH<sub>i</sub> is modulated by T cell receptor (TCR) ligation and corresponds with anti-tumor immunity.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Intracellular pH-sensitive dye was used to measure pH<sub>i</sub> in combination with surface markers by flow cytometry. T cells were activated in vitro via anti-CD3/28 antibodies or antigen-restricted ovalbumin peptide. pH<sub>i</sub> was modulated with 2-(6-chloro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)guanidine (Cl<sup>-</sup>GBI) and/or amiloride. Murine pancreatic tumors were injected orthotopically and harvested at 3 weeks. TCR sequences were obtained from genomic DNA.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We found a distinct low-pH<sub>i</sub> T cell population in activated mouse and human T cells, with a smaller population among murine splenic T cells, but none in mouse or human peripheral blood T cells. pH<sub>i</sub> was independent of extracellular pH. Intratumoral T cells exhibited a large low-pH<sub>i</sub> population compared with other organs. Antigen-restricted tumor-infiltrating or splenic T cells from tumor-bearing mice exhibited a larger low-pH<sub>i</sub> population compared with control T cells (Figure), as did Nur77-expressing T cells in both compartments. Low-pH<sub>i</sub> intratumoral T cells had decreased TCR diversity compared with controls, suggesting a clonal anti-tumor response. Low-pH<sub>i</sub> T cells exhibited higher surface activation markers (CD44, CD69, LFA-1, PD-1) and intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared with controls. These differences increased with in vitro activation. Low-pH<sub>i</sub> T cells also expressed higher surface Hv1, a voltage-gated channel that allows H<sup>+</sup> transport across the cell membrane. Hv1 blockade with Cl<sup>-</sup>GBI diminished low-pH<sub>i</sub> populations in both na&iuml;ve and activated T cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. These differences persisted in Na<sup>+</sup>-free media or in combination with the Na<sup>+</sup>-H<sup>+</sup> exchanger inhibitor amiloride.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
T cell activation, TCR ligation, and anti-tumor immunity are associated with low pH<sub>i</sub>. The critical role of pH in homeostasis suggests that pH<sub>i</sub> may mediate T cell phenotype. The role of H<sup>+</sup> flux in T cell activation requires further study.

Our recent work has identified that SETDB2 is an epigenetic enzyme that is downregulated in diabetic macrophages (M&phi;s) and may regulate inflammatory cytokine expression. We hypothesize that in diabetes exposure to coronavirus&nbsp;displays an increased M&phi;-mediated inflammatory response due to decreased SETDB2 in diabetic M&phi;s.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Bone marrow derived M&phi;s (BMDMs) and splenic M&phi;s were sorted from C57BL/6 wild type mice and two murine models of diabetes, db/db and DIO mice. Cells were infected with an established murine coronavirus model, MHV, at MOI of 0.5 and subsequent expression of TNF&alpha;, IL-1&beta;, and SETDB2 were analyzed by quantitative PCR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to evaluate H3K9me3, a repressive mark set by SETDB2 on the promotors of TNF&alpha; and IL-1b. Cells from mice with M&phi;s lacking SETDB2 (SETDB2<sup>f/f</sup>LyZ<sup>Cre+</sup>) were also isolated from BMDMs and infected as described above. Further, human monocyte derived M&phi;s were exposed to serum from critically ill adult male patients infected with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 for 24 hours. Subsequent expression of SETDB2 was analyzed by quantitative PCR.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;DIO and db/db BMDMs and in vivo splenic M&phi;s exposed to MHV displayed increased expression of IL-1&beta; and TNF&alpha; compared to nondiabetic controls at 24 hours post infection. Further, ChIP demonstrated decreased H3K9me3 at the promoter of IL-1&beta; and TNF&alpha;. In mice lacking expression of SETDB2 in M&phi;s, expression of IL-1&beta; and TNF&alpha;, and IL-6 was significantly higher in response to infection with MHV. Finally, human M&phi;Ms exposed to serum from critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated decreased expression of SETDB2.

Allogeneic transfusions&nbsp;are expensive and have been shown to increase perioperative morbidity and mortality, and decrease recurrence-free and overall survival. Operative blood loss can be cell-salvaged for immediate transfusion by recovery devices. Despite transfusion rates during pancreatic surgery as high as 75%, these&nbsp;devices are not used during pancreatic cancer surgery due to a belief that&nbsp;this will seed distant metastases. Though intuitively reasonable, this belief is belied by our modern understanding of metastasis biology. This study is the first to compare PDAC CTCs in the systemic circulation prior to surgery, at the time of surgery, and in cell-salvaged filtered blood collected to evaluate whether recovered blood contains a greater concentration of CTCs.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We conducted a prospective study of 50 patients with PDAC who underwent a pancreas resection at&nbsp;a high-volume academic center. Demographic, clinical, treatment, surgery type,&nbsp;estimated blood loss (EBL), intra-operative and post-operative transfusion data were collected. Pre-operative systemic, intra-operative systemic, and cell salvaged filtered blood was collected to evaluate CTCs using GEDI-captured PDAC-specific nucleated cells. Salvaged intraoperative blood was filtered through either a leukodepletion filter or a 40&micro;m microaggregate filter. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test was used to compare CTCs in pre-operative systemic, intra-operative systemic, and cell-salvaged filtered blood.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Median age was 67.5 years and 29 (58%) were male. Thirty-two (64%) had borderline or locally advanced disease. Twenty-six (52%) received neoadjuvant treatment. Thirty-one (63%) had a preoperative biliary stent placed. Forty-three (89%) had a pancreaticoduodenectomy and venous reconstruction was performed in 16 (32%) patients. On final pathology 2% were T1, 26% were T2, 52% were T3, and 16% were T4. Thirty-six (18%) had N1 disease and 32 (16%) had N2 disease. The median EBL was 1000ml, 32% were transfused POD0, and 13 had transfusions POD1-7. There was no significant difference in the number of CTCs from systemic-intraoperative blood (p=0.5) or from cell-salvaged filtered blood (p=0.665) vs. pre-operative systemic blood.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This prospective study is the first to objectively evaluate and compare the number of CTCs in systemic pre-operative, systemic intra-operative, and cell-salvaged filtered blood. Given no significant difference in the number of CTCs, this study serves as a foundation to consider autologous transfusion during PDAC surgery given the deleterious effects of allogeneic transfusions.&nbsp;Further study is warranted.&nbsp;

Wang<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Pediatric Surgery,Houston, TX, USA <sup>2</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Urology,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Renal fibrosis induces morbidity in pediatric patients, which can persist into adulthood. Hyaluronan (HA), a major extracellular matrix component, regulates fibrosis based on its molecular weight (MW). We reported that IL-10 upregulates high MW-HA synthesis via fibroblasts to attenuate fibrosis in a chronic kidney disease model. However, the effect of high MW-HA in acute kidney injury is unknown. Our data also suggests that HA is upregulated in epithelial tubular cells in an acute kidney injury model. We hypothesize that tubular cell-specific high MW-HA reduces fibrosis caused by acute kidney injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed unilateral ischemia/reperfusion(I/R) on C57BL/6J male mice treated with/without IL-10 and/or 4-methylumbelliferone(4MU), an HA inhibitor. 100 mg/kg BrdU was given 24h before harvest via IP injection. I/R or sham kidneys were collected at D3/7/14 for the levels of HA synthases(HAS1-3) and hyaluronidases(HYAL1-2) by qPCR, total HA by ELISA, and fibrosis outcome and tubular cell proliferation by IHC/IIF. In vitro, human proximal tubular HK-2 cells were used to determine the effect of IL-10 on HA enzymes with/without TGF&beta;, which mimics the fibrotic phenotype. Data mean &plusmn; SD; p &lt; 0.05 by ACNOVA(n&gt;2) or T test(n=2).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;I/R significantly increases HA production, and enzymes peak at D3. With IL-10 treatment, we observe upregulated total HA at D3&amp;D7, increased tubular cell proliferation, and reduced fibrosis. These effects are lost while HA is inhibited by 4-MU. In vitro, TGF&beta; significantly alters expression of HAS1&amp;3 and HYAL1 compared to control, and IL-10 treatment increases HA and restores HAS1 level compared to control (1&plusmn;0.23 fold).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Tubular-specific HA plays a protective role in response to acute renal injury, and the upregulation of HA by IL-10 can attenuate fibrosis. We identified a previously unreported role for high MW-HA that occurs in response to kidney injury. We also elucidated the mechanisms underlying HA-attenuated fibrosis to inspire novel therapeutics.

Development of a hernia repair mesh with minimal postsurgical complications is a compelling clinical need. A key challenge is the design of multifunctional biomaterials with optimal mechanical fidelity for 3D-fabrication, withstand biophysical rigor, and possesses intrinsic immunomodulatory attributes. In this study, we demonstrate the development of an intrinsically inflammation modulating in situ phosphate crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) and its application as a 3D-fabricated soft, pliable Biomesh for surgical hernia repair.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A Biomesh with in situ phosphate crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer (PVA-P) was fabricated by 3D-printing. To evaluate the efficacy of the Biomesh in preventing adhesions formation, it was implanted in rat ventral hernia model. To compare the Biomesh efficacy, a commercial polypropylene (PROLENE) mesh was used as a control. After 4 weeks of implantation, tissues were harvested for further analyses.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The Biomesh is soft, pliable, and easy to handle during its surgical implantation. After 4 weeks of implantation, the PROLENE mesh was completely covered with adhesions, the sutures and mesh were not visible. In the case of Biomesh implanted rats, no adhesions formation was observed at 4-week timepoint and the margins of the Biomesh and the sutures are clearly visible.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In vivo efficacy studies in rat ventral hernia model have demonstrated an enhanced efficacy of the Biomesh in modulating inflammation by downregulating proinflammatory cytokine expression levels without the need for exogenous anti-inflammatory agents. The Biomesh is significantly more efficacious in inhibiting visceral adhesions formation compared to the present standard of care hernia repair meshes. Development of a broadly applicable multifunctional Biomesh will be a major advancement in the surgical hernia repair and pelvic floor reinforcement.

This is especially true in vaginal tissue repair. Vaginal fibrosis is a debilitating problem effecting 73% of females who undergo vaginal surgery and more than 80% of post-radiation women. The understanding of the mechanisms of vaginal fibrosis development are limited, as are treatment options. To improve patients&rsquo; quality of life, we sought to create a novel injury model of murine vaginal fibrosis in order to develop techniques and therapies aimed at prevention and early targeted intervention.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  6 week old CD1 female mice underwent vaginal instillation of bleomycin.&nbsp; Mice were exposed to low dose (1.5U/kg, LD), high dose (2.5U/kg, HD), or combination of wire brush epithelial disruption followed by high dose (2.5U/kg, EDHD) bleomycin. Normal saline (NS) instillation was done as a control. Instillations +/- epithelial disruption occurred 5 times over 7 days. Tissues were harvested 3 weeks after the last instillation. Inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) changes were evaluated using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. p-values were determined by ANOVA followed by Dunnett&rsquo;s post hoc.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: ECM changes were most notable in EDHD-exposed vaginal tissue compared to NS, LD, and HD-exposed groups. Following EDHD, vaginal Col1a1 expression (p=0.052) was increased and percent positive vaginal Picro Sirius red staining was slightly elevated compared to NS control. LD, HD, and EDHD resulted in decreased vaginal leukocyte numbers (CD45+ cells) compared to NS control. F480+ macrophages were lower in EDHD mice (p=0.051) while Ly6G+ neutrophils were slightly elevated compared to controls. Vaginal hyaluronan (HA) was overall reduced in EDHD mice compared to NS controls, due to the mediated contributions of increased expression of both hyaluronan synthases, Has1 and Has2, and the hyaluronidase, Hyal1. No changes in macrophage or neutrophil numbers, nor total HA levels, were observed in LD or HD compared to NS controls.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We developed a novel murine model of vaginal fibrosis using a combination of vaginal epithelial disruption and bleomycin vaginal instillation. This model led to increased but disorganized collagen deposition and reduction in inflammatory cell populations. We also found alterations of the HA, which has been shown in other tissues to be an important factor in regenerative versus fibrotic healing. Future studies will include elaboration of other fibrotic markers and evauation of collagen metabolism. The development of this model will also allow future studies in potential prevention and treatment programs targeted to vaginal fibrosis. These discoveries will contribute to novel insights on the pathogenesis of vaginal fibrosis and yield targets to develop additional therapies for vaginal wound healing.

With the advent of lung cancer screening, lung nodules are being discovered with an increasing rate.&nbsp; Thoracic surgeons should be at the forefront of management of lung nodules due to their&nbsp;unique skillsets.&nbsp; Implementation of an electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) program can assist with growing a surgical program.&nbsp; Also, with the addition of more advanced bronchoscopic systems, it is imperative that thoracic surgeons learn these techniques.&nbsp; We aimed to determine the factors predictive of successful navigation and biopsy using electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective analysis of patients referred to the thoracic surgery service from 2014-2019 for evaluation of lung nodules was performed.&nbsp; Patients who underwent electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy and biopsy were included.&nbsp; Patient demographics, pulmonary nodule characteristics, biopsy instrument type were obtained.&nbsp; Recursive partitioning (CART) and multivariable regression analyses were used to identify predictors of both successful navigation and biopsy.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 73 patients who underwent ENB evaluation of 91 nodules from 2014-2019. &nbsp;There was successful navigation in 75.8% (69/91) of nodules with the average size being 2.9 cm (p=0.002).&nbsp; Bronchus sign was present in 68.1% (p=0.002) of cases. On multivariable analysis, bronchus sign, size of lesion, and distance to pleura were significant independent predictors of successful navigation. Based on CART analysis (Table 1), there was a 0.99 probability of successful navigation when the nodule was &gt;= 2.6 cm with a positive bronchus and a 0.93 probability when distance from the nodule to the edge of the pleura was &gt;=1.4cm. &nbsp;In comparison, the lowest probability of successful navigation (0.32) was observed when pulmonary lesion size was &lt;2 cm, a pleural distance &lt;3.4 cm, and negative bronchus sign. &nbsp;Of the lesions that had&nbsp;successful&nbsp;navigation, 45/69 (65.2%) had a diagnostic biopsy. The mean nodule size of diagnostic biopsy was slightly larger at 3.1 cm (p=0.23) and bronchus sign was present in 75.5% of successful biopsies. Based on CART analysis (Table 1), positive bronchus sign and lesion size &gt;=1.3 cm were most predictive of obtaining a diagnostic biopsy with a probability of 0.75. The lowest probability (0.27) was observed when lesion size was &lt; 1.3 cm.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Nodule size, distance to pleura, and bronchus size are independent variables of successful navigation when using ENB. However, of the lesions that were successfully reached, combined lesion size &gt; 1.3 cm and a positive bronchus sign were highly predictive of obtaining a diagnostic biopsy.&nbsp; These factors should be considered when implementing an ENB program in practice to optimize yield, particularly when first beginning a program.&nbsp; These data also support primary surgical intervention for more peripheral lesions in patients that are surgical candidates.&nbsp;

This study aimed to evaluate the population-based survival outcomes of primary pericardial mesothelioma using a US national cancer database.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We queried the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program for primary mesothelioma patients from 1973 to 2015. We included primary pericardial mesothelioma patients with complete follow-up data as well as primary pleural mesothelioma patients who were identified as controls. Demographic and clinical variables, including age, sex, race, year of diagnosis, history of malignancy, histological subtypes, and treatment modalities, were extracted. Propensity-score matching, calculated with a multivariable logistic regression model, was used to balance baseline characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were performed to compare overall survival between subgroups.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Forty-one pericardial mesothelioma and 15,970 pleural mesothelioma patients were identified. Before matching, when compared to the pleural mesothelioma counterparts, pericardial mesothelioma patients were younger (53.9 &plusmn; 17.5 vs. 71.5 &plusmn; 11.4 years, p &lt; 0.001), had higher percentages of female patients (46.3% vs. 20.2%, p &lt; 0.001), non-white patients (24.4% vs. 8.4%, p = 0.001), and were less likely to have been diagnosed in the most recent study decade (2006-2015) (34.1% vs. 43.5%, p = 0.002). The overall one- and two-year survival rates of the pericardial mesothelioma patients were 22.0% and 12.2%, respectively, with a median survival of 2 months (interquartile range: 1-6 months). Both chemotherapy and surgical resection showed survival benefit in the first 12 months, but the overall effects were not statistically significant (chemotherapy: log-rank p = 0.57; surgical resection: log-rank p = 0.25). After 1:2 nearest neighbor propensity-score matching, 38 pericardial mesothelioma and 76 matched pleural mesothelioma cases were identified. Compared to their matched pleural mesothelioma counterparts, pericardial mesothelioma patients were less likely to receive chemotherapy (23.7% vs. 50.0%, p = 0.013) and were associated with worse survival (median survival: 2 vs. 11 months, log-rank p = 0.0025; Figure 1).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;On a population-level, primary pericardial mesothelioma is an extremely rare cardiac malignancy with a relatively young age at diagnosis and a very poor prognosis. Surgical intervention and chemotherapy seem to improve short-term survival but are rarely curative. Multidisciplinary treatment is required to maximize patient survival.&nbsp;

Benharash<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - Los Angeles,Cardiac Surgery,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Advances in antiretroviral therapy have improved the prognosis of patients diagnosed with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).&nbsp; As a result, HIV positive patients (HIV+) are living longer and are therefore more susceptible to cardiovascular disease. However, data on the safety of major operations for HIV+ patients remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of HIV on clinical outcomes and resource utilization following major cardiac operations in a national cohort.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The 2010-2017 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to identify all patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valvular surgery, or aortic replacement. The NIS is the largest publicly available inpatient database in the US and provides accurate estimates for 97% of all hospitalizations. International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th Revision diagnosis codes were utilized to identify HIV+ patients. Inverse probability weighting (IPTW) was used to assess the independent association of HIV+ status with mortality, acute kidney injury, sepsis, routine discharge, duration of hospitalization (LOS) and adjusted costs. Propensity scores for IPTW were estimated from a multivariable regression model, which controlled for demographic, comorbid and hospital covariates.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 2,336,865 who met study criteria, 2,916 (0.12%) were identified as HIV+. Cardiac operations on HIV+ patients increased from 262 (0.09%) in 2010 to 555 (0.19%) in 2017 (p&lt;0.001). Compared to others, HIV+ patients were on average younger (54.7 vs 65.1 years p&lt;0.001), more likely to be Black (32.5 vs 7.5% p&lt;0.001) or Hispanic (12.9 vs 7.1% p&lt;0.001) and on Medicaid (18.9 vs 7.3% p&lt;0.001). They also had lower prevalence of comorbid conditions, except for endocarditis (10.4 vs 2.0% p&lt;0.001) and liver disease (11.8 vs 3.2% p&lt;0.001). However, rates of CABG, CABG-valve, valvular surgery and aortic replacement were similar between groups (p&gt;0.05). While HIV+ patients were admitted electively less often&nbsp;(44.2 vs 55.2% p&lt;0.001), they experienced longer LOS and higher costs but similar discharge status and in-hospital mortality (Table). After matching, HIV+ was independently associated with increased odds of acute kidney injury and sepsis. Furthermore, it was correlated with incremental increases in LOS and costs but not routine discharge or in-hospital mortality.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Cardiac procedures for HIV+ patients have increased steadily over the past decade. Although cardiac surgery in this population results in acceptable outcomes, this condition may be associated with increased risks of complications, LOS and costs. These findings may better stratify patient candidacy and operative risk in this vulnerable patient cohort.

The impact of intraoperative provider teamwork on intra- and postoperative outcomes was evaluated using an electronic-health record derived measure of team familiarity, based upon prior shared working patterns.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The study cohort comprised 3,290 adult cardiac surgical procedures performed by any combination of&nbsp; providers [cardiac surgeons (n=12), anesthesiologists (n=23), perfusionists (n=25), physician assistants (n=14), scrub nurses (n=71)] at an academic center between 2016-18. We computed&nbsp; team familiarity as the mean of prior cardiac surgical operations performed for all surgeon - non-surgeon pairs, during the 2 years prior to the date of surgery. Terciles of team familiarity (low: &lt;18 prior operations; medium: 18-28, high: &gt;28) were included in regression models to predict cardiopulmonary bypass duration (primary outcome) and postoperative outcomes (major morbidity, operative mortality, renal failure, intensive care unit hours, and hours of ventilator support), adjusted for provider experience and predicted risk (demographics, comorbidities, admission acuity, procedure type) using Euroscore II. The effect of team familiarity on outcomes was assessed across terciles of predicted risk.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Median (IQR) cardiopulmonary bypass duration was 132 minutes (88-194), and 510 (15.5%) patients developed major postoperative complications. The relationship between team familiarity and cardiopulmonary bypass duration significantly differed across terciles of predicted risk (p=0.0014) although not for the secondary outcomes (p&gt;0.05). Relative to low team familiarity, high team familiarity was associated with -14min (p=0.006) of cardiopulmonary bypass duration for medium-risk patients and -28min (p&lt;0.001) for high-risk patients, Figure. Increasing team familiarity was associated with a significant 1.9% decreased odds of renal failure (OR=0.98, p=0.045), while non-significant -0.14 ICU hours (SE.0.20, p=0.51), -0.18 ventilation hours (SE.0.14, p=0.19), 1.0% lower odds of major morbidity (OR=0.999, p=0.84) and 1.2% lower odds of 30-day mortality (OR=0.99, p=0.35).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Increased team familiarity was significantly associated with reduced cardiopulmonary bypass duration (greatest among highest risk patients) and renal failure. A significant protective effect was not found for other outcomes. Intraoperative processes of care that are reliant upon teamwork independently account for variation in care efficiency and may serve as future quality improvement targets.

Selection of lung transplant patients includes an evaluation of body mass index (BMI), as obesity is a relative contraindication. However, BMI changes may occur during the waiting list period, resulting in lower or higher BMI at the time of transplant. Previous single center studies have assessed the effects of waiting period BMI change on short-term outcomes of lung transplantation. The aim of this study is to assess the long-term outcomes of waiting list BMI changes.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The internal prospectively maintained Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) transplant database and electronic medical records were reviewed for single and bilateral lung transplants between February 2004 and December 2018. Patients were classified as underweight (&lt; 20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), obese (&gt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), or control (20-30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Obese and underweight patients were then further stratified based on whether they lost (-) or gained (+) weight during the waiting list period. The primary endpoint was overall mortality. Secondary outcomes were initial intensive care unit (ICU) hours, initial mechanical ventilator (MV) hours, initial hospital length of stay (LOS), and a composite of in-hospital complications. Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank test were used to compare overall mortality between the BMI groups. A modification of the z-test using Greenwood&#39;s formula for variance was used to compare the survival rate at 1, 3, and 5 years. Kruskal-Wallis, chi square, and Fisher exact test were used to compare the distribution of secondary variables. Statistical significance was indicated by p &lt; 0.05.



<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 644 cases were included in this study. The groups and their sizes are as follows: underweight and lost weight (BMI &lt; 20, -), 46/644 (7%); underweight and gained weight (BMI &lt; 20, +), 59/644 (9%); obese and lost weight (BMI &gt; 30, -), 80/644 (12%); and obese and gained weight (BMI &gt; 30, +), 32/644 (5%). 423/644 (66%) patients were in the control group (BMI 20-30). Log rank test indicated an association between overall survival and change in BMI from listing to transplantation (p = 0.01). There was also a significant difference in the initial MV hours between the BMI cohorts (p = 0.014).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Obese and underweight patients who trended toward control BMI (20-30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) during the waiting list period had better overall survival rates than obese and underweight patients who trended away. The waiting list period presents an opportunity for obese and underweight patients to improve their preoperative health status and long-term outcomes.

Outcomes of cardiac operations in CLL have been examined in limited series and are conflicting. Thus, the present study examined the association of CLL on clinical outcomes and resource use following cardiac operations in a nationally representative cohort.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;All patients (&ge;35 years) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, valve repair or replacement or a combination thereof were identified from the 2010-17 Nationwide Readmissions Database. The presence of CLL, as well as relevant patient and hospital characteristics were tabulated utilizing International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality while secondary outcomes included blood transfusion, perioperative complications (cardiac, respiratory, thromboembolic, stroke, renal, infectious, intraoperative), length of stay, inflation-adjusted hospitalization costs and unplanned readmission within 30 days of discharge. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was utilized to adjust for patient and hospital differences. The aforementioned outcomes were subsequently compared using the adjusted Wald and Pearson&rsquo;s Chi-Square tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of an estimated 2,288,576 patients included for analysis, 0.2% (n=5,248) had a diagnosis of CLL. Compared to their counterparts, patients with CLL were more likely to be male (79.4 vs. 69.3%, p&lt;0.001) and to be older (73.4 vs. 66.2 years, p&lt;0.001) but with a similar burden of comorbidities as measured by the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (3.4 vs. 3.5, p=NS). After adjusting for baseline patient and hospital characteristics, CLL was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality (3.2 vs. 2.8%, p=NS) nor perioperative complications (37.6 vs. 35.8%, p=NS) (Figure). Notably, CLL did not increase risk for postoperative infection (2.5 vs. 3.3%, p=NS). However, CLL was independently associated with requirement of blood transfusion (32.1 vs. 28.8%, p=0.04). The presence of CLL did not increase length of stay (10.8 vs. 10.6 days, p=NS) or hospitalization costs (50,776 vs. $51,461, p=NS). In addition, patients with CLL had similar rates of readmission at 30 days compared to their counterparts (14.2 vs. 11.7%, p=NS).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;CLL is not associated with excess mortality or complications following cardiac operations. However, the presence of CLL is associated with requirement of blood transfusion. Although cardiac operations may be safely performed in patients with CLL, inherent risks of transfusion should be considered and discussed in this population.

The purpose of this study aimed to examine pre-operative quality of life (QoL) reported by AVR patients, focusing on identifying associated predictors and assessing gender disparities.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We prospectively enrolled AVR patients into a patient-engagement program&mdash;a mobile application&mdash;SeamlessMD. This application provided educational materials and collected patient-reported outcomes at&nbsp;pre-op, 30-day, and 90-day post-discharge using multiple QoL instruments including the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12). Patient demographics and characteristics, operative details, and post-operative outcomes were obtained using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (ACSD). Descriptive statistics and multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate pre-operative QoL and quantify gender disparities.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We enrolled 130 AVR patients from July 2019 to May 2020, and 75 (58%) of them completed pre-operative KCCQ-12. Among these patients, 43% were females, and their KCCQ scores were significantly lower than those of their male counterparts in all the domains of QoL, including Physical Limitation (60.9 vs. 80.4; p &lt; .01), Symptom Frequency (57.4 vs. 77.3; p &lt; .01), Social Limitation (56.6 vs. 75.9; p &lt; .01), Quality of Life (41.8 vs. 52.6; p = .05), and Overall Score (54.0 vs. 71.2; p &lt; .01). Multivariable regression models identified female as a predictor consistently associated with lower scores in all the domains of KCCQ-12 among AVR patients (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Females have significantly lower pre-operative QoL scores in all the domains of KCCQ-12. Improved understanding of the contributors to reduced pre-operative QoL may facilitate tailored intervention strategies that could enhance outcomes and eliminate gender disparities.&nbsp;

Incidence of cardiac contusion (CC) in patients with sternal fractures (SF) has long been debated. There is limited data available on CC in geriatric patients (&ge; 65 y.o) with SF. The aim of this study was to compare incidence of CC in geriatric (GP) vs non-geriatric patients (NGP) with SF.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This IRB approved retrospective cohort study included 202 GP and 202 NGP with SF admitted to two level 1 trauma centers. Compared variables included age, gender, race, Body Mass Index (BMI), cardiac comorbidities, mechanism of injury (MOI), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), results of electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzymes, echocardiogram (ECHO), sternal surgery, cardiac surgery, ICU admission and ICU length of stay (ICU LOS), discharge disposition, and mortality. CC was defined as abnormal ECG in combination with elevated enzymes, or an abnormal ECHO.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
GP were significantly older (79.3 vs 44.0 y.o, p&lt;0.01) and were predominantly white females while NGP were mainly white males. BMI was similar in both groups. Cardiac comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and hypertension, were more common in GP (69.3% vs 21.8% p&lt;0.001). Predominant MOI was motor vehicle collisions (&gt;78.5%) in both groups, reflecting the most common &ldquo;steering wheel trauma&rdquo; injury in SF. GP had lower ISS (12.1 v 15.1 p&lt;0.002) and higher GCS (14.4 vs 13.2 p&lt;0.001). Frequencies of manubrium and sternum body fractures were similar in both groups. GP had higher rates of an abnormal ECG (60.4% vs 41.2% p&lt;0.001), while rates of elevated enzymes (43.3% vs 36.1%) and abnormal ECHO (34.6% vs 32.8%) were not statistically different (p&gt;0.3). CC was diagnosed statistically more often in GP (27.7% vs 14.9%) [Fig 1]. Rates of surgical stabilization of SF (9.9% vs 11.9%, p=0.5) and cardiac procedures (2.0% vs 5.0%, p=0.1) were comparable. ICU admissions (55.9% vs 55.4%) and ICU LOS (6.2 vs 7.8 days) were not statistically different (p&gt;0.1). GP were discharged to skilled nursing facility (SNF) most often, while NGP were mainly discharged home (SNF: 25.7% vs 8.9%, home: 39.4% vs 68.3%, p&lt;0.001). Mortality (11.4% vs 5.0%, p=0.02), including hospice discharge, was statistically higher in GP. Main reason for mortality in GP was thoracic trauma and in NGP was traumatic brain injury.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Despite being less injured, geriatric patients with a sternal fracture had higher rates of diagnosed cardiac contusion, possibly due to the higher incidence of pre-existing cardiac comorbidities. Geriatric patients with sternal fractures should be thoroughly screened for cardiac contusion even if cardiac injury is not directly related to an increased mortality in geriatric patients.

Gandjian<sup>1</sup>, R. J. Shemin<sup>1</sup>, P. Benharash<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - Los Angeles,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Although coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valve repair or replacement remain among the most common operations performed in the United States, wide variation in associated costs have been reported. Given the growing emphasis on value-based care, we examined the impact of hospital volume on index hospitalization costs, non-home discharge, and 30-day nonelective readmissions at a national level.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All adults undergoing elective CABG or valve operations were identified in 2016-2017 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Institutions were divided into volume quartiles based on annual elective cardiac surgery caseload, and comparisons made between lowest (low volume hospitals, LVH) and highest (high volume hospitals, HVH) quartiles. Categorical variables were studied using the chi-square test and continuous variables using the adjusted Wald or Mann-Whitney U test. The primary outcome was inflation-adjusted costs at the index hospitalization while secondary outcomes were non-home discharge and nonelective readmission&nbsp;within 30 days of discharge. Generalized linear models were fit to evaluate the independent association of volume with outcomes.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 560,660 patients included for analysis, 23.9% were treated at LVH and 28.8% were treated at HVH. Compared to LVH, patients treated at HVH were younger (65.3 years, standard deviation, SD, 10.2 vs 65.9 years, SD 11.5, P=0.003), less commonly male (69.3% vs 70.9%, P=0.009), and had a greater burden of comorbidities as measured by the Elixhauser Index (4.3, SD 1.6 vs 4.1, SD 1.9, P=0.008). Compared to LVH, HVH less commonly performed isolated CABG (44.3% vs 61.0%, P&lt;0.001) but more frequently performed combined CABG-valve (13.5% vs 11.9%, P&lt;0.001) and multi-valve operations (6.0% vs 2.6%, P&lt;0.001). Unadjusted mortality, non-home discharge, and 30-day nonelective readmission rates were lower at HVH compared to LVH, as were costs (Table). After adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, operations at HVH were associated with a $8,400 reduction (95% confidence interval, CI, $5,600-11,100) in index hospitalization costs relative to LVH. HVH were also associated with reduced odds of mortality, non-home discharge and 30-day nonelective readmission compared to LVH (Table).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this contemporary analysis, high operative volume was independently associated with reduced hospitalization costs and improved mortality following elective cardiac operations. Given a reduction in non-home discharge and readmissions, this effect likely extends beyond the index hospitalization, despite the increased complexity observed at high volume hospitals. Further study of practice patterns in high volume centers may guide efforts to reduce resource use.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 1750 total patients diagnosed with AAC during the study period, 664 underwent surgery for AAC. ED visits (n=292) or admissions (n=39) to sites other than site of surgery caused delays in definitive repair of more than 1 day in 42.3% patients and increased postoperative in-hospital mortality (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0&ndash;3.1 on bivariate analysis). 60% of patients initially sent home from ED or other hospitals did not have a discharge diagnosis of aortic pathology. &nbsp; Absence of a chest CT (CCT) scan on preceding ED encounters (19% of ED visits) increased subsequent in-hospital mortality (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.46&ndash;7.39, logistic regression).

Due to the rarity of sternal fractures (SF), data examining the relationship of cardiac contusion (CC) in patients with SF is scarce. The aim of this study was to characterize patients with SF who were diagnosed with a CC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This retrospective cohort analysis included 404 adult (&ge;18 years old) patients with SF who were treated at two level I trauma centers between January 2015 and May 2020. Patients were compared in two groups: with diagnosed cardiac contusion (CC) n=86, or without cardiac contusion (WCC) n=318. CC was defined as the presence of an abnormal electrocardiogram in conjunction with elevated cardiac enzymes, or as a wall motion abnormality seen during an echocardiogram. Analyzed variables included: age, comorbidities, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pulmonary co-injuries, SF pattern, sternal and cardiac procedures, ventilation requirements (including tracheostomy rates), ICU admissions, ICU length of stay (ICULOS), hospital LOS (HLOS), and mortality.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
CC was diagnosed in 21.3% of patients with SF. Mean age in CC patients was 67.4, while in WCC patients it was 60.1 (p=0.004), with a significantly higher prevalence of geriatric population (&ge; 65 y.o.) in the CC group (65.1% vs 45.9%, p=0.002). Comorbidities (94.0% vs 80.2%, p=0.02) and particularly cardiac comorbidities (atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension) were more common in CC patients (73.5% vs 48.2%, p=0.001) [Fig. 1]. ISS (15.5 vs 13.2), GCS (13.2 vs 14.0), and SF pattern (body, manubrium, dual, isolated, combined) were similar in CC and WCC groups, all p&gt;0.1. Pulmonary co-injuries (45.3% vs 31.4%, p=0.02) and particularly pulmonary contusion were significantly more common among CC patients (29.1% vs 18.2%, p=0.03). Sternal plating procedure rate was not different (5.8% vs 12.3%, p=0.09), while cardiac procedures were statistically more common in the CC group (8.1% vs 2.2%, p=0.008). Ventilation requirements (33.7% vs 20.8%, p=0.01) and tracheostomy rates (16.3% vs 4.7%, p&lt;0.001) were higher in CC patients. The CC group was admitted to the ICU more often (75.6% vs 50.3%, p&lt;0.001), but ICULOS was not statistically different (8.7 vs 6.3 days, p=0.09). CC patients had an increased HLOS (13.9 vs 8.9 days, p=0.02), and a statistically higher mortality (14.0% vs 6.0%, p=0.03).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Although the patterns and severity of sternal injury in itself were similar, patients with cardiac contusion had higher mechanical ventilation requirements and mortality rates, which could be attributed to their cardiac trauma, advanced age and pulmonary co-injuries. Thus, patients with a sternal fracture and cardiac comorbidities should be thoroughly screened for possible cardiac contusion.

As more ventricular-assist devices (VADs) are implanted for destination therapy, VAD infection is an increasingly common complication. To initiate development of bacteriophage therapy for VAD infections, particularly drive line infections (DLIs), we isolated, quantified, and categorized bacterial pathogens from retrospective and prospective cohorts of patients with VAD infections.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The study populations were: 1) a retrospective cohort of patients who received VADs from November 2003 to August 2017, and 2) a prospective cohort of patients with DLIs from September 2018 to May 2019. We classified each patient&rsquo;s VAD infection into three non-mutually exclusive subcategories: DLI, bacteremia, and pump/device infection. We also isolated or evolved bacteriophage and quantified each phage&rsquo;s ability to kill the prospectively collected organisms using plaque assays.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

In the retrospective cohort of 572 patients who underwent VAD placement, 186 patients (32.5%) developed a VAD infection, and 372 bacterial strains were isolated from these infected patients. Among these patients, 148 had DLIs, 83 had bacteremia, and 93 patients had pump infections. The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococcus aureus with 80 isolates (21.5%). Of the 146 bacterial strains causing bacteremia in 83 patients, enterococcal species were the most frequent organisms with 36 isolates (24.7%) compared to 29 (19.9%) S. aureus isolates. Table 1 delineates the organisms isolated from DLIs, both retrospective and prospective. In the prospective DLI samples, 96 strains were isolated from 54 unique VAD infections. S. aureus was the most common single organism in this cohort with 31 isolates (32.3%). When focusing on DLIs, the percentage of infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was similar in both the retrospective and prospective studies, P = 0.3. We isolated or evolved 93 bacteriophage able to lyse (kill) bacteria causing DLIs from the prospective study (24 gram-positive-killing phage and 69 gram-negative-killing phage).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

In this study, similar pathogens caused LVAD DLIs in our retrospective and prospective collections, implying that our prospectively created strain bank can be used to develop bacteriophage cocktails against future DLIs. Although the most common organism in both cohorts was S. aureus, we isolated the fewest phage against this pathogen. Future work will use DLI-sourced S. aureus as the host to isolate phage from S. aureus-rich environmental sources, such as human nares and wounds. As bacteriophage therapy becomes more established, we plan to use our bacteriophage bank to develop phage treatments tailored for the specific pathogens causing each patient&rsquo;s infection.

In the US, racial disparities in surgical treatment and outcomes have been widely documented. However, little is known about potential disparities among patients with EP.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Hospitalizations of adult (&ge;18 years old) patients diagnosed with EP were identified in the 2000-2017 National Inpatient Sample. Since several states do not report race hospitalizations, hospitalizations missing race were excluded (n=1,574 unweighted). Race was categorized as White, Black, Hispanic, and other race. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association between race and in-hospital&nbsp;mortality. Inpatient complications were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Survey-specific analysis methods were used to account for clustering and stratification, and analyses were weighted to obtain national estimates.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;There were 36,531 EP hospitalizations. One quarter of hospitalizations were among racial minorities (Black 13%, Hispanic 8%, other 5%). White patients were significantly older at admission (median age 58 vs. 41 and 47, p&lt;0.0001), and more likely to be transferred in from outside hospitals compared to Black and Hispanic patients (19% vs. 14% and 13%, p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.0003, respectively). The rate of EP admissions, per 1,000,000 US adults, significantly increased among all groups over time, Figure 1A.&nbsp;Similar rates of surgical intervention were seen among races, including esophageal stents. In-hospital mortality decreased for both White and Black (10.2% to 4.6% 8.3% to 4.9%) but increased for Hispanic and other races (2.9%&nbsp; to 4.7% and 3.4% to 6.9%), p&lt;0.0001 for all, Figure 1B. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, including income and hospital teaching status, there was no difference in in-hospital&nbsp;mortality among all racial groups. However, Black patients were more likely to have sepsis (OR 1.34, 95%CI 1.08, 1.66), and pneumonia (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.98, 1.63). Other race patients were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01, 2.07).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Rates of EP admissions have increased for all racial groups since 2000. Mortality rates have decreased among White and Black patients but have increased among Hispanic patients and other races. Despite similar rates of in-hospital mortality across groups, Black and other race patients were more likely to experience postoperative complications. This study suggests that potential disparities in quality or access to care exists among Black, Hispanic and other race patients that warrants future research.

Studies have shown improved outcomes among married patients with cardiovascular disease. However, the outcomes of marital status after the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has not been studied. We examined the impact of marital status and sex on post-discharge outcomes over the first year after TAVR. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients who underwent TAVR from January 2015 to June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed and stratified into 3 groups: Single (149), Married (413) and Widowed (223). The interaction of marital status and patient sex (male vs female), and postoperative outcomes (30-day mortality and home disposition) was assessed using a stepwise, selection logistic regression analysis. Cumulative survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and adjusted survival was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards modelling, stratified by marital status and patient sex. Median follow-up was 2.25 years.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Widowed patients were older than married patients (84 vs 79 years) with higher STS scores (6.79% vs 5.51%, both P&le;0.001). Neither marital status or sex was associated with 30-day mortality, home discharge or readmissions (all P&ge;0.2). However, Kaplan-Meier analysis of 1-year survival revealed a differential survival penalty for marital status in each sex. &nbsp;In women married status was associated with lower survival whereas in men widowed status was associated with lower survival (overall p=.017). &nbsp;This survival penalty persisted in the adjusted analyses (married women HR=2.24, P=0.009 and widowed men HR= 2.42, P=0.057), demonstrating that married status may not improve TAVR outcomes in both sexes as previously seen in the cardiovascular disease literature. For patients with readmissions during the first year (N=175), adjusted analysis showed widowed status was associated with higher 30-day readmissions (nearly 60% of readmissions, HR=1.91, P=0.012), regardless of sex (Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our findings raise concerns that marital status and sex may impact 1-year TAVR outcomes. Identifying at-risk individuals and targeted interventions, such as adjusting discharge planning to ensure adequate home social support, may help improve outcomes.&nbsp;

The present study aimed to examine the independent impact of anemia and blood transfusions on mortality and complications using a state-wide collaborative.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An academic health-system, statewide, cardiac surgery consortium repository was used to identify all adult patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) from 2013 to 2018. Preoperative anemia was defined as a hematocrit (HCT) level &le;30%, while those with missing HCT values were excluded. The administration of any packed red blood cells (pRBC) and blood component therapy (BCT) were studied as binary variables. Multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for patient and operative characteristics including age, gender, urgent/emergent operative status, hospital and year of operation were developed for 30-day mortality, postoperative stroke, and renal failure. The effect of preoperative anemia, pRBC transfusion, or BCT on each outcome was studied in these models. Model discrimination was evaluated using receiver-operating curve characteristics (AUC).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 2,778 patients who met study criteria (median age 64 years, Interquartile Range 57-71 years), 19.6% were female. Among the cohort, mortality was 2.7%, while postoperative stroke and renal failure incidence were 1.3% and 3.3%, respectively. The prevalence of preoperative anemia was 10.9%. Overall, 49% of patients received at least 1 unit of pRBC, while 58.1% were transfused at least 1 unit of BCT. Inclusion of pRBC and BCT within each established regression model resulted in greater odds of mortality and renal failure, but not stroke (Table 1). Furthermore, model discrimination for mortality and renal failure improved when adjusting for pRBC or BCT, as demonstrated by a greater AUC when compared to models that only adjusted for preoperative anemia (Table 1)


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Using a statewide cardiac surgery consortium we found red blood cell transfusion and other blood component therapy, but not preoperative anemia to be associated with higher odds of mortality and complications after isolated CABG. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between red cell transfusions and mortality irrespective of the presence of anemia. Therefore, ongoing efforts targeting reduction of packed red blood cell transfusion, but also blood component therapy, are needed.

Porterfield<sup>1</sup>, H. Chen<sup>1</sup>, B. Lindeman<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Same-day surgery in the carefully-selected patient decreases costs, improves inpatient capacity, and decreases patient exposure to hospital-acquired conditions. Outpatient adrenalectomy has been shown to be safe and effective, but patients&rsquo; perspectives have yet to be addressed. This study compares patient satisfaction following inpatient and outpatient adrenalectomy.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;An institutional database was queried for minimally-invasive adrenalectomies performed from 2017 to 2020. Patients were contacted up to two times to participate in a phone survey consisting of 25 questions modeled after the Outpatient and Ambulatory Surgery Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey (OAS CAHPS<sup>&reg;</sup>) assessing preparation for surgery, discharge experience, post-operative course, and overall satisfaction. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal Wallis, Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney, and Chi-square tests, as appropriate.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: One hundred five adrenalectomy patients were identified, of which 98 were contacted and 52 responded (53%). Outpatient adrenalectomy patients had slightly higher overall experience scores, but this difference was not statistically significant (9.17 &plusmn; 1.39 vs 8.57 &plusmn; 1.70, p=0.16). Patients undergoing outpatient adrenalectomy were more likely to have their discharge plan discussed pre-operatively (93% vs 63%, p=0.014), but no significant differences were noted between inpatient and outpatient groups regarding preparation for surgery, readiness for discharge, night of surgery experiences, or self-reported pain or complications (p&gt;0.05 for all). Significantly higher overall experience scores were reported by patients counseled about their discharge plan (9.31 vs 7.67, p=0.12), felt prepared for recovery (9.43 vs 5.5, p&lt;0.001), received information about pain control (9.13 vs 7.00, p=0.04), felt prepared at time of discharge (9.36 vs 5.80, p&lt;0.001), and received information about potential complications (9.30 vs 7.00, p=0.001). Outpatient adrenalectomy patients were significantly more likely to agree they would choose the same approach if facing surgery again (97% vs 83%, p&lt;0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patient satisfaction following adrenalectomy is significantly associated with patients&rsquo; self-reported degree of preparation for surgery and discharge, with no significant difference in patient satisfaction between inpatient and outpatient groups. Patients undergoing outpatient adrenalectomy would be likely to choose the same approach compared to inpatients. Targeted pre-operative counseling can contribute to enhanced patient outcomes for all patients undergoing adrenalectomy.

Milan<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Scott & White Healthcare,Department Of Surgery,Temple, Texas, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Persistent hypothyroidism has potential detrimental effects on physical and intellectual development in children. Appropriate management of postoperative thyroid hormone replacement is critical in pediatric patients following total thyroidectomy, yet a lack of postoperative literature exists in this population. We aimed to identify pediatric populations at-risk for persistent or recurrent hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single-center retrospective analysis included all pediatric total thyroidectomies from February 2002 to June 2019. Chart review determined age, sex, height, weight, pathology (benign versus differentiated thyroid malignancy), behavioral diagnosis (i.e. depression, attention deficit disorder), preoperative comorbidities, and number of daily preoperative medications. Patients were classified as child (&le;&nbsp; 12 years) or teen (&ge;&nbsp; 13 years). Body Mass Index Percentile (BMI%) was tabulated. Overweight (BMI% &gt;85%) and obese (BMI% &gt;95%) individuals were compared to all others. All Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels measured from discharge through age 18 were tabulated. Hypothyroidism was defined as a TSH greater than 4.0mU/L. A TSH-index variable accounted for varying follow-up intervals and frequency by dividing the total number of hypothyroid TSH values over the total number of TSH values. SAS 9.4 was used for all descriptive and logistic regression analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
50 patients (median age 14.5 years (Interquartile Range (IQR)=6)) were studied. 72% were female (n=36). 43% (n=21) were overweight or obese. Differentiated thyroid malignancy was detected on pathology in 20% of patients (papillary n=9, follicular n=1). A behavioral diagnosis was present in 22% of patients (n=11). The median number of preoperative daily medications was 2 (IQR=3). TSH levels were measured a median of 6.5 times (IQR=7) per patient. The TSH index was significantly higher in patients with 7 or more follow-ups (p=0.0195). There was no difference in TSH index when comparing sex (p = 0.4936), BMI percentile (p=0.9748), or age (p=0.9091). Hypothyroid TSH measurements were lower in malignant (39%) versus benign (45%) patients (p=0.3058). TSH measurements meeting hypothyroid criteria were higher in patients without a behavioral diagnosis (47%) versus those with a behavioral diagnosis (34%, p=0.4078). Increasing pre-operative home medication use and increasing pre-existent comorbidities were not associated with improved management of thyroid state.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Maintenance of appropriate pediatric thyroid hormone levels following total thyroidectomy is difficult to achieve irrespective of patient demographics, pathology, or comorbidities. Improving preoperative counseling and postoperative follow-up is warranted in these patients to prevent the detrimental sequelae of pediatric hypothyroidism. Future studies are needed to address this vulnerable postoperative population.

Postoperative opioid use may increase risk of overdose, misuse, and opioid use disorder. We recently implemented an opioid-free analgesic regimen following thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy, but patient satisfaction with pain control was unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate pain control and patient satisfaction using an opioid-free pain control regimen following thyroid and parathyroid operations.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Surveys were distributed to all postoperative patients following total thyroidectomy, thyroid lobectomy, and parathyroidectomy from 01/2020 through 4/2020 at their postoperative visit.&nbsp; After surgery, patients received no opioids except in rare cases based on patient needs and surgeon judgement.&nbsp; We measured patient reported pain scores using the Numeric Rating Scale and satisfaction using a 4-point Likert scale. Satisfaction ratings were categorized as either satisfied (happy or very happy) or dissatisfied (unhappy or very unhappy).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We received 90 of 198 surveys distributed, for a response rate of 45.45%.&nbsp; After excluding neck dissections (n=6) and preoperative opioid use (n=4), the final cohort included 80 patients after total thyroidectomy (26.3%), thyroid lobectomy (41.3%), and parathyroidectomy (32.5%). The majority were satisfied with their pain control (87.5%) and their entire surgical experience (95%). &nbsp;Patients who were satisfied with their pain control were more likely to be satisfied with their entire experience than those who were not satisfied with their pain control (97.1% vs 70.0%, p= 0.008). Only 6.3% of the entire cohort required opioid pain medication, and those who were satisfied with their pain control were less likely to require opioids postoperatively (2.9%) than those dissatisfied with pain control (30%, p=0.008). A similar proportion of patients reported being satisfied with pain control after total thyroidectomy (90.9%), thyroid lobectomy (90.5%), and parathyroidectomy (80.8%) indicating that the procedure did not significantly impact overall satisfaction with pain control (p=0.47).&nbsp; Additionally, patient reported pain scores were similar following the three operations at all time points (Figure).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Even with an opioid free postoperative pain regimen, the majority of patients are satisfied with their pain control after thyroid and parathyroid operations and most patients who were dissatisfied with their pain control reported satisfaction with their overall surgical experience.&nbsp; Taken together, these data indicate that an opioid free postoperative pain control regimen is well tolerated and unlikely to decrease overall patient satisfaction in this patient population.

Suliburk<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Department Of Surgery,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Neurocognitive symptoms are common in thyroid and parathyroid disease. The formal diagnosis and quantification of the extent of neurocognitive dysfunction can be challenging. The purpose of this project was to analyze the initial results from the routine implementation of neurocognitive testing in an endocrine surgery clinic of an academic medical center. We hypothesized that patients would demonstrate improvement in neurocognitive performance following successful surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single center prospective study was conducted over a 4-month time period at our institution&rsquo;s endocrine surgery clinic. We initiated routine neurocognitive testing including immediate and delayed recall (memory- IM, DM), Stroop test (executive function-&nbsp;EF), trail testing A and B (visual attention-&nbsp;VA), and Symbol Substitution test (cognitive performance- CP) in patients undergoing thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism or parathyroidectomy for primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism. All tests were administered using BrainCheck&trade;, a computerized cognitive assessment aid. Scores were collected and analyzed preoperatively and again after at least 2 weeks postoperatively.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
94 tests were administered in total. Pre-post test results were available for 36 parathyroid &amp; 8 thyroidectomy cases. Patients not receiving postop testing occurred as a result of declined follow up. Post-operative data showed 77.2% of all studied patients demonstrated improvement in at least 2 categories of neurocognitive performance. The most common area of improvement overall was in EF and VA where 62% of all patients experienced neurocognitive improvement in these two areas. 75% of patients undergoing parathyroidectomy had improvement in at least 2 neurocognitive performance categories with the most common area of improvement being CP and EF &amp; least common area IM. CP and EF both improved equally with 62% of parathyroidectomy patients experiencing improvement. All parathyroidectomy cases had intraoperative PTH measurement consistent with cure. All patients undergoing thyroidectomy had detectable PTH following surgery. Following surgery, 87.5% of patients who had undergone thyroidectomy experienced improvement in at least 2 neurocognitive measures. 75% of thyroidectomy patients demonstrated DM improvement.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The majority of patients experience improvements in neurocognitive performance after successful endocrine surgery. Routine neurocognitive testing facilitates the identification of patients who did not have neurocognitive benefits and thereby facilitates the referral of these patients for further neurocognitive rehabilitation. The demonstration of significant cognitive impairment prior to surgery and improvement after surgery in hyperthyroidism is a novel finding and represents an area for further investigation.

Prior studies have demonstrated a decrease in quality of life in these patients, however it is not known the extent to which this is attributable to financial toxicity. We sought to quantify and characterize patient-reported financial toxicity in patients with thyroid cancer at our institution.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;&nbsp;We identified patients within a clinical database who underwent thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer at our institution from 1990 to 2018. Patients were contacted by telephone to complete a questionnaire assessing financial toxicity and its related psychological financial hardship. Specifically, treatment costs, income loss, bankruptcy, debt, and job loss after their cancer diagnosis were explored. Our primary outcome was having negative financial consequences due to thyroid cancer diagnosis and treatment.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Respondents (n=147) were 73% female, 74% white, and had a mean age of 51. Half of all respondents reported an annual household income over $100k. The majority of respondents &nbsp;(82%) reported private health insurance, while 13% had Medicare and 5.5% were either on Medicaid or uninsured. &nbsp;A subset of patients (16%) reported having negative financial outcomes after their personal diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Respondents attributed this to income loss post-thyroidectomy (14%), debt (3%), and bankruptcy (1%). Many patients (40%) reported experiencing worry related to their medical costs. Financial impact was not found to be associated with age, sex, education, employment, or insurance status (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The majority of patients undergoing thyroidectomy for cancer at our institution are financially affluent, insured, and well-educated. However, despite this, 16% of patients report financial toxicity related to their thyroid cancer diagnosis and treatment. This burden is likely increased in a non-affluent population. Social determinants of health in the thyroid cancer patient population and their association with financial toxicity should be further studied as this burden likely contributes to a decrease in quality of life in thyroid cancer survivors.

Fazendin<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Parathyroidectomy is the standard management for patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism (THPT) and hypercalcemia. However, a subset of patients with THPT have normal or mildly-elevated serum calcium levels in the setting of significantly elevated PTH. Prolonged exposure to elevated PTH can have deleterious effects on bone health. Despite this, the role of parathyroidectomy in these patients has not been previously studied. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of parathyroidectomy in normocalcemic THPT.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A multicenter retrospective review of patients diagnosed with THPT who subsequently underwent four-gland exploration and subtotal parathyroidectomy between 2000-2019 was performed. Patients were categorized as &ldquo;normocalcemic THPT&rdquo; (Ca &lt; 10.4 mg/dL) or &ldquo;hypercalcemic THPT&rdquo; (Ca?&nbsp;10.4 mg/dL). Pre- and post-operative calcium and PTH levels, specimen weight, complications, evidence of biochemical cure, and disease recurrence were recorded. T-tests and chi-squared analysis was used, where appropriate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Two-hundred twenty-eight THPT patients were included with a mean age of 53 years and 57% female. Ninety-four (41.2%) were normocalcemic with a mean pre-operative Ca of 9.6&plusmn;0.1 mg/dL compared to&nbsp;11.2&plusmn;0.1 mg/dL in the hypercalcemic group (p=0.001). Pre-operative PTH levels were markedly higher in the normocalcemic group (449&plusmn;61 pg/dL) compared to the hypercalcemic group (294&plusmn;21 pg/dL; p=0.007). Post-operative Ca levels in the normocalcemic group were slightly lower, but not statistically significant (8.6&plusmn;0.1 mg/dL vs. 9.5&plusmn;0.6 mg/dL). Post-operative PTH levels were higher in the normocalcemic group 113&plusmn;14 pg/dL compared to the hypercalcemic group 78&plusmn;9 pg/dL (p=0.03). Despite the higher pre-operative PTH levels, normocalcemic patients had significantly smaller glands compared to hypercalcemic patients (973&plusmn;109 vs. 1,292&plusmn;96; p=0.03).Notably, there was no difference in length of stay (0.36 days vs. 0.51 days) or cure rate (99% vs. 100%) when comparing normocalcemic vs. hypercalcemic groups, respectively. Recurrence was lower in the normocalcemic group (4%) than hypercalcemic group (9%), although not statistically significant.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients with normocalcemic THPT undergoing parathyroidectomy have similar outcomes including cure and recurrence rates to those with hypercalcemic THPT. This data demonstrates that lowering the threshold for surgical intervention to include patients with mild THPT disease can be performed efficaciously, while shortening the duration and systemic impact of prolonged hyperparathyroidism.

Hemodynamic instability is a major challenge during adrenalectomy. We hypothesized that the prone jack-knife position for posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (PRA) is associated with greater intraoperative hypotension than transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (TPA). The aim of this study was to compare intraoperative hemodynamic parameters between PRA and TPA.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective study of patients undergoing PRA and TPA without conversion or concomitant intra-abdominal pathology from 2008 to 2019. The primary outcome was intraoperative hypotension defined by mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt;60 mm Hg or a need for &ge;2 intravenous vasopressors at least 30 minutes after anaesthetic induction.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Overall, 108 patients met the inclusion criteria; 33 (30.6%) had pheochromocytoma, 26 (24.1%) Conn&#39;s syndrome, 8 (7.4%) Cushing&rsquo;s disease, and 41 (38.0%) non-functioning adrenal tumours. Of these, 68 (63.0%) underwent PRA and 40 (37.0%) TPA. Age, sex, body mass index, pre-induction blood pressure (BP), number of pre-operative anti-hypertensives, and histopathological diagnosis were similar in the 2 groups. Tumour size was greater in the TPA group. The lowest MAPs of PRA patients were lower than TPA patients (Figure 1, P=0.04). Multivariate analysis showed PRA was more likely to be associated with a lowest MAP of &lt; 60 mmHg (OR 4.44, 95% CI 1.27-15.54, P=0.02), and a need for &ge;2 intravenous vasopressors (OR 5.44, 95% CI 1.52-19.46, P=0.009) compared with TPA. When pheochromocytoma patients were excluded from analysis, PRA patients were more likely to require &ge; 1 intravenous vasopressors (OR 21, 95%CI 4.61-96.65, P=0.001); but the risk of the lowest MAP being &lt; 60 mmHg was similar in both groups. PRA was associated with reduced operative time (P=0.01) and length of hospital stay (P=0.03) compared with TPA.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While PRA offers several advantages over TPA, it carries a greater risk of intraoperative hypotension. Both surgeons and anaesthetists should be aware of this association to minimize periods of hypotension, in order to avoid adverse outcomes. A larger multi-centre prospective trial is required to validate these findings.

To date, no study has assessed at the adequacy of prophylactic lymph node yield (LNY) necessary to accurately stage patients. Our aim was to determine the optimal LNY for pediatric patients undergoing thyroidectomy for clinically node-negative PTC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients aged &le;18 years with clinically node-negative PTC (cN0) who underwent thyroid surgery were reviewed in the National Cancer Database between 1998-2016. Patients who had &ge;1 LNY were compared to those that did not, using Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Comparisons were made based on demographic, clinical, and pathological characteristics. To estimate the number of lymph nodes needed for accurate pathologic nodal staging, a truncated beta-binomial distribution was used. LNY was calibrated to achieve 90% sensitivity in nodal staging, and model prediction was stratified to clinical tumor size staging, pT1-3.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1,948 children with cN0 disease were included; median age was 17 years; 83.2% were female. Preoperatively, 47.6% were clinical stage T1, 25.3% T2, and 9.3% T3. 1,272 (65.3%) had lymph nodes resected. Of the patients who had &ge;1 LNY, the median LNY was 5 nodes (interquartile range [IQR] 2-12); 45.9% of patients were found to have at least one metastatic lymph node. Compared to the patients without LNY, patients who had &ge;1 LNY removed were more likely to come from a household with higher annual income of &gt;$35,000 (73.1% vs 67.5%, p=0.009), more likely to undergo total thyroidectomy (93.6% vs 74.9%, p&lt;0.001) and more likely to receive post-operative radioiodine (56.8% vs 47.5%, p&lt;0.001). In the group that had&nbsp; &ge;1 LNY, probability of a falsely negative lymph node resection was 59% when a single node was examined, but reduced to &lt;10% when 12 lymph nodes (95% confidence interval [CI] 9-19) were examined. Based on clinical tumor T-stage, LNY for 90% sensitivity of finding a positive metastatic lymph node was 14 lymph nodes for T1, 8 for T2, and 6 for T3.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the first study to estimate the LNY necessary to accurately assess lymph node status in children with PTC who are cN0 in the preoperative setting. Our findings can guide judicious lymph node resections to optimize the LNY while being thoughtful about the potential risks of central lymph node resections in children. Adequate LNY for pediatric PTC patients is different from that of adult patients based on higher likelihood of lymph node metastasis in pediatric PTC.

Miller School Of Medicine,Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology has 6 diagnostic categories, each with an implied cancer risk. Bethesda III thyroid nodules have atypia or follicular lesions of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) on fine needle aspiration (FNA) and carry a rate of malignancy (ROM) between 5% to 15%. This presents a clinical dilemma regarding appropriate surgical management. Gene Expression Classifier (GEC) and Thyroid Genomic Classifier (TGC) molecular testing can further stratify AUS/FLUS nodules as suspicious or intermediate/high risk for thyroid cancer, respectively. This study investigates the utility of GEC and TGC tests in predicting malignancy in AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of prospectively collected data for 1457 patients with index thyroid nodules who underwent FNA and thyroidectomy from 2010 to 2020 at a single academic institution was performed. The use of GEC or TGC testing in patients with AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules that underwent initial thyroid surgery for definitive diagnosis was examined. GEC testing was reported as benign or suspicious for malignancy while TGC testing was reported on a spectrum of low, intermediate or high risk for malignancy. Positive TGC was separated into intermediate or high risk based on gene mutations or fusions. Descriptive statistics were utilized to compare the ROM among AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 1457 patients with FNA thyroid cytology, 358 (25%) corresponded to AUS/FLUS results. Most patients were women (83%, n=298), with a median age of 49 years (IQR: 40-59) and nodule size of 20 mm (IQR: 13-29). Sixty-nine percent of AUS/FLUS patients (n=247) underwent total thyroidectomy. Of this AUS/FLUS group, 132 (37%) had GEC testing, 88 (24%) had&nbsp;TGC testing and 139 (39%) had no additional molecular testing. Overall, 197 (55%) had thyroid malignancy on final histopathology. ROM for AUS/FLUS nodules with a suspicious GEC was 55% (71/128), whereas ROM for AUS/FLUS nodules without GEC or TGC testing was 49% (68/139). ROM for AUS/FLUS nodules with a positive TGC was 73% (n=48/66). Amongst these patients, 43 had intermediate-risk mutations (e.g. BRAF+), of which 60% were malignant, and 23 had high-risk mutations (e.g. TERT, RET, multiple mutations), of which 96% were malignant (p&lt;0.01).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Surgical patients with AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules have a high ROM. While high-risk TGC testing may have some utility in predicting malignancy in AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules, GEC and intermediate-risk TGC results have limited value. Surgeons should carefully consider the utility of molecular tests in determining the extent of thyroidectomy as it may lead to overtreatment and increased morbidity.

Procedure type was classified as lobectomy or less and sub-total/total thyroidectomy. Analysis was stratified staging of the primary tumor and size. Descriptive statistics were performed to illustrate patient and tumor characteristics as well as with chi-square analysis to evaluate frequency of treatment with total thyroidectomies versus lobectomy or less. Logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex, size of tumor, rural vs. urban institutions, and surgery year was conducted to identify factors predictive of procedure type.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;2,271 unique patients underwent surgical management of papillary thyroid cancer between 2006-2016. Most patients received a sub-total or total thyroidectomy as surgical management (N=2,085, 89.3%). 186 patients (8.19%) received a lobectomy or less. The number of lobectomies or less increased with time, with 41(6.7%) patients between 2006-2009, 98 (8.0%) between 2009-2015, and 47 (11.1%) between 2016-2017. Mortality rates were low (N = 15, 0.6%). On logistic regression analysis, later stages, larger sizes, and earlier operative years were predictive of a near-total or total thyroidectomy.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Despite the American Thyroid Association Guidelines recommending a total thyroidectomy for pediatric well-differentiated thyroid cancer, the results of this study demonstrate that thyroid lobectomies are being performed in increasing frequency for smaller tumors in earlier stages of disease. Further investigation of whether this trend actually affects the outcomes in this patient cohort is needed.&nbsp;

Chen<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Otolaryngology,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) remains a controversial intervention for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients in the absence of radiologic evidence of nodal metastasis (N0). Proponents state that pCND prevents recurrence, while opponents deem that the risks of complications outweigh any potential benefit. To this point, there are conflicting studies identifying the outcomes of pCND for PTC patients with N0 disease. Therefore, we performed an analysis of N0 PTC patients at our institution to determine the efficacy of pCND.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

An institutional cancer registry and supplemental electronic medical records (EMRS) were queried for patients who underwent thyroid surgery for papillary thyroid cancer with N0 staging as identified by preoperative imaging. Patients with PTC were then stratified by the presence or absence of a prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND). Standard statistical analyses was performed, such as ANOVA/t-test and chi-square, using Microsoft&reg; Excel&reg; PivotTable and IBM&reg; SPSS&reg; software to determine statistical significance in patient outcomes and complications based on the difference in their treatment protocol.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Between 1998 and 2018, 695 patients with PTC had thyroid surgery at our institution. Of these 695 patients, 492 (70.8%) had N0 disease. The mean age was 50&plusmn;1 years old and 368 (74.8%) were female. Of those with N0 disease, 61 patients (12.4%) underwent pCND. pCND patients were found to have higher pre-operation thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) values, 2.8&plusmn;0.8 vs. 1.5&plusmn;0.2 mU/L (P=.028), and had lower BMIs, 29&plusmn;0.9 vs. 31&plusmn;0.4 (P=.024).&nbsp;

No statistically significant difference was found between pCND and no pCND for recurrence/distant metastasis of disease (P=.105) or persistence of disease (P=.069) at time of follow-up (mean 38&plusmn;3 months). However, following surgery, pCND patients had a higher occurrence of transient hypocalcemia (36.1% vs.14.4%,&nbsp;P&lt;.001), transient recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury (19.7% vs. 7.0%,&nbsp;P&lt;.001), and permanent RLN injury (3.3% vs. 0.7%,&nbsp;P&lt;.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The majority of PTC patients at our institution with N0 disease did not undergo pCND. Those that did were characterized by higher pre-operation TSH values and had lower BMIs at the time of surgery. Additionally, pCND was associated with no improvement in outcome as measured by decreased recurrence or distant metastasis rates, but did result in increased post-operation complications. Therefore, we conclude that pCND should not be routinely performed for PTC patients with N0 disease.

Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels are used to monitor for thyroid cancer recurrence and have been correlated with post-treatment disease burden. However, the clinical significance of Tg in the preoperative setting to predict the risk of underlying differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is not clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim is to examine the clinical utility of preoperative Tg levels in those undergoing thyroidectomy for thyroid disease.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
From a prospectively collected database, we identified 1191 patients who underwent initial thyroidectomy from January 2014 to December 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who underwent thyroid resection for hyperparathyroidism (n=2), medullary thyroid cancer (n=3), anaplastic thyroid cancer (n=1), and lymphocytic thyroiditis (n=1) were excluded. Of the 1184 patients, one-third (n=385) had a preoperative Tg level. Data collected included demographics, preoperative Tg levels, operative indication, operation performed, and presence of DTC on final pathology. Preoperative Tg levels were compared across groups by preoperative indication for surgery (hyperthyroidism, nodular thyroid disease, and papillary thyroid cancer), highest Bethesda category of biopsied nodules, presence of DTC on surgical pathology, and number of metastatic lymph nodes. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of the 385 patients, 97 (25%) were male and the mean age was 50 &plusmn; 1 years. Patients underwent total thyroidectomy (n=306), thyroid lobectomy (n=78), thyroid isthmusectomy (n=1).&nbsp;&nbsp;Preoperative indications for operation included thyroid nodule (n=109), multinodular goiter (n=53), Graves&rsquo; Disease (n=44), PTC (n=163), or other benign disease (n=16).

&nbsp;

There was significant variation in preoperative Tg levels (mean 351&nbsp;+&nbsp;61). There was no difference in mean preoperative Tg level when compared across preoperative indication for surgery (p=0.209). Tg levels did not differ by nodule Bethesda classification (Table 1, p=0.392).&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean preoperative Tg levels were lower in patients with DTC (n=237, mean 238 &plusmn; 77) compared to those who did not have DTC (n=148, mean 532 &plusmn; 97) on final pathology (p=0.018).&nbsp;&nbsp;Among 188 DTC patients who had lymph nodes removed, there was no significant correlation between the preoperative Tg level and number of positive lymph nodes on final pathology (p=0.414).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Preoperative Tg levels were lower in patients with DTC compared to those with benign disease on final pathology and did not correlate with extent of lymph node metastasis in patients with DTC. We do not recommend using preoperative Tg levels to guide extent of surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer.

Although the majority of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are asymptomatic, increased bone turnover and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) increase the risk of debilitating fractures. The potential for improved BMD after parathyroidectomy (PTX) is often discussed but poorly understood. Elucidating the factors which predict change in BMD would allow physicians to better counsel patients about the risks and benefits of PTX. No studies to date have evaluated whether a relationship exists between preoperative imaging findings, such as gland size and&nbsp;Tc-99m Sestamibi (MIBI) uptake, and postoperative change in BMD. We hypothesized that larger, MIBI-avid glands would be associated with greater increase in BMD after curative PTX.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Retrospectively, patients with PHPT who underwent combined MIBI and 4D-CT (SPECT/CT)&nbsp;prior to PTX were considered for inclusion. Only patients with both preoperative and 1-year postoperative dual-energy&nbsp;x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at our institution were included to avoid potential disparity in measurements. From SPECT/CT, data were collected on each parathyroid gland including estimated weight (using the ellipsoid formula), MIBI uptake, and contrast enhancement. Total (4-gland) estimated parathyroid weight was calculated for each patient. Our primary endpoint was the percent&nbsp;change in BMD at the lumbar spine (LS). We evaluated all variables potentially related to bone metabolism along with the imaging variables and used stepwise regression to construct a multivariate&nbsp;model to predict the change in BMD.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

28 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 60.9 &plusmn; 12.4 y, 82% were female, 68%&nbsp;had a history of osteoporosis, and 36%&nbsp;had&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;2 abnormal glands. Median total parathyroid weight was 270 mg (range 66 &ndash; 2133), and 68% had MIBI-avid glands. Complete DXA data was available in 25 patients. All demonstrated biochemical cure (normalized serum calcium&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;6 months after PTX). An increase in BMD at the LS was observed in 76% of patients (mean change 2.4&nbsp;&plusmn; 4.3%). The change in BMD at the LS was best predicted by preoperative serum calcium, total estimated parathyroid weight, and MIBI uptake (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

To our knowledge, we are the first to report a relationship between preoperative imaging findings and bone recovery after PTX. The most logical explanation for our findings would be that larger, more metabolically active adenomas mobilize more calcium from bone. Subsequently, these patients may have greater potential for recovery of BMD after PTX. Despite our limited sample size, our preliminary findings add important insight into bone recovery after PTX and, if verified, may prove helpful when counseling patients regarding potential benefits of PTX.

Pre-operative alpha blockade with phenoxybenzamine has been the primary strategy used in PC patients, though its non-selective nature can result in significant side effects, especially for older patients, with costs significantly higher than selective agents. Here we examine various pre-operative treatment strategies used in PC patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective, single institution review of patients with resected PC from 1996 through 2020 was performed. Clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Special attention was given to determine specific pre-operative blockade strategy.&nbsp; Elderly patients were defined as 70 years or older at the time of resection.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;One hundred sixty-six patients underwent resection of a PC during the study period. Most patients were female (N=91, 55%) and Caucasian (N=95, 58%). The median age was 54 years (range, 18-93). The pre-operative blockade strategy could be determined for 165 patients. Most received phenoxybenzamine (N=90, 55%), followed by selective alpha-1 agents (N=40, 24%), and calcium channel blockers (N=11, 7%). No pre-operative blockade was employed in 24 cases (15%). There was no difference in phenoxybenzamine use based on race (Caucasian vs. Black: 54% vs 52%, P=0.87) or sex (female vs. male: 51% vs 56%, P=0.53). There also was no difference in use of selective alpha-1 agents based on race (Caucasian vs. Black: 19% vs. 28%, P=0.25) or sex (female vs. male: 24% vs. 19%, P=0.45). Twenty-three patients (14%) were elderly. Elderly patients had similar demographics as compared to their younger counterparts (Caucasian, elderly vs. younger: 72% vs. 56%, P=0.19; female,&nbsp;elderly vs. younger:&nbsp;48% vs. 56%, P=0.52). Elderly patients were less likely to receive phenoxybenzamine (59% vs. 26%, P=0.006) and more likely to get an alpha-1 selective agent (61% vs. 18%, P&lt;0.0001) compared to younger patients (see Figure). There was no difference in the use of calcium channel blockers (younger vs. elderly:&nbsp;7% vs. 13%, P=0.40) or no pre-operative blockade (younger vs. elderly: 15% vs. 9%, P=0.53) in the two age groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Elderly patients comprise a large cohort of PC patients. Selective alpha-1 agents were more likely to be used in this population.&nbsp; Given the equivalent therapeutic efficacy of these agents in managing hypertension in older PC patients, and the relatively higher cost and potentially worse side effects of phenoxybenzamine, pre-operative use of selective alpha-1 antagonists may be justified in all PC patients.&nbsp;

James<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,General Surgery,Boston, MA, USA <sup>2</sup>Harvard Medical School,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is a procedure involving simultaneous sampling of both adrenal veins to measure autonomous hormone production. AVS is routinely performed in hyperaldosteronism to differentiate adenoma from hyperplasia. AVS is not routine in the workup of adrenal Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome prior to surgical planning. We aim to assess whether AVS provides a significant benefit for treatment planning.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A search of patients with adrenal Cushing&#39;s whose workup included AVS revealed 8 patients at our institution from 2015 to 2020. 1 was lost to follow up after undergoing AVS. The remaining 7 patients were included for final analysis. Patients ranged from ages 37 to 75, 3 were male and 4 were female, and 5 were Caucasian and 2 were African American. Clinical improvement was defined as either reduced serum cortisol or symptomatic improvement, or both.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
AVS results were concordant with imaging results in 3 out of 7 (43%) patients and discordant in 4 out of 7 (57%). AVS changed management to medical therapy in 1 discordant case, confirmed management with ablation in 1 concordant case, and did not appear to affect management in 5 cases. Management consisted of unilateral adrenalectomy for 2 patients, radiofrequency ablation for 2 patients, and medical therapy for 2 patients. All 3 management strategies were employed in both concordant and discordant cases. Ultimately, 5 out of 7 patients had clinical improvement, 1 that underwent medical therapy is still being evaluated for response, 1 patient was lost to follow up after AVS. In 2 out of 4 discordant cases, AVS suggested bilateral disease while CT suggested unilateral disease.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The role of AVS in in adrenal Cushing&rsquo;s is still unclear. Our results suggest AVS&nbsp;may impact management in some patients. AVS results were discordant with CT results in over half our patient cohort, suggesting that basing management on cross sectional imaging alone may not be reliable. Indeterminate AVS results in 1 patient whose CT lateralized disease to the right side led to the decision for medical therapy instead of surgical. The decision was also influenced by the patient&rsquo;s mild symptoms. In an institution with AVS technical expertise, the procedure is low risk and may provide useful information. In patients with discordant results and more severe symptoms, surgery or radiofrequency ablation guided primarily by imaging was pursued. Interpretation of the AVS is nuanced and dependent on symptom severity, clarity of CT results, and discussion of options with the patient. The role of AVS needs to be studied in larger cohorts to decide whether it should routinely be adopted as a diagnostic tool in adrenal Cushing&rsquo;s.

Fazendin<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Albany Medical College,Department Of General Surgery,Albany, NY, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Surgery/ Division Of Breast And Endocrine Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The active form of vitamin D [1,25 (OH2D)] plays a key role in calcium homeostasis and ultimately the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Accepted dogma is that vitamin D (vit D) deficiency leads to a physiologic imbalance and resultant increased PTH secretion, rather than true autonomous gland dysfunction as seen in the majority of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) cases. The purpose of this study is to review final parathyroid pathology in relationship to preoperative vit D levels.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of all patients with pHPT who underwent parathyroidectomy by two surgeons from 2001 to 2019 was performed. Patients were stratified into 3 groups based on their preoperative vit D levels; &ldquo;low&rdquo; (&lt;20 ng/mL), &ldquo;low-normal&rdquo; (20-30 ng/mL), or &ldquo;normal&rdquo; (&gt;30 ng/mL). Patient demographics, pre- and postoperative labs, and final parathyroid pathology were reviewed and compared amongst groups. Statistical analysis was performed using T-test and Chi-squared analysis, as appropriate.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Two-thousand two-hundred thirty patients were included in the analysis, the majority of which were female (78.1%) with a mean age of 59 years. Groups were stratified according to vit D levels: &lt;20 (n=319), 20-30 (n=1,108), and &gt;30 (n=803). Among patients with low vit D levels, there was a higher rate of males (31%) compared to those with normal vit D levels (16%, p=0.008). Patients with low vit D also had significantly higher preoperative PTH levels (161&plusmn;9 pg/dL) compared to both the low-normal (128&plusmn;3 pg/dL) and normal groups (113&plusmn;5 pg/dL; p&lt;0.001). Similarly, postoperative PTH levels were higher in the low vit D group (63&plusmn;7 pg/dL) compared to low-normal (49&plusmn;1 pg/dL) and normal groups (49&plusmn;1 pg/dL; p&lt;0.001). There was no difference in pre- or postoperative Ca levels amongst the 3 groups. Notably, when comparing pathologic diagnoses, patients with low vit D levels had a significantly higher frequency of a single adenoma (71%) compared to normal vit D group (62%; p&lt;0.001). Hyperplastic glands were pathologically confirmed in fewer low vit D level patients (19%) compared to normal vit D level patients (25%).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:These large database retrospective results reveal a surprisingly increased association of low vit D levels with single-gland parathyroid disease instead of hyperplastic disease. Further investigation into the complex interplay between vit D levels and autonomous parathyroid function is warranted.

Most of the literature focused on postoperative outcomes are from single institutions. The purpose of this study was to describe the outcomes of adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma. We hypothesize that minimally invasive approaches would be associated with improved short-term outcomes, and similar oncologic efficacy.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients who underwent a resection for pheochromocytoma were identified in the National Cancer Database (2010 to 2016). Patients were categorized as minimally invasive adrenalectomy (MIA) or open adrenalectomy (OA). Short-term outcomes were compared, including positive margin, length of stay, unplanned 30-day readmission rate, and 90-day mortality rate. Long-term survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier estimate and a multivariable Cox model.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 888 patients with pheochromocytoma, 532 patients (60%) underwent an adrenalectomy. There was an even distribution of tumors based on laterality. 50.7% of patients underwent an OA, 35.9% were laparoscopic, 7.6% were robotic, and 5.8% required conversion. The proportion of MIA did not increase during the study period (coef 0.01, p=0.63). Patients receiving MIA and OA were similar, except those who underwent OA had larger tumors (median 8.3 cm) relative to MIA (4.8 cm, p&lt;0.001). Size was the only factor associated with MIA (relative to OA) in a multivariable model (OR 0.83, p&lt;0.001)&nbsp;

OA was associated with longer length of stay relative to MIA (6 vs 3 days, p&lt;0.001). There was no difference in the rates of positive margins (13.4% OA vs. 13.7% MIA, p=0.95), unplanned readmissions (4.3% vs. 2.2%, p=0.33), or 90-day mortalities (5.1% vs. 3.4%, p=0.60) based on operative approach. Median survival of all patients who underwent an adrenalectomy was approximately 12 years regardless of operative approach (p=0.23). For comparison, median survival of patients with a pheochromocytoma who did not undergo an adrenalectomy was 5.3 years. There was no association between overall survival and operative approach using a multivariable Cox analysis.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Among patients with pheochromocytoma, those with larger tumors were more likely to undergo an open adrenalectomy. With the exception of an increased length of stay, there were no differences in short- or long-term postoperative outcomes. These data suggest that tumor size and surgeon experience are the main drivers of operative approach. Surgeons may consider increased utilization of MIA, as over 50% of adrenalectomies in patients with pheochromocytomas&nbsp;are still being performed via an open approach.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Thirty patients were identified for inclusion, 25 (83.3%) with subtotal&nbsp;PTx&nbsp;and 5 (16.7%) with total&nbsp;PTx&nbsp;and reimplantation.&nbsp;There were no differences between the groups with regard to sex, ethnicity, preoperative serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH),&nbsp;or&nbsp;vitamin D.&nbsp;Patients undergoing total&nbsp;PTx&nbsp;with reimplantation had a greater difference in their intraoperative PTH levels from baseline to final&nbsp;2413pg/ml versus 1651pg/ml (p = 0.048)&nbsp;[Table 1]. There was no difference in&nbsp;parathyroid gland weight removed,&nbsp;length of stay, complication rate, recurrence, reoperation,&nbsp;mortality&nbsp;or transplant status.&nbsp;Patients with total&nbsp;PTx&nbsp;and reimplantation had significantly lower serum calcium levels on postoperative day 1&nbsp;with 7.22mg/dL versus 8.17mg/dL (p = 0.022)&nbsp;and were more likely to be readmitted with hungry bone syndrome&nbsp;with&nbsp;2 (8.6%) versus 3 (60%).&nbsp;In the subtotal&nbsp;PTx&nbsp;group,&nbsp;one patient had a myocardial infarction within 30 days of surgery and one patient had recurrence of SHP with PTH &gt; 800.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this cohort of patients subtotal and total&nbsp;PTx&nbsp;with reimplantation have similar outcomes for patients with SHP of renal origin, though total parathyroidectomy and reimplantation is associated with a higher rate of readmission for hungry bone syndrome.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Black patients often use underperforming hospitals for their surgical care. Hospital selection may play a critical role in surgical disparities. Given increased hospital consolidation into health networks, we evaluated surgical outcomes based on hospital network affiliation and compared the use of networked hospitals by Black relative to White patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database, we identified adult patients undergoing one of 10 operations in 10 states (2013-2016). Operations were classified as common: cholecystectomy, mastectomy, colon resection, inguinal femoral hernia, and small bowel resection or complex: esophagectomy, total gastrectomy, Whipple, hepatic lobectomy, and rectal resection. Hospitals were classified by network affiliation using the American Hospital Association survey. Hospitals were classified as non-networked (NNH), networked without a hub (NH-H) or with a hub (NH+H). The Hub Hospital (HH) was defined as the hospital that performed at least 75% of the total complex operations within a NH+H. Spoke hospitals represented the other hospitals within NH+H (SH).

Logistic regression with covariates for adjustment was used to evaluate the odds of death or serious morbidity (DSM) by hospital type. In separate models, we also examined the likelihood of Black patients selecting each hospital type. Within the NH+H, we also evaluated the outcomes at HH and SH hospitals.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Among 245,088 discharges, 123,087 (50.2%) occurred at NNH, 69,494 (28.4%) at a NH-H, and 52,507 (21.4%) at a NH+H. The overall rate of DSM was 15.1% with the highest percentage seen in NH-H (15.5%) and the lowest at NH+H (14.4%). Within NH+H, DSM was significantly lower at the HH than the SH (13.7% vs. 15.6%). The majority of Black patients were treated at NH (56.7%), with 37.7% treated at a NH+H. In unadjusted analysis, Black patients treated at a NH+H were more likely to be treated at SH than white patients (39.1% vs 35.0%).

After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no difference in DSM between NNH and NH. Within NH, the odds of DSM were significantly lower at NH+H relative to NH-H. Within NH+H, the odds of DSM were significantly lower at HH than SH. Black patients were more likely than White patients to use NH+H than NH-H. Black patients were less likely to use HH when compared to White patients. See Table 1.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Network affiliation alone does not confer a quality advantage. However, care at NH+H is associated with improved outcomes. Black patients more often selected NH+H but were more likely to use the SH, and therefore, did not get the quality advantage. Improving hospital selection and increasing HH use among Black patients may help eradicate disparities.

Yoo<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine,Department Of Surgery,New Haven, CT, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,Dallas, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Evidence-based guidelines recommend that post-operative inpatients who require no opioids in the final 24 hours of their hospital admission should not be prescribed opioids at discharge. However, we noted that at our large academic medical center, 59.4% of patients meeting the no-opioid criteria were discharged with a prescription for an opioid. We present here a quality improvement initiative directed at this potential source of excess opioid prescribing.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Over a 10-week pilot on two surgical inpatient units, a Best Practice Alert (BPA) was programmed in the electronic medical record. The BPA appeared when a provider attempted to sign a discharge prescription for an opioid for a patient who had not received opioids in the prior 24 hours. The provider could accept or disagree with the BPA; acceptance removed the opioid prescription while disagreement required typing a reason. Quantitative and qualitative data on providers&rsquo; interaction with the BPA was collected and summarized.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;

The BPA was seen by 41 different providers for 66 post-operative inpatients. The BPA was accepted in only 1 case, however that patient was ultimately discharged with a narcotic prescription from another provider. Reasons given for prescribing opioids largely fell into three categories (See Table):

1. General pain control (due to post-op status, admitting injury, or unspecified)

2. Anticipating increased pain at home due to increased mobility

3. Discontinuation of multimodal pain control that could not be continued at home

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;A targeted BPA, designed to decrease opioid prescriptions at discharge for post-operative patients requiring no &nbsp;opioids in the 24-hour pre-discharge period, did not appear to change prescriber behavior on its own. Current practice appears to be driven largely by beliefs that post-operative patients will have pain requiring opioids at home, either due to increased ambulation or merely due to their post-operative status. This suggests a need for additional prescriber education about the existing data and published guidelines that refute this belief. This study also identified that inpatients receiving multimodal pain control may represent a population for which these prescribing guidelines should be waived.

However, the number of surgeons pursuing basic science research has been declining over the past 20 years. We sought to describe perceived barriers to surgeons&rsquo; pursuit of basic science research and identify interventions to mitigate these obstacles.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An online convenience sample survey was sent to chairs of academic general surgery departments and practicing surgeons involved in basic science research identified by NIH funding, membership in the Society for University Surgeons, and involvement in the Association of Academic Surgery. A subset of participants were interviewed about their experiences. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and uploaded to NVivo. Two coders iteratively developed a codebook and co-coded the data using inductive content analysis to identify relevant themes. All authors were involved in the higher-level analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Ninety-seven people responded to the online survey; 27 (29%) were departmental chairs. The initial survey identified lack of funding, clinical duties and lack of dedicated time for research as major barriers to basic science research. Nine practicing surgeons who had participated in basic science research as attendings, two early-career (&lt;5y in practice), three mid-career (6-20y in practice), and four later career (&gt;20y in practice) surgeons as well as three departmental chairs were interviewed. A common theme from both practicing surgeons and chairs was that while not everyone who wants to pursue basic science research will or can be successful, cultivation of highly motivated surgeon scientists is possible and worthwhile. Approaches to maximize the success of surgeon scientists mentioned by both groups included the surgeon having clear goals and timetables with specific plans for attaining funding as well as having multiple mentors for different aspects of their careers. Applying for funding early and often as well as limiting additional clinical or administrative responsibilities were important actions surgeons could take. Chairs described the usefulness of embedding early surgeon scientists in their scientific mentors&rsquo; labs in a &ldquo;Post-Doc model&rdquo; to facilitate scientific success. Basic science research must be a priority of the department and included in departmental budgets for surgeon scientists to be successful. Department chairs and surgical administration also have to actively support surgeon scientists to protect themselves from encroaching clinical and administrative demands.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: While barriers to surgeons&rsquo; pursuit of basic science research exist, the surgeon scientist is a phenotype that can and should be fostered. &nbsp;Successful development of basic science surgeon researchers requires focused dedication and commitment from both the surgeon as well as departmental leadership.

Post-acute care represents an area of significant health expenditure for older adults, and a growing body of research is focused on anticipating those who will need it and exploring alternate strategies, such as home care. The role of informal caregiving for older adults, by friends and family, is well-described in those with chronic illness such as dementia and cancer, yet little is known about the role of social support on post-operative outcomes after routine surgical procedures. We hypothesized that older patients who lived at home with others would be more likely to be discharged home after surgery than those who lived alone.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Retrospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project that collected geriatric-specific data on patients from 33 hospitals between 2014-2018. Patients were included if&nbsp;65 years or older, were living at home prior to surgery, underwent general or vascular surgery procedure with length of stay greater than or equal to 3&nbsp;days and had known baseline functional status, living situation and discharge destination. The exposure of interest was living situation, defined as &ldquo;lives at home with support (family/friends)&rdquo; or &ldquo;lives at home alone.&rdquo; The primary outcome was discharge destination (home vs. post-acute care). Multivariate logistic regression adjusting for&nbsp;&nbsp;pre-operative variables (age, sex, BMI, history of falls, use of mobility aid, cognitive impairment, case type) was used to determine the association between living situation and discharge destination. A second regression model included both pre- and post-operative variables (loss of independence, defined as new need of mobility aid and/or decline in functional status, length of stay, and composite major complications).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
9,339 patients met inclusion criteria.&nbsp;The average age of the cohort was 74.3 years and 52% were male. One-quarter (25.1%) of patients lived alone at home prior to surgery. Patients who lived alone were more likely to be independent (p&lt;0.01). There was no difference in loss of independence after surgery. Nevertheless, patients who lived alone were more frequently discharged to post-acute care (20.2% vs. 10.7%, p&lt;0.01). In adjusted analysis, patients who lived alone were two times more likely to be discharged to a post-acute care facility,&nbsp;whether controlling for pre-operative variables only or both pre- and post-operative variables&nbsp;(OR 2.0, CI: 1.7-2.3, OR 2.4, CI: 2.0-2.8) (Table 1).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Living alone independently predicts discharge to post-acute care irrespective of postoperative functional status. These findings suggest that informal caregivers who live with older patients are providing post-acute care that is otherwise provided in facilities. More studies are needed to examine the impact of informal caregiving on outcomes and caregiver burden.

Factors such as economic conditions and unique social structure play a role in perpetuating these disparities. While prior studies have documented challenges in rural access to surgery, the beliefs, perceptions, and experiences of rural patients have not been well-studied. The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify factors contributing to surgical health disparities in rural areas by analyzing barriers to post-operative recovery and access to healthcare.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 30 adult participants from rural areas. Rurality was defined by Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes provided by the Rural Health Information Hub. All participants had recently undergone a general surgery operation. Interviews focused on participants&rsquo; experiences accessing healthcare and resources for postoperative recovery in a rural community, including the use of opioids for pain management. These interviews were completed within two months of surgery and lasted around 40 minutes. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded using content and thematic analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: All participants interviewed commented on the quality of healthcare in their respective areas. Some enjoyed the trust developed through long-standing relationships with providers in their communities; however, most reported that that their local healthcare systems lacked resources. Participants described a lack of money, equipment, and/or provider knowledge as barriers to care. Following surgery, most participants preferred family support over community support during recovery, and several participants preferred to recover without help from others. Some patients worried about being seen while experiencing their condition or disease, as well as being stigmatized for having a condition or disease, citing instances where people thought they were attention-seeking or even faking. Regarding opioids, several participants reported difficulty keeping pain medication private from their community. Participants described family members and friends requesting or stealing medication, and some even reported break-ins for theft of opioids.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Future interventions aimed at improving access to and recovery from surgery for rural patients should take into account the unique perspectives of rural patients and their communities. Addressing the socioecological factors surrounding rural surgery patients such as surgeons, family, and community resources, will be key to improving postoperative recovery, including improved opioid stewardship.

We hypothesized that rural Appalachian residents requiring emergency general surgery (EGS) would have more adverse SDH and worse outcomes compared to urban/suburban counterparts.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We prospectively enrolled patients (&gt;18) undergoing EGS at an urban quaternary care hospital in proximity to N. Central Appalachia. Sociodemographic characteristics (age, race, sex, education-level, insurance), psychosocial variables (social support, self-efficacy), and functional status (instrumental activities of daily living) seven days prior to presentation were assessed from patients/proxies. Length of stay (LOS) among survivors was recorded. Differences between Appalachian and urban/suburban Ohio residents were measured using appropriate tests of association.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Between September 2019 and July 2020, we enrolled 21 EGS patients from Appalachian and 33 from urban/suburban Ohio. Appalachian patients were more likely to be age &le;64 (89% vs. 59%, p=0.03), white (95% vs. 73%, p=0.03), and lacking college education (71% vs. 22%, p=0.02). Though not statistically significant, they were more often male (62% vs. 45%), Medicaid-insured (45% vs. 21%), and suffering NSTI (38% vs. 27%). Appalachian patients were somewhat more likely to have lower social support (42% vs. 16%, p=0.04), functional status (60% vs. 14%, p=0.06), and self-efficacy (50% vs. 16%, p=0.06).

Identifying those at highest risk for discharge to a post-acute care facility would improve postoperative planning and facilitate earlier discharge. We sought to examine the role of preoperative cognitive and functional status on discharge destination in older adults receiving emergency surgery. We hypothesize that preoperative mobility is most strongly associated with non-home discharge in older adults following emergency surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Using data collected from 33 hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project between 2014-2018, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine discharge destination in adults 65 years or older undergoing inpatient emergency surgery. Multivariate logistic regression determined the association between preoperative variables and discharge to a non-home destination (i.e., rehab facility, skilled care facility), with the inclusion of geriatric-specific variables (i.e, living situation prior to admission, cognitive impairment, consent signed by surrogate, fall within the past year, preoperative use of mobility aid, and preoperative functional status).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We included 3,494 patients, of whom 1,882 (53.9%) were discharged to a non-home destination. Patients discharged to post-acute care facilities were older (80.5 years vs 75.8 years, p&lt;0.0001) and more frequently ASA class 4 or 5 (31.9% vs 17.4%, p&lt;0.0001). In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, race, ASA, and BMI, fall within the past year was most strongly associated with non-home discharge (OR 5.3, 95% CI 4.4-6.5, c-statistic=0.81). Non-home discharge was also independently associated with partially dependent functional status before surgery (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.6) and preoperative use of a mobility aid (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.7-2.5) (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Fall within the past year, preoperative use of a mobility aid, and partially dependent functional status increase the risk of non-home discharge in older patients undergoing emergency surgery.

There is an increasing awareness of the negative financial consequences of surgical care on patients, often described in relation to out-of-pocket payments. However, the financial impact of surgery likely extends beyond direct payments, and may affect subsistence spending such as the ability to pay for food, housing, and other medical care. This study aims to quantify these broader financial consequences.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We analyzed a nationally representative sample of adults (age &gt;18 years) from 2014-2017 using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), an in-person cross-sectional household survey. Patients who reported undergoing surgery in the past 12 months were compared to those who did not. We evaluated for differences in medical debt and measures related to subsistence spending. We used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for age, gender, race, employment status, income, education, marital status, number of dependents, insurance type, region, number of hospitalizations, and year. A subgroup analysis of surgical patients aged 18-64 years was performed to evaluate the financial outcomes by insurance coverage.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The NHIS included 130,163 respondents in the adult sample (weighted 423 million), 16,717 (13%) of whom reported having surgery in the past year (weighted 53 million). Compared to the non-surgical cohort, risk-adjusted analyses revealed that surgical patients were more likely to report problems paying medical bills, delaying medical care due to cost, and altering medication doses to save money; as well as worry about running out of food each month and paying for housing (Table). Compared to privately insured nonelderly adults, those with Medicaid were less likely to report problems paying medical bills (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.6 (95% CI 0.5-0.7)), while uninsured patients were more than twice as likely to do so (aOR of 2.6 (95% CI 2.0-3.3)).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Nearly one in five surgical patients report problems paying medical bills. Moreover, surgery is associated with significant long-term financial consequences that extend beyond payment for the operation. The results of this nationally representative survey demonstrate that those who undergo surgery within the past year are at an increased risk of reporting difficulty with subsistence spending, controlling for demographics and number of hospitalizations. Insurance coverage appears to provide some risk protection among surgical patients, however privately insured nonelderly adults report worse financial toxicity than those enrolled in Medicaid. Improving financial risk protection after surgery should be a policy priority to mitigate the financial toxicity which may have a long-lasting and far-reaching impact on patients&rsquo; lives.

It is a common misconception that elderly patients experience pain as part of the aging process, which may lead to undertreatment of pain. There is a lack of consensus regarding ideal postoperative pain control measures, and opioid prescription patterns in elderly patients undergoing general surgery are not well characterized. The purpose of this study is to identify trends in postoperative opioid prescriptions in geriatric patients following common general surgery procedures and determine differences between opioid prescribing in geriatric and non-geriatric patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We retrospectively evaluated non-geriatric patients (18 to 64 years of age) and geriatric patients (greater than 65 years of age) undergoing the most frequently performed open and laparoscopic general surgery procedures at our institution from 2014 to 2019. Postoperative opioid prescriptions were quantified as milligrams (mg) of oxycodone for standardization. Differences in opioid prescriptions by age group and year of surgery were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests. Univariate and multivariate ordinal regression analyses were also completed to evaluate predictors of opioid prescribing in the geriatric population.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Using the Institutional Data Warehouse, we identified 7,195 non-geriatric and 4,054 geriatrics patients who underwent the included procedures at our institution. Of those patients, 6,318 (87.8% of non-geriatric patients) and 3,122 (77.0% of geriatric patients) received a perioperative opioid prescription. Geriatric patients were significantly less likely to receive an opioid prescription (p&lt;0.001), but amongst those who received opioids, the amount prescribed did not vary significantly between geriatric and non-geriatric patients (p=0.558). Within the geriatric population, pairwise comparisons between older and younger geriatric patients showed that prescription amounts were significantly higher in patients aged 65-74 (145 mg &plusmn; 72.3, Mean &plusmn; SD) compared to patients aged 75-85 (138 mg &plusmn; 56.3, p=0.006), and 85 or older (134 mg &plusmn; 56.7, p=0.002). Compared to 2019, the amount prescribed in the geriatric population decreased significantly each year between 2014-2019 (p&lt;0.001). Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that male gender (p&lt;0.001), younger age (p&lt;0.001), length of stay greater than four days (p=0.035), and open procedures (p=0.025) predicted higher prescription amounts in the geriatric population.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Reduced opioid prescription over time in the geriatric population reflect trends seen in the non-geriatric adult population, likely as a result of the opioid epidemic. Postoperative opioid prescribing patterns differ in geriatric and non-geriatric patient populations, and warrant further investigation.

Delays in obtaining medical care lead to increased rates of perforated appendicitis, increasing risk of morbidity and mortality. We previously explored the role of social determinants in patients undergoing cholecystectomy, finding that emergent presentation and more complicated disease are&nbsp;associated with disparities in both individual patient factors and neighborhood social vulnerability index (SVI). We hypothesize that social determinants also account for&nbsp;increased incidence of perforated appendicitis.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We retrospectively identified patients presenting to our urban, academic hospital with acute appendicitis during a 9-month timeframe (11/2019 &ndash; 7/2020), extracting demographics, diagnostic findings, and treatment from our electronic medical record. Patients were classified as perforated or non-perforated and assigned a grade per the AAST grading system to further define&nbsp;disease severity. For patients with multiple presentations managed non-operatively during, only the index presentation was used. Neighborhood SVI for patients was determined using geocoding at the census tract level.&nbsp;Because rates of perforation were higher in older patients, we performed a subset analysis of patients&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;40 years.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;202 patients were treated for appendicitis; of these, 190 patients had an in-state address that could be geocoded and were included in analysis. Patients with perforated appendicitis (n=48, 25%) were older and were more likely to initially present to a clinic versus the ED (p=0.009). Perforated patients also had longer delay before seeking care (56% vs. 6% with &gt;72 hours of symptoms, p&lt;0.001). However, there were no differences between groups in terms of sex, race/ethnicity, insurance type, language barrier, having a primary care physician, or any of the SVI subscales. There were also no differences in these social determinants according to AAST severity. Of patients&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;40 years, a higher proportion were perforated (28/80, 35%) despite similar rates of delayed care. In this cohort, higher overall SVI as well as the socioeconomic status&nbsp;and household composition/disability subscales were associated with higher risk of perforation.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Contrary to our hypothesis, while perforation was associated with delayed care in this population, we did not find overall that social vulnerability or individual social determinants accounted for this delay. In contrast to our previous study of cholecystectomy, appendectomy does not have an elective component for the index case, thus delays in care for truly emergent surgical disease appear to be related to disease presentation rather than systemic disparities.

Therefore, we sought to develop a predictive algorithm to classify appendectomy cases that are high risk of appendiceal cancer.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We developed a predictive model utilizing the American College of Surgeons Appendectomy Procedure Targeted NSQIP data for patients with acute appendicitis between 2016-2017. Patient characteristics and pre-operative factors were identified as candidate predictors. A subset of predictors was selected using regularized logistic regression, applying the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) to minimize prediction error. Discrimination and calibration were assessed using 200 bootstrapped samples. To explore temporal generalizability, we refit the model using only 2016 data and assessed validity in 2017 data.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 24,438 patients who had pathology proven appendicitis, 381 (1.6%) had appendiceal cancer. The Lasso model selected Age and WBC as predictors, which were fit to develop a percent risk nomogram (Figure 1). The prediction model resulted in an index-corrected c-statistic of 0.75 and near-perfect calibration slope (~1.00). Classification of high risk was based on a threshold value using Youden&rsquo;s index of 0.02, which balances false positive and true positive rates. In the 2017 data, the c-statistic increased to 0.76, while the calibration slope increased to 1.09.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Predictive modeling allowed for the development of a tool to identify patients at risk for appendiceal cancer using only Age and WBC with satisfactory discrimination. The nomogram is a practical tool that may assist in clinical decision making.&nbsp;

To prevent excessive prescribing, California implemented CURES (Controlled Substance Utilization, Review and Evaluation System) program, which restricts new opioid prescriptions. To combat opioid prescribing variability, our institution developed prescribing guidelines. This study aimed to investigate outcomes associated with both CURES implementation and our institutional guidelines on opioid prescribing practices.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We compared opioid prescribing at discharge from surgery at our institution for 3 periods: Jan-Mar 2018 (pre-CURES), Jan-Mar 2019 (post-CURES/pre-Intervention), and Jan-Mar 2020 (post-Intervention) across 4 procedures. We investigated the number and type of opioids prescribed, oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) at discharge, prescribing of adjuncts, and change in outpatient refill requests. For the post-intervention period, we conducted a mixed-methods patient survey to further assess patient satisfaction concerning pain management.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Comparing pre-CURES (n=93) with post-CURES (n=110), we identified a significant decrease in mean opioid tabs prescribed (24.5, SD 7.7 vs. 15.0, SD 7.2, p&lt;0.001) and mean OME dosage (153.6, SD 98.4 vs. 100.0, SD 55.3, p &lt;0.001) at discharge. After our institutional intervention (n=144), there was a significant decrease in mean number of tabs prescribed (15.0, SD 7.2&nbsp; vs 10.0, SD 4.6, p &lt;0.001) and in mean OME dosage prescribed and variability (100.0, SD 55.3 vs. 96.6, SD 34.8, p=0.04). Mean post-intervention prescribing achieved the recommended number of tabs (10 tabs). The number of refills did not differ significantly between any of the 3 periods. Patient survey results (n=62; 60% response rate) found that 88.7% of patients reported their pain was sufficiently controlled following surgery. 56.7% of patients reported having leftover opioids and 95.2% of patients felt they did not need an opioid refill. Qualitative responses indicate lack of knowledge of opioid disposal and lack of desire to use opioids for pain management.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Formalized opioid-prescribing guidelines and statewide prescribing regulations can significantly decrease postoperative opioids while maintaining patient satisfaction. These findings support data from other specialties that reductions in opioid use are not associated with changes in pain scores. Surgeon education may further minimize narcotic over-prescription without compromising pain management and reduce the number of circulating opioids among the population at large.

Benharash<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - Los Angeles,Division Of Cardiac Surgery,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) are considered surgical emergencies requiring prompt multimodal therapy in order to reduce extensive tissue necrosis and systemic illness. Studies have demonstrated inferior clinical outcomes at hospitals with a high burden of underinsured patients (safety-net) for a multitude of complex conditions. The present study examined trends, clinical outcomes, and resource utilization in the surgical management of NSTIs with a focus on hospitals considered safety-net. We hypothesized safety-net status to be associated with increased mortality, costs, and duration of hospitalization (LOS).
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

All adults admitted for NSTI (necrotizing fasciitis, gas gangrene, or Fournier&rsquo;s gangrene) who underwent operative debridement or major amputation were identified in the 2005-&rsquo;17 National Inpatient Sample. Major amputation was defined if proximal to the tarsometatarsal or metacarpophalangeal joints. Institutions were classified as low- (LBH), medium-, and high- (HBH) burden tertiles based on the institutional proportion of uninsured or Medicaid patients with HBH considered safety-net. Nonparametric tests were used to examine temporal trends while chi-square and adjusted Wald tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were developed to evaluate the association of HBH with odds of mortality, costs, and LOS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of an estimated 51,339 patients included for analysis, 18,096 (35.2%) were treated at HBH and16,384 (31.9%) at LBH. During the study period, NSTI associated mortality decreased at both LBH (8.1&nbsp;to 7.3%, NPtrend=0.019) and HBH (7.9 to 7.0%, NPtrend=0.002). Compared to LBH, patients treated at HBH had a similar burden of comorbidities as measured by the Elixhauser Index (P=0.21) but were younger (53.6 &plusmn; 15.0 vs 57.6 &plusmn; 15.3 years, P&lt;0.001), more likely to be Hispanic (15.8 vs 9.5%, P&lt;0.001) and belong to the lowest income quartile (40.4 vs 32.5%, P&lt;0.001). While unadjusted mortality rates were similar at LBH and HBH, those treated at HBH had a longer LOS and higher costs (Table). After adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, HBH status was associated with increased odds of mortality, greater LOS, and costs.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:


Despite an increase in NSTIs nationally with concomitant improvement in mortality, safety-net status was associated with increased mortality and greater resource use. Variation in access to care, disease presentation and timeliness of operative intervention may explain the observed findings. Efforts to improve access to care and increase hospital resources at HBHs may serve to improve quality of care for patients care treated at such facilities.

Horizontal integration across hospitals results in the formation of hospital systems. This phenomenon&nbsp;has taken many forms including the &ldquo;Hub and Spoke&rdquo; model which has particular importance in surgery. This design establishes a dominant hospital, the Hub (HH), where the majority of specialized care is delivered, and &ldquo;feeder&rdquo; spoke hospitals (SH). The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of hospital network formation via the costs of care at HH and SH within systems.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Using discharge data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project&nbsp;State Inpatient Database linked to the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey (2013-2016) across 10 diverse states, adult patients who underwent a common or complex general surgery operation were selected for inclusion. Hospital system affiliations were defined using the AHA. A hospital performing at least 75% of complex cases within a system was designated as a HH; otherwise the hospital was labeled SH. Wage index adjusted hospital costs were calculated in 2016 US dollars using Cost-to-Charge Ratios. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine mean costs with adjustment for patient characteristics and&nbsp;hospital setting. Subset analysis for common and complex operations was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Among 122,001 patients, 69,494 were treated in systems without a HH (57%), and 52,507 in systems affiliated with a HH (43%). Of the 52,507 treated in systems with a HH, 34,134 (65%) were treated in HH and 18,373 (35%) in SH. Differences in hospital characteristics are displayed in Table 1.

The adjusted cost at hospitals within systems with a HH was $2,188 (95% CI, $2,041 - $2,363) more than that of hospitals within systems without a HH. When comparing HH to SH, the adjusted cost difference was $790 (95% CI, $573 &ndash; $1,006) greater at the HH. Common operations were less costly at systems without a HH, and when performed in SH compared to HH. The adjusted cost of complex operations at hospitals within systems with a HH was $2,463 (95% CI, $1,717 - $3,209) more than that of hospitals within systems without a HH. The adjusted cost difference for complex operations was $1,164 (95% CI, $123 &ndash; $2,204) less at the HH compared to the SH.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The major difference between systems with and without a HH is the inclusion of hospitals with a medical school affiliation. These hospitals almost always represent the HH which are often larger than the SH, and perform the majority of the complex operations. &nbsp;Overall costs are greater at systems with a HH and within the HH except for complex operations which cost less at the HH. Systems should consider shifting common cases to the SH in order to reduce the overall cost of surgical care.

Effective SCs are engaged QI leaders who interface with frontline staff, hospital leadership, and stakeholders to facilitate QI initiatives. The Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement Collaborative (ISQIC) is a comprehensive, multi-component statewide collaborative designed to aid hospitals with surgical QI. ISQIC includes strategies to target SC development: mentorship, coaching, formal QI training, and encouraging leadership engagement. This study aims to examine how ISQIC participation affects perceptions of SC effectiveness.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A modified Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was administered in 2015 (baseline) and 2017 to hospital administrators, nurses and surgeons from 36 ISQIC hospitals. SC-focused questions in the SAQ evaluated perceptions of respect for the SC, the SC&rsquo;s ability to lead, motivate, and communicate feedback, and overall QI effectiveness. Percent positive response was calculated for each question; change in percent positive response to each question between the 2015 and 2017 surveys was compared with t-tests. Hospitals were then stratified into quartiles based on overall baseline percent positive response and t-tests were used to compare within-quartile changes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The response rate was 42.0% (N=1,046, 45.0% in 2015, 38.6% in 2017). Overall, there was significant improvement between 2015 and 2017 in positive responses regarding the SC&rsquo;s ability to communicate feedback (65.6% vs. 75.4%, p=0.012) and surgeons participating in QI initiative design (69.1% vs. 77.9%, p=0.036). There were no changes observed regarding perceptions of SC motivation, leadership ability, effectiveness, and respect for the SC. However, when hospitals were stratified by SC-focused baseline scores, hospitals with the lowest baseline scores (quartile 1) demonstrated significant improvement in respect for the SC (p=0.03), the SC&rsquo;s leadership ability (p=0.01), perceived QI effectiveness (p=0.02), and ability to communicate feedback (p=0.01; Table 1). There were no significant improvements observed in any SC-focused questions in hospitals with the highest SC-focused baseline scores (quartile 4).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Participation in a statewide collaborative with strategies focused on SC development led to positive changes in perceptions of SC effectiveness. Improvements were most pronounced in hospitals with the lowest baseline perceptions of SC effectiveness. These findings suggest strategies focused on developing and supporting SCs can improve their effectiveness. Further research is needed to examine if improved perceptions of SC effectiveness lead to improved patient outcomes.

Svoboda<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Sinai Hospital of Baltimore,Surgery,Baltimore, MD, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Maryland,Department Of Family And Community Medicine,Baltimore, MD, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Previous studies have shown that discharging older individuals to rehabilitation facilities is associated with adverse outcomes, including readmission or increased mortality rate. With increased operations performed in the geriatric population, our study aims to identify factors that are associated with patient discharge to non-home locations. Since pre-operative functional status has been shown to be an important factor impacting patient outcome, we hypothesized that this would be associated with patient disposition to non-home locations.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective analysis was performed using data from the 2013-2018 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, including targeted variables from the Geriatric Pilot Project. Patients age 65 and older in 33 institutions across the nation were included. We excluded patients who expired (n=580), left against medical advice (n=6), went into hospice (n=97), or had an unknown destination (n= 48) or unskilled facility (n=20). Pre-operative functional status was categorized as independent, partially dependent, and dependent. The primary outcome was home versus non-home. Non-home was defined as rehabilitation facility and skilled nursing home. Descriptive analyses were performed. Variables associated with postoperative discharge to non-home were identified with co-variate adjusted logistic regression modeling.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 44,199 patients were included. The largest percentage of operations were orthopedics (40.8%), followed by general surgery (29.2%), and vascular operations (10.0%). The majority of the patients were independent before operations (93.1%; 6% were partially dependent, 0.9% were totally dependent). In covariate-adjusted regression analyses, patients who were partially independent pre-operatively had 5 times higher odds of discharging to non-home, compared to patients who were independent (OR 5.03, p&lt;0.01). Similarly, patients who were totally dependent had 3.2 higher odds of discharging to non-home than patients who were independent (OR 3.23, p&lt;0.01). Black patients had 40% higher chance of discharging to non-home compared to white patients, even adjusting for comorbidities (OR 1.38, p&lt;0.01).

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Better pre-operative functional status is associated with patient discharge to home in older adults. Pre-operative interventions aim at improving functional status, such as prehabilitation, may be beneficial in improving patient outcomes.

There is an increasing emphasis on improving outcomes for surgical patients; unfortunately, there is no consensus on how to ensure the best possible outcomes in patients with comorbid conditions and complex social needs. This study examines the effect of a multidisciplinary preoperative&nbsp;program on postoperative outcomes. We hypothesized that a multidisciplinary preoperative&nbsp;program for high risk&nbsp;patients may reduce complications, readmissions, as well as hospital and intensive care unit length of stay.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This was a retrospective review of patients who underwent a general surgery operation from 2016-2017. Our variable of interest was enrollment into a preoperative multidisciplinary program (Maximizing your success after surgery (MAX) program). Patients identified as high risk&nbsp;could be referred by their surgeon. The program included a visit with a nurse to discuss improving activity, nutrition, and mindfulness, as well as to identify potential areas that could be preoperatively optimized. Additional criteria were used to refer patients to geriatrics or hospitalist&nbsp;medicine if necessary. We used chart review to identify postoperative complications, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, and emergency department visits up to 90 days postoperatively. All analyses were performed using Stata 15.1.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We included 281 patients who underwent bariatric, colorectal, hernia, endocrine, and hepatobiliary surgeries, with 96 (34.1%) enrolled in the Max program. There was no difference in median age (61 years in the Max program vs 60 years, p=0.4). There was also no difference in sex, race/ethnicity, American Society of Anesthesiology class, or comorbid conditions, except that patients in the Max program were more likely to be immunosuppressed (4.2% vs 0.5%, p=0.03). There was no difference in complications (33.3% vs 37.9%, p=0.5), emergency department visits (21.9% vs 22.7%, p=0.9), hospitalization length (4.8 vs 4.5 days, p=0.9), or the number of days in the intensive care unit (0.8 vs 0.4, p=0.9). However, when only patients&nbsp;&ge;65 years (n=102) were included, the risk of any 30-day morbidity was lower in patients in the Max program (33.3% vs 55.6%, p=0.02).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This review found that patients&nbsp;&ge;65 years enrolled in the Max program had a lower complication rate than those not enrolled in the program. As we developed the program, we encountered multiple obstacles such as poor communication between outpatient and inpatient members of the healthcare team and varying degrees of utilization of the program among staff surgeons despite encouraging broad referral. It is also important to note&nbsp;that there may be additional benefits such as patient satisfaction or time to return to baseline that could not be assessed in this review. Further research is needed to identify the patients that will benefit most from a structured, preoperative optimization program and how to best&nbsp;implement the program into routine practice.&nbsp;

While obesity has shown to be a risk factor for poor post-operative outcomes following elective and emergent general surgical procedures, little is known about the influence of having a low body mass index (i.e. &lt;18.5 and/or underweight) on outcomes following emergent general surgery in geriatric individuals. Understanding the association between being underweight and complications will be essential in promoting need for peri-operative medical optimization in geriatric individuals, where a low BMI is a common occurrence.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The 2011 to 2017 American College of Surgeons &ndash; National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried using Current Procedural Terminology codes to identify geriatric individuals (i.e. age &ge;65 years) undergoing an emergent general surgical procedure. Only individuals who had a concurrent &ldquo;emergent&rdquo; surgical code, and had undergone surgery within 48 hours of admission were included in the cohort. Patients were divided into 6 distinct groups based on their BMI: Normal (18.5-24.9), Underweight (&lt;18.5), Overweight (25.0-29.9), Obese Class I (30-34.9), Obese Class II (&ge;35) and unknown. Multi-variate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the influence of BMI level on rates of 30-day complications, failure-to-rescue, readmissions, re-operations and mortality, while controlling for age, gender, race, co-morbidities, frailty level (assessed using the modified 5-item frailty index), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, pre-operative nutritional status (using serum albumin level), total operative time and high vs. low risk surgery.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 47,216 patients were included &ndash; out of which 3,510 (7.4%) were underweight (i.e. BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Patients who were underweight (vs. normal BMI) had higher odds of experiencing any complication (OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.02-1.21]; p=0.014), pneumonia (OR 1.20 [95% CI 1.05-1.37]; p=0.006), unplanned intubations (OR 1.20 [95% CI 1.03-1.41]; p=0.024), post-operative ventilator use (OR 1.36 [95% CI 1.01-1.29]; p=0.048], cardiac arrest (OR 1.27 [95% CI 1.01-1.61]; p=0.045), failure-to-rescue (OR 1.31 [95% CI 1.16-1.48]; p&lt;0.001) and all-cause mortality (OR 1.41 [95% CI 1.26-1.59; p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Underweight geriatric patients appear to be at a higher risk of experiencing post-operative morbidity and mortality following emergency general surgery, even after controlling for frailty level and pre-operative nutritional status. These findings highlight the importance of carefully optimizing underweight elderly individuals who are undergoing an emergent general surgical procedure in order to mitigate the risk of experiencing deadly adverse events.

We evaluated a multi-institutional cohort of infants with asymptomatic CLMs to determine the causal effect of operative approach on surgical outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;After central reliance IRB approval, a retrospective cohort study was conducted on infants with resected asymptomatic CLMs at major children&rsquo;s hospitals (n=11) over a seven-year period. Frequency and central tendency trends between member hospitals based on operative approach and case volume were examined. Elective cases were stratified by thoracoscopic or open lobectomy and balanced on preoperative covariates using propensity scores with full matching. Outcomes including operative time, length of stay (LOS), and postoperative complications were then analyzed with weighted multivariate regression on the matched dataset. The sensitivity of causal inferences to unobserved confounding was assessed using E-values.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;One hundred seventy-five infants met inclusion criteria and underwent 67 (38.3%) open, 89 (50.9%) thoracoscopic, and 19 (10.9%) thoracoscopic-converted-to-open lobectomies. The median case volume per hospital was 11 cases (range, 3-32 cases). Seven (63.6%) centers completed more than 60% of elective lobectomies thoracoscopically. The mean operative time was 199 &plusmn; 6.5 minutes, and median hospital length of stay was 3 days (range, 0-24 days). The composite postoperative complication rate was 18.2%. After matching and adjusting for confounders, thoracoscopic lobectomies had significantly longer operative times (26 minutes, 95% CI 6-47 minutes, p=0.012) but used less epidural anesthesia (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.11, p&lt;0.001) than open resections. There were no significant differences in LOS or postoperative complications between thoracoscopic and open lobectomies. There was a trend towards fewer postoperative pneumothoraces with thoracoscopic resections, but this did not meet statistical significance (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-1.03, p=0.055). Sensitivity analyses showed it would take strong unmeasured confounding to negate the significant associations found in this study.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;In this multi-institutional study, thoracoscopy has become the predominant approach for elective CLM lobectomies in infants. Comparing thoracoscopic to open resections, propensity score matching revealed no overall difference in short-term postoperative outcomes.

Laparoscopic guidance may be useful to identify both a safe window of entry into the peritoneal cavity and an area with minimal adhesions for optimal CSF drainage. The purpose of this study was to compare laparoscopic-assisted VPS placement to the traditional &ldquo;open&rdquo; approach in patients with prior abdominal surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A single-institution chart review was performed of patients undergoing VPS placement into a reoperative abdomen from June 2009 to November 2019 at a free-standing children&rsquo;s hospital. Demographic and perioperative data were collected, and patients undergoing laparoscopy (LAP) were compared to those treated with an open approach (OPEN).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 120 children underwent 169 VPS placements into a reoperative abdomen during the study period. These children had a median age of 8 years (IQR 2-15 years), and a mean number of two prior abdominal operations (range 1-10). Laparoscopic guidance was used in 24% of cases. Shunt-related complications within 30 days were lower in the LAP group (0% vs 19%, p=0.001), as were VPS-related post-operative emergency department visits (0% vs 18%, p=0.003) and readmissions (0% vs 13%, p=0.013).&nbsp; Shunt malfunction rates were similar between the two groups (42% OPEN vs 25% LAP, p=0.06), but shunt malfunction occurred sooner in the OPEN group (median 26 vs 78 weeks, p=0.01).&nbsp; Operative times were shorter in the LAP group (63 vs 100 min, p&lt;0.001), with the only bowel injury occurring in the LAP group.&nbsp; Time to feeds, length of stay, and mortality were similar between the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Laparoscopic guidance during VPS placement into the reoperative abdomen is associated with a decrease in shunt-related complications, longer shunt patency, and shorter operative times. Future prospective study may help clarify the potential benefits of laparoscopy in this setting.

A substantial proportion of failure to rescue (FTR), or death after a postoperative complication, in pediatric surgery occurs among infants and neonates. The purpose of our study is to characterize FTR events in infants by age, diagnoses, and procedures.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Our group performed a national cohort study of patients &lt;1 year old within the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program &ndash; Pediatric database who underwent inpatient surgery. Patients were stratified into 3 age cohorts: preterm neonates, term neonates, and infants. Surgical&nbsp;diagnoses and procedures were identified with&nbsp;ICD-9, ICD-10, and CPT&nbsp;codes. Surgical procedures were further classified into elective,&nbsp;urgent, and emergent procedures. The association between age cohort, complications, and FTR was evaluated with multivariable logistic regression according to procedural classification.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among 42,452 patients, 14% had at least 1 complication with an associated FTR rate of 10%. Among patients with FTR, 65% (n=395) were preterm neonates, 25% (n=152) were term neonates, and 10% (n=62) were infants. Six diagnoses (necrotizing enterocolitis&ndash;28%; congenital diaphragmatic hernia&ndash;8%; meconium peritonitis&ndash;5%, volvulus-5%,&nbsp;tracheoesophageal fistula&ndash;2%, premature intestinal perforation-2%) and five procedures (enterectomy&ndash;17%; exploratory laparotomy&ndash;13%; colectomy-12%; congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair&ndash;8%; correction of malrotation&ndash;4%) respectively account for 50% and 54% of all FTR cases. Complication&nbsp;(13-52%) and FTR (2&ndash;33%) rates varied significantly by surgical diagnosis (Figure).&nbsp;Preterm neonates had increased odds of&nbsp;complications for urgent (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.59 [1.23&ndash;2.04]) and emergent (OR 1.58 [1.24&ndash;2.02]) but not elective (OR 1.03 [0.94&ndash;1.13]) procedures relative to infants. Similarly, preterm neonates had increased odds of FTR for urgent (OR 3.87 [1.62&ndash;9.23]) and emergent (OR 2.94 [1.71&ndash;5.07]) but not elective (OR 1.22 [0.77&ndash;1.94]) procedures.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Preterm neonates account for the majority<sup>&nbsp;</sup>of FTR cases in children &lt;1 year of age. NEC and CDH account for almost 40% of all&nbsp;FTR events. Additionally, elective&nbsp;procedures do not increase the odds of&nbsp;FTR for preterm neonates. Our results can help guide quality improvement initiatives in infant surgery by targeting high yield pathology.&nbsp;

The Nuss procedure is the standard treatment for operative correction of pectus excavatum deformities. Surgeon preference and patient factors guide operative planning, resulting in variations in operative technique. We hypothesize certain techniques are associated with specific postoperative complications.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Following IRB approval, we performed a single center retrospective review of patients undergoing Nuss procedure from 2016 to 2020. Intraoperative techniques analyzed included use of sternal elevator, number of bars, and use of bilateral stabilizing sutures. Patient demographics, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes were collected and reported as median with interquartile ranges or percentages. Statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) was determined with Wilcoxon Rank-Sum and Chi-Squared tests. Multivariate analysis was also performed to control for the introduction of intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) as a novel pain management technique in 2018.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Two hundred sixty-five patients were identified. Number of bars placed were compared as 1 bar versus 2 bars. Patients requiring two bars were older (17 vs 15, p = 0.0001), and had a larger Haller Index (4.6 vs 4.1, p = 0.005) &nbsp;Patient demographics were not significantly different for sternal elevator use or stabilizing suture use. Placement of two bars was associated with a significant increased risk of pleural effusion, post-operative thoracostomy tube, and readmission (Table 1). Additionally, the use of a sternal elevator was associated with increased post-operative complications including pleural effusion, post-operative thoracostomy tube, surgical site infection, and readmission (Table 1). Multivariate analysis supported these results with 2 bars increasing the odds of pleural effusion (Odds Ratio&nbsp;3.68 [1.29 &ndash; 10.49]), post-operative thoracostomy&nbsp;tube (3.81 [1.22 &ndash; 11.86]), and readmission (3.58 [1.38 &ndash; 9.29]). Similarly, sternal elevator use increased odds of pleural effusion (5.63 [1.39 &ndash; 22.9]), post-operative thoracostomy tube (5.45 [1.12 &ndash; 33.63]), and readmission (4.29 [1.09 &ndash; 16.85]). Finally, the use of bilateral stabilizing sutures resulted in less frequent slipped bars (bilateral sutures 0%, unilateral/no sutures 5%) without statistical significance (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Older patients with a larger Haller index were more likely to need placement of two bars. Placement of more than one bar and use of sternal elevator are associated with significantly higher risk of certain postoperative complications.

Furthermore, mechanism of injury (MOI) focused studies have identified that most pediatric traumas are preventable, with lack of proper restraints in motor vehicle crashes (MVC) making up the majority.&nbsp;The goal of our study was to identify the MOI in pediatric trauma-related fatalities&nbsp;and identify if these injuries were preventable.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A&nbsp;retrospective, single institution review at an American College of Surgeons-Verified Level 1 pediatric trauma center, of pediatric (age&lt;18) trauma fatalities from 2010-2019.&nbsp; Patients were excluded if primary description of incident was missing.&nbsp;MOI, use of protective devices, demographic, and whether injury was preventable were collected. Preventable injury was defined as any injury,&nbsp;that if proper preventative measures had been taken, could have been avoided. This included any child with a self-inflicted gunshot wound (GSW), non-accidental trauma (NAT), children operating adult all-terrain vehicles, unwitnessed auto pedestrian accidents&nbsp;in children less than 10 years old, or motor cycle crashes&nbsp;or MVC without proper protective gear. For analysis, patients were divided into 5 age cohorts and&nbsp;frequencies and proportions were used to summarize data.&nbsp; Bivariate testing was done using Fisher&rsquo;s exact and Monte Carlo estimate for the exact test.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: MOI was found to be age cohort specific with NAT making up a large percentage of deaths in children less than 1 (87.5%) and 1-4 (35.6%). MVC was the most common MOI in children 5 years and older, with 59.1% in the 5-9, 37.5% in the 10-14, and 45.2% in the 15-18 age group. Preventable injury was found to be statically significant (p&lt;.0001) with a negative association as age increased, with 91.7% in those less than 1, 53.3% in 1-4, 40.9% in 5-9, 31.3% in 10-14 and 26% in 15-18 being deemed preventable. Of injuries deemed preventable, MOI in children less than 5 was most commonly NAT and in children 10 years and older suicide by GSW was the largest proportion.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study has identified a change in the trend of preventable MOI&nbsp;in pediatric trauma fatalities.&nbsp;Although, MVC continues to comprise the majority of trauma-related fatalities, it was not found to make up the majority of preventable injuries in children in Oklahoma. This highlights a need for educational programs for early identification of child abuse and parental education programs for crying cycle of infants,&nbsp;prevention of&nbsp;minor&rsquo;s access to firearms, as well as improved screening for mental health disorders.

Postoperative intraabdominal abscesses (IAA) are a relatively commonly encountered complication following appendectomy. Empiric institution-specific treatment regimens may fail to prevent IAA due to changes in community or nosocomial bacterial resistance. We aimed to describe the contemporary microbiology of pediatric patients requiring drainage of an IAA after an appendectomy for appendicitis.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Medical records at a single institution between the years of 2015 &ndash; 2018 were reviewed for patients &lt;18 years of age who required percutaneous drainage of an IAA following an appendectomy for appendicitis. Patients without culture data available for resistance analysis were excluded from the study.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 774 patients undergoing appendectomy, a total of 71 patients (9.2%) required drainage of an IAA with 68 (95.7%) of these representing patients with complicated appendicitis.&nbsp; Of the 71 patients requiring drainage of IAA, 48 (67%) were male and the median age was 9.8 (IQR 7.7 &ndash; 11.9) years. The most common postoperative empiric antimicrobial regimen prior to abscess development was ceftriaxone and metronidazole which was used in 64 (90.1%) patients. Abscess fluid cultures identified organisms in 34 (47.9%) patients with the remaining 37 (52.1%) of cultures not growing an organism. Of the patient&rsquo;s cultures that identified organisms, 19 cases (55.8%) were polymicrobal with 17 (50%) cases documenting an organism with an antimicrobial resistance. Most notably, Escherichia coli was resistant to the empiric regimen in 20% of cultures where it was identified. Empiric antimicrobial regimens did not appropriately cover Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 92.3% of cultures where it was identified or the Enterococcus species in 100% of cultures where it was identified(Table). Antimicrobial regimens were changed following IAA drainage in 30 (42.2%) instances with 23 (32.4%) instances due to resistance in culture results or lack of appropriate empiric antimicrobial coverage. The most common antimicrobial regimen patients were changed to due to culture results was piperacillin/tazobactam which occurred in 15(21.1%) cases.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Culture data from IAA drainage following appendectomy for appendicitis frequently demonstrates resistance to or lack of appropriate coverage by empiric antimicrobial regimens. These data support close review of IAA culture results to identify prevalent and resistant pathogens along with local changes in resistance.&nbsp;

Beres<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - Davis,Division Of Pediatric General, Thoracic And Fetal Surgery,Sacramento, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Traumatic abdominal wall hernia (TAWH) in children is an uncommon injury and is most often seen following blunt abdominal trauma by bicycle handlebars. There is no consensus in the surgical community on the management of these rare cases. We performed a systematic review of the literature to describe demographics, mechanism, management, and outcomes.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar was performed by two authors to identify English-language publications of traumatic abdominal wall hernia in patients &lt; 18 years old. Conflicts were resolved by consensus. Data were collected on demographics, imaging, associated injuries, operative management, and outcomes including post-operative complications and recurrence.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 67 articles were reviewed with 97 cases of TAWH. 82.5% of patients were male and the median age was 9 (range 2-15). Injury by bicycle handlebar was most common (74.2%) followed by motor vehicle collision (MVC, 14.4%). The most common imaging modalities were computed tomography (62.8%) and ultrasound (26.8%). Forty-one patients had intraabdominal injuries (42.3%), most commonly bowel or mesenteric injuries (n=33, 80.5% of all injuries and 34.0% of all patients). Rate of intraabdominal injury was significantly higher in patients with injuries due to other mechanisms when compared to bicycle handlebar injuries (61.1% vs. 30.8%, p=0.03). Most patients were managed operatively (n = 82, 84.5%), with the majority undergoing surgical repair during the index hospitalization (n=73/82, 89.0% of patients managed operatively) and nine undergoing delayed repair. Twelve patients were managed non-operatively with resolution of the hernia on repeat exam and/or imaging. Most hernias were repaired with primary closure via open approach (90.4%, 66/73). There were two reported complications: a bowel obstruction which resolved non-operatively, and a surgical site infection which was treated with incision and drainage. There were no reported recurrences over a median of follow up of 4 months in patients who underwent repair.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pediatric TAWH is a rare diagnosis and has a high association with intraabdominal injuries, particularly due to a more significant mechanism such as MVC. Operative evaluation for intraabdominal injury should be strongly considered as one-third of patients had concurrent bowel injury. Although open repair is more commonly performed, laparoscopic repair has been described with success. Recurrence rates appear low but follow up has been short-term.

It often presents as advanced stage disease, and complete surgical resection remains the only curative therapy. The prognostic and therapeutic roles of lymphadenectomy in pediatric patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are not well defined. The aim of this study was to describe current practice patterns as well as investigate the impact of lymphadenectomy on survival outcomes in young patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a retrospective cohort study which was performed using the National Cancer Data Base for patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2015.&nbsp; Patients &le;21 years of age diagnosed with non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent liver resection or transplant were evaluated. The clinical characteristics of patients who received a lymphadenectomy were compared with those who received resection or transplant alone using chi-squared tests. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression models.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Seventy five patients were identified for evaluation, of which 35 (47%) underwent lymphadenectomy. Of all patients who received a lymphadenectomy 13 (37%) had positive nodes. In tumors less than 5cm no positive nodes were identified. The trend was toward increased frequency of lymphadenectomy and increased node positivity rates in patients with larger tumors. There were no significant differences in the patient or tumor characteristics in the lymphadenectomy group as compared with the no lymphadenectomy group. Hospital length of stay and readmission rates were similar in the two groups. There was no identified survival benefit in patients who received a lymphadenectomy.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In young patients with non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing liver resection or transplant, lymphadenectomy was not shown to have a survival benefit. It is possible that the lack of effective systemic therapies at this time limits the clinical significance of accurate nodal staging. Future prospective studies will be crucial to fully elucidate this relationship and guide surgical management.

However, complications after hospital discharge related to GT use are common, making optimization of outpatient care and management of family expectations paramount. The purpose of the study is to identify clinical factors associated with continued GT use one-year following GT placement.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database and our tertiary care children&rsquo;s hospital&rsquo;s electronic medical record from 2014-2019. Children less than 1 year old with CHD who underwent cardiac surgery and GT placement between January 2014 - October 2019 were identified. Patient demographics, pre-operative feeding regimen, CHD clinical variables, and GT-related utilization in the year following discharge were evaluated. Bivariate analyses using chi-square for categorical variables and student&rsquo;s t-test for continuous variables were performed on the GT use at one year vs non-use cohorts to identify factors associated with continued GT use one year after being discharged.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Overall, 137 infants with CHD received a GT, with 115 (84%) demonstrating continued GT use at 1 year after surgery. Factors associated with continued GT use at one-year after discharge included lower total percent of goal oral feed tolerance prior to GT surgery (5.3&plusmn;10.0% vs. 17.1&plusmn;24.8%, p-value=0.010), prolonged hospitalization after GT placement (&ge;2 weeks) (35.7% vs. 13.6%, p-value=0.048), and failure to tolerate oral feeds in addition to GT feeds at time of discharge (72.7% vs. 31.3%, p-value&lt;0.001). There was no difference in patient demographic or clinical factors such as gestational age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance status, CHD defect, non-cardiac abnormalities, or chromosomal abnormalities between groups. Clinic or emergency room visits related to a GT complication were common and did not differ between groups.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients with CHD who underwent GT placement and exhibited minimal oral nutrition prior to GT placement, prolonged hospitalization after GT placement, and those not tolerating oral feeds at time of discharge are more likely to use their GT one-year after discharge. Quality improvement efforts to optimize care for this high-risk, device-dependent infant population are warranted to maximize growth and development, minimize risks, and facilitate family engagement for long-term outpatient care. &nbsp;

Naik-Mathuria<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Houston, TX, USA <sup>2</sup>Texas Children's Hospital,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Hollow viscus injuries (HVI) in children are infrequent, have subtle clinical and imaging findings at presentation, and can lead to significant morbidity. In adults, the Bowel Injury Prediction Score (BIPS) which includes abdominal pain, WBC &gt; 17K, and a novel CT scoring system, has been shown to identify HVI at initial presentation. Additionally, delay in surgery more than 6 hours is associated with increased mortality from abdominal sepsis. Our purpose was twofold: to determine the validity of the BIPS for early identification of pediatric HVI, and to evaluate whether delayed surgery also leads to worse outcomes in children.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Retrospective chart review (2014-2019) of children treated at a level I pediatric trauma center with HVI confirmed at surgery following blunt or penetrating trauma. Demographics, presenting findings, injuries, time to surgery, and outcomes were analyzed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 42 patients, median age was 8.4 years, 67% were male, and 88% of the injuries were blunt. The most common injury mechanisms were motor vehicle collisions (38%) and child abuse (21%). Almost all (90.5%) patients had CT at presentation and 29% had another CT to confirm HVI. For calculation of the BIPS at presentation, all patients (100%) had abdominal pain (1 point), 34% had WBC &gt;17K (1 point), and the median CT score was 5 (1 point if &ge;4).BIPS &ge;&nbsp;2, which is predictive of HVI in adults, was present in 92% (33/36) of all patients.

Surgery was performed within 12 hours of injury (0.75-11.7 hours) in 42% (18/42), and after 12 hours (13-175 hours) in 57% (24/42). The early and delayed surgery groups had similar presentation and injury types (Table 1). There were no differences in need for ostomy (early 17% vs delayed 4%, p=0.2), infectious complications (early 17% vs delayed 12.5%, p=1.0), readmission related to surgery (early 5.5% vs delayed 8%, p=0.7), and death (early 5.6% vs delayed 0%, p=0.24) between the groups. The early group did have a significantly shorter hospital stay (early 7 vs delayed 12 days, p=0.01). BIPS &ge;&nbsp;2 was similar in the early and delayed surgery groups (early 72% vs delayed 83%, p=0.5), as well as the CT score (median early score 5 vs delayed score 4, p=0.6).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In pediatric patients, the BIPS may be beneficial in providing guidance on early diagnosis of HVI to avoid delay in treatment, although further study is needed. Delay in surgery more than 12 hours from injury does not appear to worsen clinical outcomes except for prolonged recovery. Thus, when the diagnosis of HVI is unclear, initial observation rather than early operation is likely appropriate in pediatric patients in order to avoid unnecessary surgery.

Newborns with omphaloceles often have multiple associated congenital anomalies and lifelong multi-system morbidity. This study sought to identify factors contributing to mortality and hospital readmission in newborns with omphalocele.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The Nationwide Readmissions Database from 2010-2014 was used to identify newborns with omphalocele. Demographics, hospital characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. Chi-squared analysis was used for comparison between cohorts and significance was set at p&lt;0.05.&nbsp; Results were weighted for national estimates.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

3,285 neonates were identified with omphalocele, with 611 (19%) excluded due to death within 48 hours of birth. The cohort was 53% male with 53% delivered via Caesarian section. Associated anomalies were present in 73%, most commonly cardiac (52%), genitourinary (23%) and chromosomal anomalies (13%). Omphalocele repair was performed in 59%, with 16% undergoing multiple repairs/staged closure and 10% with prosthetic graft reconstruction. Neonatal mortality was 11% and was higher in those with cardiac anomalies, chromosomal anomalies, and those with multiple/graft repair, Table 1.

&nbsp;

Readmission within a year occurred in 21%, with 35% of these readmissions occurring at a different hospital than the birth hospital. Most readmissions were unplanned (75%) and associated with infections (66%), pulmonary issues (17%) or gastroesophageal reflux/failure to thrive (8%). Twenty-one percent of elective readmissions were for omphalocele repair. Those with associated anomalies, post-operative infection and low-income status were more likely to experience unplanned readmission, Table 1. Readmission to a different hospital was more common in those with low-income (43%) vs. higher income status (19%), p&lt;0.001.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This is the first nationwide study to evaluate outcomes and readmissions in newborns with omphalocele. We have revealed a neonatal mortality of 30% and high rate of complications, including a previously hidden burden of readmission to a different hospital. Recognition of these risk factors is important to limit fragmentation of care and complications in these complex neonates.

The Heller myotomy is the most definitive treatment for achalasia. This study examines preoperative and operative risk factors on 30-day outcomes in children undergoing Heller myotomy for achalasia. &nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This is a retrospective cohort study of children &lt;18 years undergoing a Heller myotomy for achalasia. Data was collected using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database from 2012-2018. Patients undergoing concurrent unrelated operations were excluded. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, and 30-day outcomes were evaluated for central tendencies and frequency. Operative details of interest included adult versus pediatric surgical specialty, surgical approach, and the use of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and/or esophageal manometry. Outcomes included operative time, length of stay, reoperation, and other post-operative complications and were assessed using Fisher&rsquo;s exact test and Kruskal-Wallis test where appropriate.

The majority of surgeries were performed by pediatric surgeons (88.2%). EGD was used in 35 (19.7%) cases and esophageal manometry was used in 7 (3.9%) cases, 5 of which were performed by non-pediatric surgeons. 30-day complications occurred in 7 (3.9%) patients. Only 4 patients (2.3%) underwent a reoperation and no patients were readmitted. The median operative time was 174.5 minutes (IQR 130-233) and the median length of stay was 2 days (IQR 1-3). There were no significant differences in operative time, length of stay, or post-operative complications between the adult and pediatric surgeons or the addition of EGD or manometry.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Heller myotomy continues to be a very safe operation for achalasia with minimal short-term morbidity in children. There were no observed differences between pediatric and adult surgeons performing this operation, but practice variations may exist regarding the use of manometry.

Markel<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Indiana University School Of Medicine,Pediatric Surgery,Indianapolis, IN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Since the first modern publication of surgical management of pediatric liver tumors by&nbsp;Exelby&nbsp;in 1975, the roles&nbsp;of surgery and chemotherapy have&nbsp;changed drastically. Surgical resection and cisplatin-based chemotherapy remain the mainstay of treatment, but minimally-invasive surgical techniques and minimal effective dose chemotherapy regimens have gained popularity of late. We hypothesize that chemotherapy regimens have evolved to minimize the amount given in the immediate post-operative period, and that minimally invasive surgical techniques have risen in relative popularity for the resection of pediatric hepatic malignancies.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We queried the Pediatric Health Information System database for all primary hepatic malignancies&nbsp;and associated operations&nbsp;from&nbsp;2004-2019.&nbsp;We extracted&nbsp;demographics, type of operation,&nbsp;chemotherapy, and&nbsp;readmissions.&nbsp;Logistic regression, Pearson, and Fisher&rsquo;s exact test&nbsp;were performed using the R statistical package&nbsp;with statistical significance set at p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;2608 operations were performed&nbsp;on 2800 patients over the study period. Patients were predominantly male (59.6%) and white (50.2%). Median age at&nbsp;operation was 2.2 years. The incidence of primary hepatic malignancy&nbsp;and operations performed&nbsp;has&nbsp;trended upward&nbsp;&ndash; 93/123 patients underwent an operation in 2004, while 132/198&nbsp;patients&nbsp;did&nbsp;in 2019 (p=0.10)&nbsp;(Figure 1).&nbsp;The&nbsp;most frequently administered&nbsp;chemotherapeutics&nbsp;during the surgical admission were cisplatin, vincristine, and fluorouracil.&nbsp;The percent of patients who receive chemotherapy during their operative admission has&nbsp;trended down&nbsp;since 2004 &ndash; 39.5% to 28%&nbsp;(p=0.054). Since the&nbsp;introduction of ICD-10, which delineates laparoscopic and open liver resection, there has been an increase in the&nbsp;use&nbsp;of laparoscopy&nbsp;&ndash; 5.7%&nbsp;of operations&nbsp;in 2015 to 16% in 2019&nbsp;(p=0.004). Odds of subsequent inpatient readmission were lower in females&nbsp;(OR=0.72,&nbsp;p=&lt;0.001) and those that stayed in the ICU during their&nbsp;initial&nbsp;surgical admission (OR=0.38,&nbsp;p=&lt;0.001). There&nbsp;is&nbsp;a moderately weak correlation between the administration of chemotherapy during the surgical admission and subsequent inpatient readmission (R2=0.229,&nbsp;p=&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;As the number of primary hepatic malignancies in children has increased, surgical management and effective chemotherapy have risen to meet this challenge. The role of laparoscopy has increased in just the last&nbsp;half-decade, and the number of patients receiving chemotherapy during their index admission&nbsp;has decreased. We anticipate a further trend toward laparoscopic resection and minimal effective chemotherapy as the understanding of overall disease-free survival&nbsp;evolves.

Studies in pediatric cardiothoracic and adult trauma patients suggest clinical signs and symptoms are safe and sensitive indicators for pneumothorax recurrence. Studies in general pediatric patients demonstrate similar findings, however, these populations are broad. We hypothesize that routine post-pull chest x-rays (PP-CXR) following TT removal in pediatric trauma for hemothorax (HTX), pneumothorax (PTX), or hemopneuothorax (HTPX) does not guide the decision for TT reinsertion.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients &le; 18 years of age undergoing TT removal after thoracic trauma with HTX, PTX, or HPTX were retrospectively reviewed at a Level 1 pediatric trauma center. Exclusions included TT removed during mechanical ventilation or while additional TT remained. The primary outcome of interest was TT reinsertion rate after PP-CXR. Secondary outcomes of interest were differences observed among patients with worsened or stable and/or improved PP-CXR findings.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Fifty-nine patients were included: 69.5% male (n=41), 72.9% white (n=43), median age of 13.3 (IQR 6.6), 69.5% blunt trauma (n=41), 30.5% penetrating trauma (n=18). Primary TT indications were PTX (62.7%; n=37), HTX (10.2%; n=6), and HPTX (27%; n=16). A PP-CXR was performed in 57 patients (96.6%). Of these, 29.8% had worse findings while 70.2% had stable or improved findings. Those with higher injury severity scores (ISS) were more likely to have worsened PP-CXR findings (p=0.0154); otherwise there were no differences in terms of gender (p=0.2144), age (p=0.2560), race (p=.2405), trauma mechanism (p=0.1114), indication for TT placement (p=0.1283), TT size (p=0.2725), TT type (p=1.0000), total TT days (p=0.4384), or initial PTX and/or HTX characteristics such as initial PTX size and volume drained in first day (table 1). While there were no differences in total CXR during hospitalization among these groups (p=0.2818), those with worsened PP-CXR findings were more likely to have additional films following the PP-CXR (p=0.0389). Overall, six children had clinical signs or symptoms, all varying in PP-CXR findings (p=1.0000), and none with TT reinsertion. One (1.8%) asymptomatic child with worsened PP-CXR findings had TT reinsertion based purely on the PP-CXR findings.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The vast majority of PP-CXR did not guide TT reinsertion after pediatric thoracic trauma. Although one patient had a TT reinsertion, it is unclear if this patient would have remained asymptomatic without TT reinsertion. A large variability in management exists surrounding plain films during time of TT removal, and treatment algorithms may aid in reducing variability and potentially unnecessary routine films.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by complete surgical resection of the tumor is paramount for curative treatment of HB. Central hepatectomy (CH) is an uncommon surgical technique that is an option for resection of centrally located tumors in segments IV, V and VIII, with the advantage of sparing normal hepatic parenchyma that would otherwise be sacrificed in extensive hepatic resections. Few studies have described outcomes in pediatric patients with HB following CH.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An IRB-approved, retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent CH at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Los Angeles between 2005-2016 was performed. All procedures were performed by pediatric surgeons experienced in complex hepatic resections. Data included patient demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, weight), preoperative chemotherapy, operative factors (estimated blood loss, operative time, method of vascular control, method of liver resection), and post-operative outcomes (complications, blood transfusion, pathology, relapse, need for liver transplantation).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Eight patients (4F:4M) underwent CH: 7 patients for HB and 1 patient for focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). Two of the seven patients with HB had metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The median age was 1.9 years. Six of the seven patients with HB underwent preoperative chemotherapy with a median of 4 rounds (3-7 rounds). The median operative time was 186 minutes (143-454 minutes) with median estimated blood loss of 175 mL (100 mL-1200 mL). In the post-operative period, one patient required reintubation in the post-operative care unit for respiratory distress, while another patient had a post-operative bile fluid collection which required radiology-guided aspiration. There were no other perioperative complications. The median length of stay was 5.5 days (5 days-13 days). Of the eight patients, seven had negative gross and microscopic margins on pathology. One patient with a positive margin on pathology successfully completed therapy, without recurrent disease. All patients survived to post-operative follow-up, with a median follow-up duration of 398.5 days (18 days-4400 days). Two patients developed recurrent disease requiring reoperations (formal hepatic lobectomy and orthotopic liver transplantation). These two patients had negative margins on pathology, with tumor within 1 mm of the resection margins.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;CH is a safe and effective alternative to extended right- or left- hepatectomies in patients with centrally located liver tumors and is associated with good clinical and pathologic outcomes.

Iatrogenic blood losses in preterm neonates commonly lead to anemia in the days following birth. Indications for blood transfusions in this population are controversial. Evidence-based guidelines for blood transfusions have been published but not well adapted. We hypothesized that increased transfusions, often outside of published guidelines, is associated with adverse outcomes such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis, and increased in-hospital mortality.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

In a single center review of a 72-bed quaternary referral NICU, we retrospectively evaluated the incidence of adverse outcomes such as NEC, sepsis, and in-hospital mortality among preterm neonates receiving blood products compared to those not receiving blood products. Baseline data collected include birth weight, gestational age, delivery details, and volume and type of blood product transfused. Outcome measures include, but are not limited to, development of NEC, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity, and in-hospital mortality. Categorical variables were analyzed by the Chi Square Test of Independence. Data were also analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There were 137 preterm neonates in the transfusion group and 96 preterm neonates in the control group. Among the 137 patients receiving blood products, 127 (93%) received at least one red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Among these patients, compliance with evidence-based RBC transfusion guidelines was 32%. Compared to controls, preterm neonates receiving blood products had a lower mean gestational age (28.4 vs. 33.4 weeks, p &lt; 0.01) and a higher incidence of NEC, sepsis, and in-hospital mortality [X<sup>2</sup>(1, N = 233) = 16.9, p &lt; 0.01; X<sup>2</sup>(1, N = 233) = 49.8, p &lt; 0.01; X<sup>2</sup>(1, N = 233) = 15.2, p &lt; 0.01, respectively]. Receiving a blood product and gestational age were each significant independent predictors of NEC, sepsis, and BPD (AUC 0.83, 0.81, 0.88, respectively). Receiving a blood product was also a significant independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (AUC 0.78).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Hospital acquired anemia is common among preterm neonates, yet there is no national consensus on blood transfusion guidelines in this population. Data regarding clinical outcomes following blood transfusion are conflicting. In this single center review, poor compliance with evidence-based guidelines for RBC transfusions was associated with an increased incidence of NEC, sepsis, and a higher in-hospital mortality. Younger gestational age was associated with an increased rate of transfusion, and multivariate analysis shows&nbsp;receiving a blood product and gestational age are each independent predictors of adverse outcomes. The associations shown in this study suggest that blood transfusions may be harmful when used liberally. A prospective study is needed to determine if implementation of evidence-based guidelines in preterm neonates reduces the incidence of adverse outcomes in this population.

Engaging patients/parents in healthcare has shown to improve outcomes and safety. Prior studies at our institution found an association between increased parent engagement and surgical safety checklist (SSC) adherence. In 2019, developed through a stakeholder-driven process, we implemented a parent-centered script (PCS) for the pre-induction portion of the checklist. We hypothesized that the PCS would improve SSC adherence and post-operative outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;

A retrospective cohort study was conducted of pediatric (age&lt;18) patients undergoing elective surgery at a tertiary children&rsquo;s hospital from June-July 2018 (pre-PCS) and June-July 2019 (post-PCS). Direct observation of adherence to the pre-induction SSC was conducted by trained research personnel. Patient demographics and outcomes within 30 days of operation were abstracted from the medical record. Patients were excluded from analysis if their parents were not present during SSC completion, and if they had a second operation during the study period, the second operation was excluded. Adherence to the pre-induction SSC was scored from 1-6 based on the 6 items that encouraged parent participation in the PCS. Adherence and outcomes were compared between the pre and post-PCS groups. Univariate analysis was performed. P value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;

Of the 270 patients, 154 (57%) underwent surgery prior to implementation of the PCS and 116 (43%) after implementation. Groups were similar by age and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification, and most operations were performed as an outpatient. However, a greater percentage of patients in the post-PCS group (51%) had previously undergone surgery compared to the pre-PCS group (38%) (p=0.04). Pre-PCS adherence had median score of 6 (IQR 5-6), compared to a median score of 4 (IQR 4-5) in the post-PCS group (p&lt;0.001). There were 36 (13%) total patients with a complication, with 20 (13%) in the pre-PCS group and 16 (14%) in the post-PCS group (p=0.86). Patient complications included: reoperation (13%), return emergency room visit (7%), readmission (4%), wound dehiscence (2%), wound infection (2%), and systemic infection (0.4%). However, there was no difference in outcomes when compared between pre and post-PCS groups (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;

Implementation of a PCS in the pre-induction SSC did not improve SSC adherence as evidenced by the decrease in adherence score. However, this decrease in adherence was not associated with worse patient outcomes. Further research and collaboration amongst the health care team is needed in order to obtain a simple, effective SSC that also promotes parent engagement and optimal post-operative patient outcomes.

Despite the frequent use of GJ tubes in pediatric patients, the patient and healthcare impacts are not well characterized. We aimed to understand the complications associated with GJ tubes in pediatric patients. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted of all pediatric patients (age &lt;18) who underwent a GJ tube placement and/or associated intervention at a tertiary children&rsquo;s hospital from January 2010 to January 2020. Patient demographics, GJ interventions, and complications were abstracted from medical records. A tube-related complication was defined as any additional encounter with the medical system related to the GJ tube, including emergency room visits, readmissions, and/or tube replacement. Descriptive analyses and measures of correlation were performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 407 complications among 87 patients were identified during the study period, of which 311 (76.4%) complications required tube replacement. Of the 87 patients included, 82 (94.3%) had at least one complication. The median number of complications per patient was 3 (range: 0-23). Of the 87 patients, 60.9% were males, 33.3% white and 67.9% with government-funded insurance. Ten (11.5%) patients died during the study period due to other causes. The median time to first complication was 12.2 months (IQR: 4.7-28.6). Change in patients&rsquo; weight had a positive correlation (Figure) to shorter time interval between subsequent complications (Spearman coefficient rs=0.32,&nbsp;p&nbsp;&lt;.0001). Tube-related complications were attributed to dislodgement (41.7%), dysfunction (38.2%), failure to tolerate GJ enteral nutrition (10.2%), and stoma site related problems (2.7%). A majority of the complications required general anesthesia (90.1%) for tube replacement, but no anesthesia-related adverse events occurred. Of the patients who needed intervention, 90.8% required at least one tube replacement, 68.9% patients had their tube replaced for a different length, and 10.3% eventually required Nissen fundoplication.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Almost every patient with a GJ tube had a complication due to tube dislodgment and/or dysfunction, often requiring readmission and general anesthesia. Change in patient&rsquo;s weight was associated with the time interval between subsequent complications, requiring surveillance for changing or upsizing tubes. Further research is needed to determine patient and tube-related risk factors predictive of GJ tube complications. Optimal management of pediatric patients requiring GJ tubes remains elusive.

Firearm injuries are a major cause of morbidity.&nbsp;How readmission after firearm injury contributes to the burden of disease among patients who survive suicide attempt (SA) or another type of firearm injury (AFI) (accidental shooting, homicide attempt, legal shooting) has not been characterized.&nbsp;We hypothesized that survivors of SA would have higher readmission rates than survivors of AFI.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Readmission Database (NRD) was examined from 2010-2014.&nbsp;Patients that survived their index hospitalization with firearm injury were analyzed and survivors of SA and AFI were compared.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 130,683 patients with firearm injury discharged after index hospitalization, 2,399 (1.8%) were readmitted. There were 1,268 readmissions at 30-days and 1,322 at 90-days. Readmitted patients were older and had higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CMI). Readmission rate was lower in the SA group (99.2 vs. 846.7 per 1000 shot, p&lt;0.001). &nbsp;On multivariate analysis, variables associated with readmission included higher CMI (OR=6.12, 95%CI: 3.42-16.2, p=0.001), higher ISS (OR: 3.10, 95%CI: 1.40-6.87, p=0.01), discharge to short-term hospital (OR: 2.30, 95%CI: 1.39-3.79, p=0.001), and leaving AMA (OR: 2.26, 95%CI: 1.41-3.62, p=0.001).&nbsp;SA was not associated with readmission (OR: 1.02, 95%CI: 0.46-2.24, p=0.97.

Given challenges in official national data tracking, and despite being among the most closely monitored group of citizens, the pattern of homicidal violence currently remains unknown for incarcerated individuals.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective analysis of the 36 states included in the 2003-2017 National Violent Death Reporting System Restricted Access Database was performed to include incidents where homicide occurred within the prison system. This excludes law-enforcement related homicides. For the autopsy and law enforcement summary narratives, a preliminary 10% random sample was coded using grounded theory to discover themes amenable to interventions. Trends of patient demographics, illicit substance use, homicide causes and circumstances, and attempts at resuscitation were identified.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 473 cases of violent deaths while incarcerated were recorded over 14 years. Mean age was 39.6&plusmn;14.0 years, 99% were men, and 37.2% were Black, compared to 55.4% White and 11.6% Hispanic or Latinx (p &lt; 0.001). Of inmates who were murdered, 8.9% had a current mental health diagnosis, and 1.7% had a history of alcohol use disorder. Gang violence-related homicide occurred in 7.2%, with no significant difference between races (p=0.24). An argument preceded the homicide in 29.8% of cases whereas the victim was a bystander 18.8% of the time.

We compared risk adjusted rates of in-hospital and long-term mortality among Pennsylvania trauma centers. We hypothesized that centers with low rates of in-hospital mortality would also have low rates of long-term mortality.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified injured patients age &ge; 65 admitted to Pennsylvania trauma centers, 2013-2014 using the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study, a robust, state-wide trauma registry. We used probabilistic matching with supervised machine learning to link trauma registry records to Medicare claims. Matching variables were injury date, patient demographics, and injury characteristics. Outcomes were inpatient, 30-day, and 1-year mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to calculate expected mortality rates for each trauma center at each time point. Center performance was assessed using observed-to-expected ratios. Models included presenting physiology, comorbidities, injury characteristics, and demographics. Center-level ranks for in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality were compared using Spearman&rsquo;s rho.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We included 15,451 patients at 28 centers. Median, unadjusted in-hospital mortality was 6.4% (interquartile range [IQR] 4.5-7.6%). There were 3 high outliers and 2 low outliers for in-hospital mortality. Median 30-day mortality was 11.1% (IQR 10.3-12.4%). Just 46.3% of those who died within 30 days died in the hospital. There were 0 low and 1 high outlier, also an outlier for in-hospital mortality. The correlation between in-hospital and 30-day mortality ranks was 0.7.

The correlation between in-hospital and 1-year mortality ranks was 0.4.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Nearly half of injured older adults who die within 30 days of injury do so after hospital discharge. Hospital rankings for in-hospital mortality correlate poorly with long term outcomes, underscoring the importance of looking past survival to discharge for quality improvement and benchmarking.

The role of FC in massively transfused (MT) trauma patients is still speculative. Our study aims to assess the role of FC as an adjunct to MT in trauma patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a 2015-2017 analysis of the ACS-TQIP database and included all adult (age &ge; 18 years) trauma patients who received a MT (&gt;10pRBCs/24-hour) excluding those with cryoprecipitate transfusion. Patients were stratified into two groups based on receipt of FC within the first 24-hours (FC vs. No-FC). Outcome measures were blood products transfused, in-hospital complications, and mortality. Multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses were performed along with a Kaplan-Meyer survival curve.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We analyzed a total of 593,818 trauma patients, of whom 4,510 (FC: 229; No-FC: 4,281) were included in our analysis. Mean age was 40&plusmn;20 years, median ISS was 29 [20-41], and GCS was 10 [3-15]. Overall volume of pRBCs transfused in the first 24-hours was 14 [11-19] units, plasma was 9 [6-13] units, and platelets were 2 [1-3] units. The overall complication rate was 44%, mortality was 43%, and 31% of the patients died in the first 24 hours. Patients in the FC group received a lower volume of plasma (p&lt;0.01) and pRBCs (p&lt;0.01). Additionally, patients who received FC had lower rates of 24-hrs mortality (p&lt;0.01) and in-hospital mortality (p&lt;0.01). However, there was no difference between the two groups regarding complications (p=0.67), or volume of platelets transfused (p=0.11). Table 1 On logistic regression, the use of FC was associated with decreased 24-hrs mortality (OR: 0.78 [0.67-0.93], p=0.01) and decreased in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.89 [0.70-0.96], p=0.01), but was not associated with in-hospital complications (OR: 1.57 [0.81-1.94], p=0.62). On linear regression, the use of FC was not associated with 24-hr pRBCs (&beta;= -0.07[-0.12 to 0.88], p=0.16), 24-hr plasma (&beta;= 0.46[-3.88 to 4.81], p=0.83), and 24-hr platelets transfusions (&beta;= 1.27[-1.49 to 4.04], p=0.36). Overall survival improved in the FC group.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The use of FC as an adjunct to MT may reduce mortality without affecting in-hospital complications and transfusion requirements. Further studies are needed to understand its potentially beneficial effects in massively transfused patients.

Gaughan<sup>4</sup>, A. Goldenberg-Sandau<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Cooper Medical School of Rowan University,Camden, NJ, USA <sup>2</sup>Cooper University Hospital,Department Of Surgery,Camden, NJ, USA <sup>3</sup>Cooper University Hospital,Department Of Pathology,Camden, NJ, USA <sup>4</sup>Cooper University Hospital,Cooper Research Institute,Camden, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Whole blood has gained popularity as a means of trauma resuscitation within the past 5 years. Historically the military has utilized whole blood since World War I and most recently during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. However, its overall use has diminished due to technological advances in blood component fractionation as well as fears of hemolysis and infectious disease transmission. Although there are studies and review articles on the efficacy of whole blood, the analysis of cost pertaining to whole blood&rsquo;s expense is limited.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective 1:1 case control study of 280 subjects comparing trauma patients receiving resuscitation with blood component therapy to those receiving whole blood plus component therapy between January 2014 and July 2019. Patient matching was completed based on age, sex, injury severity score (ISS), and mechanism of injury (MOI) (blunt vs. penetrating). Endpoints included the number of units of whole blood (WB), packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, and cryoprecipitate each patient received. Data analysis utilized ratios of price for each unit where PRBCs=1, WB=1.24, FFP=0.2, platelets=2.27, and cryoprecipitate=1.21. Due to proprietary nature of the cost of individual blood components, absolute price numbers are not included here. &nbsp;Comparisons were made with Wilcoxon two sample ranked sum tests with a p-value of &lt;0.05 deemed to be statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There is a statistically significant decrease in the number of units PRBCs used in WB patients compared to component therapy. There is also a statistically significant decrease in the cost of PRBCs when price is controlled. &nbsp;FFP, platelet, and cryoprecipitate use showed an absolute decrease in units used (Table 1), but did not yield statistical significance. Total cost is decreased from 16.79 cost units to 11.70 in whole blood recipients as well (p=0.1660).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Red blood cell use and cost is decreased when adding whole blood to component therapy for trauma resuscitation. Utilizing whole blood decreases absolute total cost as well as absolute cost of FFP, platelets, and cryoprecipitate. A larger, prospective study is needed to increase the subject size and determine additional statistical significance.

There is increasing interest in noninvasive testing, including pupillometry, ultrasonographic transcranial Dopplers (TCD), and optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), to aid in diagnosing TBI in far forward limited resource environments where advanced imaging is not available. Although these techniques have been used to estimate intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with severe brain injury, whether these technologies can effectively assess for TBI or approximate ICP remains to be elucidated. We hypothesized that noninvasive testing including ONSD, pupillometry, and TCD could both accurately distinguish severe TBI and correlate to ICP.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A prospective observational study of 135 patients was conducted at a level 1 trauma center over 36 months. Four groups were enrolled based on clinical examination and head CT findings: nontrauma patients who required ICP monitoring (n=39), trauma patients without TBI (n=30), trauma patients with mild TBI (n=30), and trauma patients with severe TBI requiring ICP monitoring (n=36). All patients underwent bilateral daily measurements of ONSD using L12-3 linear array transducer, pupillometry using NeurOptics pupillometer, and TCD with both CX50 SONOSITE and Spencer ST3 Yi Pencil probe for three consecutive days post-injury.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;ONSD differed significantly between patient groups.&nbsp; The mean &plusmn; standard deviation of ONSD was 0.57&plusmn;0.9 cm for severe TBI patients, compared to 0.49&plusmn;0.1 cm and 0.47&plusmn;0.08 cm for mild and no-TBI on post-injury day 2 (p&lt;0.01) but did not correlate with ICP. Pupillometric constriction velocity, dilation velocity and percent change in pupil diameter were significantly different in the severe TBI patients on postinjury days 1 and 2, but did not correlate with ICP (Table). TCD measurements were similar between severe TBI patients and those with mild or no-TBI, but middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic velocity, MCA flow velocity, and carotid flow velocity, did correlate with ICP on Pearson analysis (Table).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Non-invasive screening methods including ONSD and pupillometry reliably discern patients with severe TBI as early as the first day post-injury. In contrast, TCD may correlate with ICP. These technologies have not been validated as a replacement for radiologic or invasive methods of diagnosing and managing TBI. However, these methods show promise for use in far forward, low-resource environments, as a supplementary screening tool for severe TBI, and pragmatic validation is warranted.

Currently, publications detailing the outcomes in geriatric patients diagnosed with a TBI following an inter-facility transfer are rare. Therefore, the goal was to analyze differences in clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of geriatric (&ge;65 y.o.) and non-geriatric TBI patients transferred from an Acute Care Facility (ACF) to a level 1 Trauma Center (TC).


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This retrospective study included 1118 TBI patients following a transfer from ACF to TC (2016 - 2019). There were 798 geriatric patients (GP) and 320 non-geriatric patients (NGP). To ensure comparability in the severity of trauma, 317 GP and 317 NGP were matched (without replacement) by Injury Severity Score and Head Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS). Analyzed variables included: demographics, pre-injury anticoagulation, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), rates of blood transfusions, repeat head CT, craniotomies, transfer timing, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and length of stay (ICULOS), hospital LOS (HLOS), discharge disposition, complication, and mortality.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;GP had twice the mean age of NGP (82 vs 45 years), were mostly female (57% vs 30%), had more comorbidities (94% vs 70%) and higher anticoagulation use (54% vs 9%), all p&lt;0.001. Both groups had similar GCS of 14. GP had higher rates of blood transfusions (32% vs 13%) and repeat CT scans (94% vs 86%), both p&lt;0.001. In GP, especially patients &ge;75 years old, 61% did not undergo craniotomy due to terminal bleeding or presence of advanced directives. There was no statistically significant difference between transfer times from ACF to TC (3.9 hours), ICULOS (3 days in both), HLOS (4 vs 5 days), or complications (13% vs 12%), all p&gt;0.1. TC discharge disposition was different between groups, with GP having statistically higher discharge to hospice (8% vs 1%, p&lt;0.001). GP had higher ICU admissions (57% vs 46%, p=0.003) and mortality (10% vs 3%, p=0.001) [Fig 1].


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Geriatric TBI patients constituted twice the amount of non-geriatric patients transferred from an Acute Care Facility to a Trauma Center. GP had higher rates of blood product transfusions, anticoagulant use, ICU admissions, and more than 3 times higher morality than NGP. Based on the prevalence of anticoagulation therapy and higher mortality in GP, we recommend geriatric patients with suspected TBI be considered for direct transportation to TC.

Social vulnerability indices were created to measure regional resiliency&nbsp;to&nbsp;environmental disasters&nbsp;based on several&nbsp;socioeconomic and population&nbsp;characteristics of a discrete geographic region. They contain multiple validated constructs that may also identify geographically vulnerable populations after traumatic injury. Our objective was to determine if these indices correlate with injury fatality rates in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We evaluated two&nbsp;social vulnerability indices:&nbsp;The&nbsp;Hazards &amp; Vulnerability Research Institute&#39;s Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) and the CDC&rsquo;s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). We also analyzed SVI sub-indices&nbsp;the make up the composite score&nbsp;(socioeconomic status, disabled populations, minority populations, and housing &amp; transport status).&nbsp;These indices are composite scores calculated at the county-level and transformed into percentile ranks for all US counties, ranging from 0 to 100 where larger values indicate greater social vulnerability.&nbsp;Outcomes included&nbsp;age-adjusted&nbsp;county-level overall, firearm, and motor vehicle collision (MVC)&nbsp;deaths&nbsp;per 100,000 population.&nbsp;Linear regression determined the association of injury fatality rates each index.&nbsp;Bivariate choropleth mapping identified variation and spatial autocorrelation of all-cause fatality&nbsp;and&nbsp;SoVI.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

3,137 US counties were included.&nbsp;SoVI&nbsp;and SVI were moderately correlated with each other (+0.48). Despite this, both indices were associated with increasing fatality rates for overall (SoVI&nbsp;0.28; 95%CI 0.25-0.30, p&lt;0.01; SVI 0.26; 95%CI 0.23-29, p&lt;0.01), firearm (SoVI&nbsp;0.08; 95%CI 0.07-0.09, p&lt;0.01; SVI 0.09; 95%CI 0.09-0.10, p&lt;0.01), and MVC deaths (SoVI&nbsp;0.11; 95%CI 0.10-0.13, p&lt;0.01; SVI 0.14; 95%CI 0.13-0.15, p&lt;0.01). Among SVI sub-indices, disabled population was the strongest predictor of overall injury fatalities (0.34; 95%CI 0.32-0.37, p&lt;0.01) and MVC fatalities (0.18; 95%CI 0.17-0.19, p&lt;0.01). Socioeconomic sub-index was the strongest predictor of firearm fatalities (0.11; 95%CI 0.10-0.12, p&lt;0.01). There is significant geographic variation in both&nbsp;SoVI&nbsp;and injury fatality rates at the county-level across the US (Fig 1), with moderate spatial autocorrelation of&nbsp;SoVI&nbsp;(Moran&#39;s I 0.35, p&lt;0.01) and high autocorrelation of injury fatality rates (Moran&#39;s I 0.77, p&lt;0.01).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Although&nbsp;SoVI&nbsp;and SVI are not interchangeable, higher social vulnerability is associated with higher injury fatality rates in both indices. These social vulnerability indices may be useful in the epidemiologic and geographic assessment of trauma-related fatality rates. Further study is warranted to determine if these indices outperform traditional measures of socioeconomic status and related constructs used in the trauma&nbsp;research.&nbsp;

Injury pattern, resource availability, and distance to tertiary care contribute to mortality rates of injured patients in rural America. We aimed to examine the effects of prehospital time and distance, on trauma outcomes in the rural setting.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Following IRB approval, we performed a 10-year retrospective review of trauma registry data from the Universities of Missouri and Kentucky. We collected and calculated demographics, transport, injury severity and illness data, as well as hospital and discharge characteristics. Predictions were determined by univariate and multivariate regression, in addition to standard statistical evaluation, to identify differences in outcomes based on transport time.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
32,869 patient records (mean age 47.8&plusmn;20.5 yrs) were reviewed. Median transport distance was 33.6 miles by air, and 42.4 miles by ground. Median transport time was 125 minutes, with 56.1% reaching the trauma center within 2 hours of injury. When controlling for distance, blunt trauma patients had longer transport times than those with penetrating injuries (7.2 min/mile vs 4.9 min/mile, p &lt;0.0001). Shorter transport times were predictive of worse shock indices, injury severity scores, and mortality. Patients transported between 2-3 hours (10.7%) were most likely worsen prior to arrival (p 0.001), based on increasing Revised Trauma Scores from scene to admission. Patients transported in the 2-3-hour window were also most likely to require prehospital blood products (77%), ICU admission (27.8%), and operation (77%), and had the second highest mortality(6.8%) following those arriving within an hour (8.5%). Figure 1.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Most severely injured patients were transported to definitive care within 2 hours. However, patients whose transport was delayed up to 3 hours, had significantly elevated risk to require escalated care. An opportunity exists to improve transport time for these patients.

Pirkle<sup>1</sup>, L. L. Shi<sup>1</sup>, M. J. Lee<sup>1</sup>, J. Strelzow<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Chicago,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are one of the most frequently prescribed classes of medication. Although this therapy was originally viewed as side effect free, particularly in comparison to its predecessors, it has been suggested that SSRIs may have additional systemic effects rather than those simply existing within the confines of the blood brain barrier. More recently, SSRIs have been implicated in altering the quality of bone mineral density and potentially the process of bony fusion. We sought to investigate the effects of preoperative SSRI use on long bone fracture healing.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This study was performed using the PearlDiver national orthopaedic insurance claims database. All patients with a diagnosis of a long bone shaft fracture of the humerus, femur, radius and/or ulna, or tibia and/or fibula were stratified based on their preoperative history of SSRI&rsquo;s. A chronic SSRI cohort was created from all patients with both an active SSRI prescription filled within 3 months prior to, and additional prescriptions within 4-6 months prior to an index fracture diagnosis. An SSRI na&iuml;ve cohort was created including patients without SSRI prescriptions within 6 months prior to the fracture diagnosis. The rate of nonunion within 18 months was assessed for all patients using identification of non-union procedure codes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for chronic preoperative SSRI use as well as other patient comorbidities on the outcome of nonunion repair procedures.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
27,651 shaft fracture patients were identified. Of these, 4,065 were of the humerus, 6,005 of the radius and/or ulna, 4,770 of the femur, and 12,811 of the tibia and/or fibula. 4,634 (16.8%) of all patients had chronic preoperative SSRI prescriptions. In the univariate analyses, chronic preoperative SSRI prescriptions were significantly associated with increased rates of nonunion repair for each fracture subtype (Table 1). In the multivariate regression analyses, we observed a significant association between nonunion repair procedures and chronic preoperative SSRIs in humerus, femur, and radius and/or ulna shaft fracture populations.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our findings suggest that preoperative SSRI prescriptions may be associated with higher rates of nonunion in patients with long bone shaft fractures. This represents an important step in gaining a better understanding of the potential effects this medication class may have on the fracture healing process. Closer follow-up in patients with these prescriptions may be warranted.

Patient satisfaction has become a critical outcome measure, highlighted by the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Although patient satisfaction has not been a traditional focus of Trauma centers, it is a key clinical performance indicator, albeit with unique challenges in the Trauma population. A Patient Satisfaction Action Plan (PSAP) was implemented at our Level 1 Trauma Center (L1TC) to target this measure. The aim of this project is to examine our PSAP&rsquo;s impact on patient satisfaction scores, measured by Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) post-discharge surveys.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective review of our 2015-2018 L1TC HCAHPS data was conducted, prompting our PSAP. The plan, implemented in June 2018, included the following key action items: daily structured patient rounds and multidisciplinary rounds, emphasis on communication with nursing staff, and post-discharge phone calls. A comparison of pre-PSAP data (Jul 2016-Jun 2018) to post-PSAP data (Jul 2018-May 2020) was performed utilizing descriptive statistics and non-parametric testing, with statistical significance set at &alpha;&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 1,221 patient surveys were reviewed (707 pre-PSAP, 514 post-PSAP). When comparing pre-PSAP and post-PSAP data, we noted a significant increase in overall patient satisfaction (Figure 1). Specifically, the overall patient satisfaction increased by nearly 50% (205/707 pre-PSAP, 217/514 post-PSAP, p&lt;0.01). When examining individual HCAHPS domains, we noted a 66% increase in physician communication score and 27% increase in patient-perceived respectfulness of hospital staff (all, p&lt;0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In the 2-year period since its implementation, our institution&rsquo;s Patient Satisfaction Action Plan has proven to have significant success in improving several facets of the patient care experience. We pose that this model has applicability in Trauma Centers with a similar patient/case mix, given motivated staff and clear organization. While our institution identified communication as a main center of focus, we acknowledge that other Trauma Departments may identify alternative areas of improvement that may be more relevant and critical to their particular center&rsquo;s patient experience. Further research is warranted in this area, with specific focus on factors that will highly correlate with greater patient satisfaction.

Treatment for blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) includes antiplatelets (AP) or anticoagulation (AC) and is without standardized guidelines. We hypothesized that treatment of grade I vertebral BCVI with aspirin alone would be associated with similar stroke rate compared to additional AP or AC therapies.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was a sub-analysis of an EAST multicenter, prospective, observational trial including 16 centers. Only grade I vertebral BCVI receiving medical therapy were included. Aspirin monotherapy (ASA) was defined as aspirin alone without alteration during the hospitalization.&nbsp;Non-aspirin therapy (non-ASA) was any other pharmaceutical therapy separate from or in combination with aspirin, or a change from aspirin to another agent. Bivariate and survival analyses were used to evaluate the stroke rate between ASA and non-ASA.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

We analyzed 140 grade I vertebral BCVI (116 ASA, 24 non-ASA). Mean neck abbreviated injury scale score was slightly higher for non-ASA compared with ASA (2.67 vs. 2.12, p=0.01) as was injury severity score (22.00 vs. 16.00, p=0.14). Time to therapy was shorter in non-ASA compared with ASA (15 vs. 27 hours, p=0.03). Treatment complications were similar for non-ASA compared with ASA (4.2% vs. 1.7%, p=0.43). One patient in each group had a BCVI-related stroke, without difference in stroke rate for non-ASA compared with ASA (4.2% vs. 0.9%, p=0.31). The ASA patient with a stroke had aspirin started after the stroke, while the non-ASA patient had medical therapy started prior to the stroke. Tarone-Ware survival analysis did not show a difference in stroke between non-ASA and ASA (p=0.69).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Stroke risk is low in patients with grade I vertebral BCVI, regardless of therapy. Stroke and complications using ASA are equivalent to other AP and AC strategies even though it was started later.

Further analysis of longitudinal data showed significant increases in mortality rates of patients 18-64 (p = 0.026) and less severely injured patients (ISS 16-24; p = 0.042); paralleled by a significant increase in PC for patients age 40 to 64 (p = 0.002) and a trending increase in PC for less severely injured patients (ISS 16-24; p = 0.087). Mortality has not changed based on severity of head, chest, or abdominal injuries. However, PC is more often consulted for patients with no or less severe head injuries (AIS&lt;3) (p = 0.023). Comorbidity rates did not affect PC rates. Cox regression analysis showed that our mortality rate is affected by age (OR = 1.016 [1.008-1.024], p &lt; 0.001), ISS (OR = 1.023 [1.012-1.044], p &lt; 0.001), ventilator days (OR = 0.966 [0.944-0.988], p = 0.003), obesity (OR = 1.464 [1.137-1.886], p = 0.003), and PC consult (OR = 4.475 [1.008-1.024], p &lt; 0.001), which effect increased over time (log rank test p &lt; 0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our data show that the increase in PC consultation mirrors the mortality increase. PC is consulted more often on younger and/or less severely injured patients, specifically patients with no or less severe head injuries. This may be partly explained by a societal movement to increase and improve end of life care discussions with patients and families. Further investigation into standardizing the approach to PC involvement is needed.&nbsp;

Fox<sup>1</sup>, S. B. Holsten<sup>1</sup>, C. Q. White<sup>1</sup>, A. Lawson<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Medical College Of Georgia,Augusta, GA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The Hands-Free Georgia Law (HB673), implemented July 1, 2018, was designed to prevent motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) by banning drivers from using their hands for non-driving related activities, most notably cell phone use. HB673 initially received widespread acclaim for its hardline stance on texting while driving. This study aims to investigate the effects of this law on trauma activations secondary to MVCs in the state of Georgia.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The Georgia Trauma Registry was queried to obtain data regarding MVCs in Georgia for 2017-2019, representing the 18 months immediately prior to, and following implementation of, the Hands-Free Law. Data collected focused on the absolute number of MVCs for each time period and severity of MVC as designated by the average injury severity score (ISS) for each individual trauma case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In the 18 months prior to implementation, a total of 43,080 traumas were recorded in the Georgia Trauma Registry, of which 11,111 (25.8%) were attributed to an MVC. The average ISS was 12.1(95% CI 12.0-12.3). Following implementation, of 51,331 trauma cases reported 12,130 (23.6%) occurred secondary to MVCs, with an average ISS of 11.7 (95% CI 11.5-11.9). There was a significant (p&lt;0.0001) decrease in ISS per trauma of 0.4. There was an increase in statewide MVC-related traumas per 1000 residents from 1.07 to 1.14 following enactment of HB673. There was also an increase in mortality rate per MVC from 4.10% to 4.15% following implementation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Since implementation, there was an overall increase in the number and frequency of MVC-related traumas as well as in overall statewide trauma. The average ISS experienced a mild, but significant overall decrease. This indicates the Hands-Free Georgia has not been entirely successful at preventing injury caused by distracted driving. A more comprehensive program should be explored to target this issue.

While anticoagulation therapy (ACT) in trauma patients has been implicated as a risk factor for bleeding, the impact of ACT on the outcomes of cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI) has not been addressed. The aim of this study was to examine if ACT was associated with worse outcomes following CSCI.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This IRB-approved retrospective cohort study included 255 CSCI patients with corresponding neurological deficit admitted to one of three Level 1 Trauma Centers between 2015 and 2020. Patients (n=62) on pre-injury ACT (PACT) were compared to patients (n=193) not on pre-injury ACT (NPACT). Analyzed variables included: age, comorbidities, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for spine, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment grade, neurological level of injury (NLI), presence of cervical vertebral fracture, facet dislocation, paravertebral hematoma (PVH), incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI), need for blood transfusion, requirement for mechanical ventilation (MV), and rates of ICU admission and mortality.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The PACT group was significantly older (75.0 vs 52.1) and comprised mainly of geriatric patients (82.3% vs 27.5%), defined as &ge;65 years old, with a higher incidence of comorbidities (95.2% vs 57.5%), all p&lt;0.001. The groups were comparably injured, as they had no difference in mean ISS (19.2 vs 21.6, p=0.2), AIS for spine (p=0.2), ASIA impairment grade (p=0.3), or NLI (p=0.5). There was no difference in prevalence of cervical spine vertebral fracture (56.5% vs 54.9%, p=0.8), facet dislocation (17.7% vs 23.3%, p=0.4), or TBI (6.5% vs 6.2%, p=0.9). Paravertebral hematoma&nbsp;resulted in spinal cord impingement in 80% of all patients, with a significant rate of PVH development (45.2% vs 25.4%, p=0.003) in the PACT group [Fig. 1]. Multivariable analysis confirmed PACT as a statistically significant (p=0.005) predictor for PVH formation. Significantly more patients in the PACT group required packed red blood cell transfusions within the first 24 hours of admission (25.8% vs 10.4%, p=0.002) and had more transfusions throughout their hospital stay (46.8% vs 25.4%, p=0.001). The necessity for MV (30.6% vs 35.8%, p=0.5) or ICU admission (75.8% vs 74.1%, p=0.8) were similar in groups. However, 30-day post-discharge mortality was significantly higher in the PACT group (16.1% vs 6.7%, p=0.03).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Patients with cervical spinal cord injury and neurological deficits on pre-injury anticoagulation therapy were older and had more comorbidities. Pre-injury anticoagulation in CSCI patients with neurological deficits was found to be a risk factor for an increased transfusion requirement, the development of a paravertebral hematoma, and a higher 30-day post-discharge mortality rate.

Early identification of blood product requirements may aid in optimizing the clinical decision-making process while improving trauma related outcomes. This study aimed to assess and compare multiple machine learning models for predicting patients at&nbsp;highest risk for massive transfusion on the battlefield.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Supervised machine learning approaches using logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), and random forest (RF) techniques were used to create predictive models for massive transfusion using standard prehospital and arrival datapoints from the Department of Defense Trauma Registry, 2008-2016. 70% of the population was used for model development and performance was validated using the remaining 30%. Models were tested for accuracy and compared by standard performance statistics.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;22,158 patients (97% male, 58% penetrating injury, median age 25-29 years old, average ISS 9, with an overall mortality of 3%) were included in the analysis.

Following cross validation and model training, the random forest model outperformed the alternatively tested models (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Machine learning techniques may allow for more optimal and rapid identification of combat trauma patients at highest risk for massive transfusion. These powerful approaches&nbsp;may uncover novel correlations and help improve triage, activation of massive transfusion resources, and trauma-related outcomes.

Carter<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Maine Medical Center,Surgery,Portland, MAINE, USA <sup>2</sup>Maine Medical Center,Trauma And Surgical Critical Care,Portland, ME, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

In rural settings, factors such as weather, emergency services availability and location can significantly impact total prehospital time and thus survival after injury. We sought to determine what prehospital conditions affect mortality and morbidity in severely injured patients. We hypothesized that shorter pre-hospital clinical and weather would predict trauma patient in-hospital morbidity and mortality.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We retrospectively reviewed the trauma registry at the only level 1 trauma center in Maine, a rural American state. We extracted demographic, clinical, and geospatial data for each trauma patient and linked weather conditions using data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database. A sub-analysis of patients with low Glasgow Coma Score (GCS&le; 9), hypotension (SBP&le; 90mmHg), or both, was conducted to identify the effect of weather and prehospital conditions on patient outcomes including ICU admission, need for emergent surgery and mortality. We used the student&rsquo;s t-test, Chi-Square, ANOVA, Bonferroni tests, Kruskall-Wallis, and Dunn tests for data analysis. Lastly, we built bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models to predict ED and in-hospital mortality using Stata version 11.0

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Over the three-year study period, 442 subjects were captured. These were predominantly middle-aged (median 52 years [IQR 33, 67]) Caucasian (98%) males (71%) transferred from an outside hospital (54%) with an injury severity score above 15 (56%). Falls (36%) and motor vehicle collisions (33%) were the commonest injury mechanisms with a smaller incidence of burns (8%) and penetrating trauma (9%).

The median time on the scene (field time) was 15 minutes [IQR =10, 20.5]. Ground ambulance (85%) and helicopter (7%) were the most common transport methods. The median time to definitive care was 129 minutes [IQR= 61, 247]. Patients with field GCS &le; 9 had higher odds of ICU admission (OR=2, p=0.029). Hypotension in the field was the single greatest predictor of ED mortality (OR=11, p=0.004). Other predictors of in-hospital mortality were ISS &gt;15 (OR=3, p=0.006) and field hypoxia (OR=3, p=0.007).

Among trauma transfers, increasing prehospital time correlated with ED mortality while injury during warmer weather showed lower odds (OR =0.94, p=0.019) of in-hospital mortality. For patients that presented directly from the field, no weather condition (temperature, snow, visibility, sky conditions, precipitation, humidity, or sleet) predicted mortality.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

This study shows that among severely injured patients in our rural catchment area, being injured during cold weather was associated with higher in-hospital mortality among trauma transfer patients. Prehospital blood pressure, pulse oximetry, GCS (hypotension, hypoxia, GCS) are predictors of inpatient mortality. Future analysis will explore other factors impacting transport and field time in order to improve outcomes in our rural setting.

The aim of this study was to assess whether hospital volume is associated with surgical outcomes in gastric cancer, and what threshold of case volume meaningfully impacts operative outcomes and survival.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We identified adult patients with stage I-III gastric adenocarcinoma undergoing gastrectomy between 2004-2015 in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model with restricted cubic splines (RCS) was used to examine the association of annual hospital gastrectomy volume and overall survival, after adjusting for demographic and clinicopathologic factors. The average annual gastrectomy volume was calculated as the number of gastric cancer cases treated at a given facility divided by the number of years the facility had participated in the NCDB. Our RCS model identified 2 ranges of values of average annual gastrectomy volume that corresponded to changes in the log hazard ratio. Further analysis was conducted with bootstrap simulation that estimated 17 cases/year as the cut point that corresponded to maximum change in log hazard ratio. On the basis of this estimated cut point, hospitals were divided into HV (&ge;&nbsp;17 cases/year) and low volume (LV, &lt;17 cases/year) groups. Patients with missing data capture of surgical margins, lymph node exam, or date of last contact/death, and those treated at facilities that contributed &lt;1 case/year, were excluded. Chi-square tests were used to analyze group differences. Logistic regression was utilized to assess the impact of hospital volume on surgical outcomes. Kaplan-Meier and Cox Proportional Hazard methods were used for survival analysis. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our final cohort consisted of 27,910 patients (8.3% treated at HV center). All HV centers were academic centers. Patients treated at LV centers were more likely to be minority race/ethnicity, uninsured, and live in census tracts with lower median incomes and education levels. Compared to LV centers, treatment at a HV center was associated with an increased likelihood of adequate lymph node examination of 15 nodes (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.90-2.28) and decreased thirty- and ninety-day postoperative mortality (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.89 and OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85; respectively) after adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidities, and stage. For all stages combined, treatment at a HV center was associated with a survival advantage (median overall survival 47.6 vs 45.0 months; p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Treatment at a HV gastrectomy center is associated with significantly improved surgical outcomes. Our study identified 17 cases/year as a clinically meaningful distinction between HV and LV centers. This definition of a HV center should be considered when evaluating regionalization of gastric cancer care to improve patient outcomes.&nbsp;

While higher volume centers (HVC) have been associated with improved post-surgical outcomes overall, the impact of surgical volume on racial disparities in oncologic surgery is less defined.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who underwent surgical resection for stage I-III esophagogastric, pancreatic, or rectal adenocarcinoma from the 2004-2015 National Cancer Database were divided into cohorts based on race and hospital surgical volume as defined by Leapfrog Group guidelines. Outcomes were analyzed following 1:1 propensity-score matching using adjusted logistic, Poisson, and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis with marginal effects.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Between 2004-2015, 103,846 (90.5%) Non-Black Non-Hispanic (NBNH) and 10,926 (9.5%) Black Non-Hispanic (BNH) patients underwent surgical resection. Following 1:1 matching, 77% of NBNH (N=10,695) and BNH underwent resection at an HVC. Ninety-day mortality was reduced in both NBNH (average marginal effects [AME] -0.01, p 0.004) and BNH (AME -0.02, p 0.001) when comparing HVC patients to low volume center (LVC) patients both overall and in pancreatic cancer, but not in esophagogastric or rectal cancer. Length of stay was significantly longer for BNH as compared to NBNH patients with rectal cancer in both LVC (AME 1.17, p&lt;0.001) and HVC (AME 1.49, p&lt;0.001) but was shorter for esophagogastric (AME -0.80, p&lt;0.001; AME -0.38, p 0.003) and pancreatic (AME -1.53, p&lt;0.001; AME -1.45, p&lt;0.001) cancers, respectively. BNH patients with rectal cancer demonstrated worse OS as compared to NBNH patients with rectal cancer following covariate adjustment when treated at an LVC (AME 4.01, p 0.043), but this survival difference between BNH and NBNH patients disappeared when treatment occurred at an HVC (AME 1.61, p 0.159).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Racial disparities in long-term survival outcomes appear to be more pronounced in LVC versus HVC settings for patients with rectal cancer. Further study is needed to better understand the complex relationship between hospital volume and racial disparity in abdominal cancer outcomes in order to develop strategies to resolve these differences.

We present a large multicenter study correlating regression with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis and melanoma-specific survival (MSS).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group database was reviewed from 1998 to 2018.Patients with known regression and SLN status were included. Clinicopathologic factors were correlated with regression, SLN status and MSS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In total, there were 4790 patients, with an overall median follow-up of 39.6 months and a median age of 58.9 years. Median thickness, minimum thickness and range were 1.4 mm, 0.1 mm, 52.9 mm, respectively. Overall, 495(10.3%) patients had T1a tumors. Regression was present in 1081 of 4790(22.6%) cases and 187 of 1081(17.3%) had T1a tumors. On multivariable analysis, significant predictors of regression were male gender, tumors on the trunk, and decreasing thickness (all p&lt;0.05), while tumors on the head/neck or lower extremities were significantly less likely to have regression (p&lt;0.05). Positive SLN status correlated inversely with regression (p=0.0012). Overall, SLN metastases were seen in 798 of 4790 patients (16.7%), of which 125 of 798 cases (15.7%) had regression. Significant predictors of a positive SLN on multivariable analysis were male gender, tumors on the trunk or lower extremities, increasing thickness, ulceration,&nbsp;lymphovascular&nbsp;invasion (LVI), and&nbsp;microsatellitosis&nbsp;(all p&lt;0.05). Decreasing age was a predictor, and regression was a correlate of decreased risk of SLN disease (regression:OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54-0.85, p=0.0008; age:OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.98-0.99, p&lt;0.0001). Patients with regression had significantly better MSS(p&lt;0.001), with a 5-year MSS of 92.2% and 86.7% for patients with and without regression, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that increasing age, male gender, increasing thickness, ulceration, LVI and&nbsp;microsatellitosis&nbsp;significantly predicted worse MSS(all p&lt;0.05). Positive SLN correlated with poor MSS(p&lt;0.05). In contrast, the presence of regression correlated significantly with better MSS (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.99, p=0.043).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This is the largest retrospective multicenter study to evaluate regression in melanoma, and the results show that regression is seen more frequently with decreasing tumor thickness, in males and in tumors on the trunk, while regression is present at a significantly lower rate in head/neck and lower extremity tumors and in positive SLN cases. More importantly, regression is an independent and significant predictor of outcomes, correlates with lower SLN metastasis rate and better MSS. Our results show that regression is a favorable prognostic marker and has the potential to be used with other known prognostic markers to predict outcomes in patients with melanoma.

Patients with unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma&nbsp;(PDAC) may undergo palliative operations including intestinal or biliary bypass. The value of these procedures remains debated, and a recent survey of their postoperative mortality and complication rates is lacking.&nbsp;It remains unclear which patients present with prohibitive operative risk.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We used American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data from 2005-2018 to assess patients undergoing gastrojejunostomy (GJ), biliary bypass (BB), double bypass (DB), or explorative surgery alone (ES) for PDAC. Using multivariable logistic regression, we compared 30-day mortality and complications across procedures and over time periods (2005-2010, 2011-2014, and 2015-2018). We identified patient and operative factors associated with postoperative mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified 4,810 patients undergoing non-pancreatectomy operations for PDAC, including 978 (20.3%) GJ, 764 (15.9%) BB, 631 (13.1%) DB, and 2,437 (50.7%) ES. Adjusted 30-day mortality and serious complications respectively were 26.0% and 11.8% for GJ procedures, 26.4% and 7.9% for BB, 23.5% and 5.2% for DB compared to 5.6% and 13.0% for ES (p&lt;.001). Specific complications including any SSI, organ-space SSI, wound disruption, pneumonia, VTE, and post-operative reintubation were significantly higher for bypass procedures (Figure 1). Adjusted 30-day mortality did not change significantly over time (8.1% in 2005-2010, compared to 6.6% from 2015-2018, p=0.08). Independent risk factors for post-operative mortality included pre-op albumin &lt;3.5 (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.90-3.57), disseminated cancer (OR 2.06, 1.57-2.72), emergency operation (OR 2.00, 1.13-3.50), age &gt;74 (OR 1.95, 1.47-2.60), ASA class 4 (OR 1.94, 1.39-2.70), pre-op bleeding disorder (OR 1.72, 1.08-2.73), pre-op WBC &gt;10.6(1.81, 1.31-2.48), pre-op Hct &lt;30(1.45, 1.05-2.01), and INR &gt;1.2 (OR 1.52, 1.10-2.12). 30-day mortality after bypass procedures was 2% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, compared to 8% with 2-3 risk factors and 18% with 4 or more risk factors (p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Palliative bypass for PDAC has not become safer over time, and 30-day mortality and complications remain unacceptably high. The presence of multiple risk factors such as disseminated cancer, low albumin, bleeding disorders, age &gt;74 years, and emergent situations present prohibitive operative risk and alternative palliative measures should be pursued.

Despite the NCCN recommendations&nbsp;almost 40% of patients fail to receive systemic therapy. Return to Intended Oncologic Treatment&nbsp;(RIOT) has been proposed as a quality metric in care of these patients. Failure to RIOT may decrease the benefits of curative resection and decrease survival. In this study we sought to identify the frequency, the factors associated with failure to RIOT, and the impact on survival.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used as the data source. Patients diagnosed with head of the pancreas adenocarcinoma (PAC) between 2010-2016 were included in the study. The selection criteria were:&nbsp;age 18-90, stage IB, IIA, IIB, known grade, tumor size, nodal status, comorbidities, systemic treatment sequence (pre-operative, post-operative, peri-operative chemotherapy), known hospital stay, margin status, surgical approach (MIS vs open), type of institution and known survival. Binary logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with failure to RIOT. For each stage, Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis was performed to estimate and compare survival for failure to RIOT, and Cox regression models were used to correct for confounders and to demonstrate the impact of failure to RIOT on survival.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;10630 patients fit our criteria for data completeness. The rate of RIOT was 77.6% (8251). Logistic regression models showed increased risk of failure to RIOT with sex (female, p&lt;0.001), race (Hispanic, p=0.002), 2 or more comorbidities (p=0.001), stage (p&lt;0.001), and hospital stay (p&lt;0.001). However surgical approach (MIS, p=0.024), negative margins (p=0.048), and academic institutions (p=0.001) were associated with lower risk.&nbsp;Kaplan Meier Survival analysis showed RIOT to be significantly associated with longer survival (20.63 months vs 16.97 months, p&lt;0.001), and Cox regression analysis showed RIOT to be associated with lower hazard ratios at every stage (stage IB HR 0.715 p=0.001, Stage IIA HR 0.702 p&lt;0.001, Stage IIB HR 0.622 p&lt;0.001). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the other hand was associated with better survival in case of failure to RIOT.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Failure to RIOT was associated with worse survival in PAC. This was seen less in academic centers&nbsp;and the effect of failure to RIOT was seen to be compensated by administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These findings support RIOT as an independent factor in survival&nbsp;and emphasize importance of academic institutions for pancreatic cancer care and the possible benefit of neoadjuvant treatment in these patients.

Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) of the skin is a rare malignancy that is rising in incidence in the United States. Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) has been reported to decrease the risk of locoregional recurrence and improve overall survival, but clinical evidence of its efficacy is inconsistent. In addition, to our knowledge, adherence to RT guidelines is unknown.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for stage I/II MCC patients who have received surgical intervention from 2005-2016. The cohort was divided into two groups: patients who had indication(s) for adjuvant RT and patients who had no indication for RT based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. We created a binary variable of whether patients actually received RT or not. We captured demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, and clinical characteristics of MCC. Five-year survival rate was assessed using the Kaplan Meier method. For each group, chi-square test and logistic regression analysis examined differences between the patients who received RT and patients who did not receive RT.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified 6651 stage I/II MCC patients who have undergone surgical intervention. Within the cohort, 5694 (85.6%) met NCCN criteria for RT, of which 2786 (48.9%) received adjuvant RT and 2908 (51.1%) did not receive RT. &nbsp;957 (14.4%) did not meet criteria for RT, of which 408 (42.6%) received RT and 549 (57.4%) did not receive RT. Five-year overall survival advantage was identified for patients who received RT both when RT was indicated (59% vs 46.7% when no RT was received) and not indicated (77.5% vs 68% when no RT was received) (P &lt; .001). Among patients who had indication for RT, females were less likely than males to receive RT (OR 0.86, P &lt;.01); patients over 75 years old were less likely to receive RT than younger patients (OR 0.63, P &lt;.001); patients with multiple comorbidities were less likely to receive RT than patients with no/few comorbidities (OR 0.73, P &lt;.01). Patients in comprehensive community cancer programs were more likely to receive RT than patients in academic/cancer research centers in both indicated and not indicated groups (OR 1.65, P &lt;.001 and OR 2.48, P &lt;.005, respectively).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Surgical resection with adjuvant RT has an overall survival benefit for local MCC. However, this study found certain groups are not receiving postoperative care concordant with NCCN guidelines: over 50% of patients did not receive RT when indicated and over 40% of patients received RT when not indicated. In addition, the survival benefit observed in patients who did not meet criteria for RT but received it warrants investigation. With the rise in incidence of MCC and in the associated survival benefit of multi-modality therapy, it is important to be aware of and further identify the socio-demographic and oncologic reasons for guideline non-adherence in the treatment of MCC.

Fonseca<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University of South Alabama,General Surgery,Mobile, AL, USA <sup>2</sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center,General Surgery,Houston, TX, USA","INTRODUCTION

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act facilitated Medicaid expansion in select geographic regions of the United Status.&nbsp; Limited data has linked the expansion of public health insurance with increased oncologic screening rates, early-stage diagnoses, and colorectal cancer survival.&nbsp; The aims of this study were to assess if Medicaid expansion was associated with an improvement in the treatment and outcomes of non-metastatic pancreatic cancer.

&nbsp;

METHODS

The National Cancer Database patients was queried for patients diagnosed with non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 2006 to&nbsp; 2016. Univariate associations were assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test for quantitative variables and the Pearson Chi-square test for categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was conducted for overall survival.

&nbsp;

RESULTS

This study identified 31,651 patients who met criteria, of which 15,410 patients received curative intent resection. Medicaid expansion was associated with increased likelihood of patients receiving curative intent resection (p &lt;0.001). Additionally, in the cohort of resected patients, Medicaid expansion was associated with receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (18.15% vs. 10.17%,p&lt;0.001), multiagent chemotherapy (29.09% vs.18.22%,p&lt;0.001), treatment at an academic center (65.30% vs. 60.87%,p=0.008), high volume center (63.83% vs. 36.17%,p&lt;0.001), decreased 30-day mortality (1.54% vs. 3.64%, p&lt;0.001) and decreased 90-day mortality (3.24% vs. 7.42%, p&lt; 0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that after controlling for variables including age, gender, race, facility type, insurance status, geographic location and demographic variables, Medicaid expansion was independently associated with the receipt of curative intent resection (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.54, p&lt;0.001), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OR 2.47, p&lt;0.001), multimodality treatment with surgery &amp; multiagent chemotherapy (OR 2.3, p&lt;0.001), treatment at a high volume center (OR 1.48, p&lt;0.001), decreased 30-day mortality (OR 0.49, p&lt;0.001) and decreased 90-day mortality (OR 0.46, p&lt;0.001). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that after adjusting for age, gender, race, facility type, insurance status, geographic location and demographic variables, Medicaid expansion status was associated with improved overall survival (OR 0.86, p=0.001).

&nbsp;

CONCLUSIONS

Medicaid expansion is associated with increased curative intent surgery in non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In resected patients, Medicaid expansion is associated with the receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, multimodality treatment at high volume centers, as well as improved 30-day and 90-day mortality and overall survival.

For surgical populations, readmission is primarily indicative of complications requiring inpatient management. Current readmission measures fail to capture emergency department encounters resulting in discharge (EDD), which may directly measure quality of post-discharge care by identifying patients who could have been managed in the outpatient setting. Our objectives were to (1) characterize the incidence of and reasons for EDD, (2) identify predictors of EDD, and (3) evaluate hospital variation in EDD among patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery for cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients who underwent gastrointestinal surgery for cancer from 2015-2016 were identified in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID) and State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD) for New York, Florida, and Maryland. The primary outcome was EDD within 30 days of discharge. The diagnoses most frequently associated with EDD were identified. A hierarchical multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to identify predictors and estimate hospital-specific odds ratios (OR) of EDD.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 34,120 patients from 402 hospitals underwent an esophageal (4.0%), gastric (5.9%) pancreatic (11.7%), hepatobiliary (11.7%), small bowel (2.7%), or colorectal (64.0%) operation for cancer. The overall rate of 30-day EDD was 8.1%, ranging from 7.1% following hepatobiliary to 13.3% following esophageal surgery. The most common reasons for EDD were pain (12.3%), wound care or complaints (11.9%), device/ostomy problems (11.8%), renal/GU complaints (8.4%), and general GI complaints (8.0%). EDD was less likely for older patients (OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.98-0.99] per year, p&lt;.01) and more likely for non-Hispanic Black compared to non-Hispanic White patients (OR 1.23 [95% CI 1.09-1.39], p&lt;.01) and for non-privately insured patients (Medicaid: OR 1.96 [95% CI 1.70-2.26], p&lt;.01, Medicare: OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.20-1.52], p&lt;.01, other: OR 1.39 [95% CI 1.11-1.76], p&lt;.01). Likelihood of EDD was also increased for patients who had esophageal (OR 1.83 [95% CI 1.53-2.18], p&lt;.01), gastric (OR 1.41 [95% CI 1.21-1.65], p&lt;.01), or pancreatic (OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.18-1.53], p&lt;.01) procedures versus colorectal operations. Among hospitals, the OR for EDD ranged from 0.61 (95% CI 0.47-0.79) to 1.89 (95% CI 1.26-2.86), with 4 hospitals (1.0%) performing better and 7 hospitals (1.7%) performing worse than expected.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
EDD occurs frequently after gastrointestinal surgery for cancer. Non-privately insured patients and certain racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by EDD and hospital rates of EDD vary widely. Many EDDs may be avoidable through improved post-discharge coordination and monitoring. EDD is a unique measure of post-discharge surgical quality and may be more actionable than current readmission indicators.

Despite the potential benefits of palliative surgery, its utilization in gastric cancer is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of gastrectomy and survival of patients with stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The National Cancer Database (2010-2016) was queried for cases of stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify patient and institutional characteristics predicting gastrectomy in patients with stage IV disease. Propensity scores were created for the odds of undergoing gastrectomy and patients were matched 1:1. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We identified 20,184 patients with clinical stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma, of which 1244 (6.2%) underwent gastrectomy. On multivariable logistic regression, patients were more likely to undergo gastrectomy if they were younger (OR 0.977, 95% CI 0.970-0.983, p&lt;0.0001), non-white (vs white OR 1.229, 95% CI 1.076-1.404, p=0.0024) or female (vs male OR 1.259, 95% CI 1.118-1.418, p=0.0001). Patients were also more likely to undergo gastrectomy if they lived in areas with lower rates of high school education (vs higher rates OR 1.310, 95% CI 1.086-1.579, p=0.0047) or private insurance (vs no insurance OR 1.587, 95% CI 1.223-2.060, p=0.0005). In addition, patients who underwent gastrectomy were more likely to have not received chemotherapy (vs chemotherapy OR 1.815, 95% CI 1.602-2.056, p&lt;0.0001). Before matching, median overall survival was 11.24 months for gastrectomy versus 5.13 months for those who did not undergo gastrectomy. After matching, median overall survival was 11.20 months for gastrectomy versus 4.17 months for those who did not undergo gastrectomy (log-rank, p&lt;0.0001) (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The use of palliation surgery has increased over the past several years. The findings of this study suggest that predictors of gastrectomy in stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma include age, gender, education and insurance status. Surgery may be underutilized in certain populations and could provide a survival benefit in well selected patients with stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma.

Potential benefits include its ability to influence perioperative treatment decisions, namely with respect to neoadjuvant treatment strategies. Using a large national cohort, we sought to identify the incidence of, and describe factors and outcomes associated with, PBx for non-metastatic, resectable RPS.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to perform a retrospective review from 2004 to 2015 of patients who underwent therapeutic surgical resection of non-metastatic RPS. Comparison was made between patients who did and did not undergo PBx of the primary tumor; excisional biopsies were excluded. Factors associated with PBx were analyzed with logistic regression, and factors associated with survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 2,210 patients with non-metastatic, resectable RPS, 993 (44.9%) underwent PBx. Pre-procedural factors significantly associated with PBx included tumor size &le;5cm (OR 1.7, p&lt;0.01), tumor size between 5 and 10cm (OR 1.4, p&lt;0.01), non-well differentiated liposarcoma histology (OR 2.0, p&lt;0.001) and treatment at an academic facility (OR 1.4, p&lt;0.01). Patients who underwent PBx were significantly more likely to receive neoadjuvant radiation (OR 8.5, p&lt;0.001) and neoadjuvant systemic therapy (OR 3.6, p&lt;0.001), and were more likely to undergo radical resection (OR 1.6, p&lt;0.001) (Table 1). Of these three post-procedural factors, receipt of neoadjuvant radiation was associated with a survival advantage (HR 0.76, p=0.03). 5-year overall survival (OS) was worse for those who underwent biopsy compared to those who did not (59.0% vs 62.9%, p=0.02), but PBx was not associated with overall survival (HR 1.1, p=0.19) by multivariate analysis. The proportion of patients who underwent PBx did not significantly differ from year to year over the study time period (p=0.31).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;A minority of patients undergo PBx. Smaller tumor size, treatment at an academic center, and concern for more aggressive histology is associated with the decision to pursue biopsy. Despite theoretical concerns of tumor seeding, PBx does not appear to negatively impact survival, and may indirectly improve outcomes in select patients with RPS by virtue of receipt of neoadjuvant therapy. These findings underscore the need to improve standardization of the pre-operative workup for patients with RPS.

We sought to assess existing operative reporting practices and identify potential compliance gaps in operative documentation for oncologic breast procedures at our institution.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Operative reports of SLNB and AD performed within our health system over a 12-month period (1/1/2018-12/31/2018) were reviewed. Records were processed chronologically until a maximum of 100 operative notes were reviewed (SLNB) or until the entire 2018 patient list was exhausted (AD). Two independent reviewers categorized operative notes as compliant if each of the required elements (for SLNB: what substrate was utilized (dye, radiotracer, and/or clips), as well as removal of all applicably abnormal nodes; for AD: boundaries of dissection, preservation of relevant nerves, and approach to level III nodes) was explicitly documented.&nbsp; The mean of reviewer scores and kappa statistics for interrater reliability were calculated. Data analysis was performed using R.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 100 SLNB operative reports were documented by 5 unique surgeons; a total of 89 AD reports were documented by 7 surgeons. Overall compliance with CoC standards was 66% for SLNB and 12% for AD. Rates of compliance varied by surgeon. Among surgeons performing SLNB, compliance ranged from 6% to 100%. The most common missing elements were documentation that all colored nodes or non-colored nodes present at the end of dye-filled lymphatic channels and/or all significantly radioactive nodes were removed when dye/radiotracer were used. Among surgeons performing AD, compliance ranged from zero to 47%. The most common missing elements were documentation of attempts to spare the intercostobrachial nerve or whether level III nodes were removed. Interrater reliability was substantial, with kappa 0.77 and 0.78 for SLNB and AD, respectively.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this study, we found significant variability between both surgeons and procedures in current operative documentation of common breast oncology procedures.&nbsp; Compliance was notably lower in AD than SLNB.&nbsp; Interrater reliability was substantial, suggesting that our data is reproducible. Future work will investigate the value of a standardized documentation tool in improving synoptic operative report compliance.

While many data points are structured and easily retrievable from the electronic health record (EHR) systems, other relevant clinical information is more difficult to reliably retrieve due to its inclusion in free-text notes. For cancer patients, the text in non-synoptic pathology reports and provider notes are common sources that may be missed with traditional chart review. Moreover, International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes within the EHR may be ambiguous, making it difficult to identify the maximum number of patients with these conditions. We sought to explore if the Electronic Medical Records Search Engine (EMERSE), a highly robust clinical text mining tool, could meaningfully augment the manual chart review process for patients with cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (cLMS), a rare sarcoma of the skin and soft tissue.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  EMERSE allows users to define single-word and multi-word phrases to search over 80 million free-text clinical documents from the EHR of our large tertiary care health system. We used terms such as &ldquo;leiomyosarcoma&rdquo; and &ldquo;cutaneous leiomyosarcoma&rdquo; along with specifiers like keyword proximity (distance of each term in a single document) as well as other identifiers&nbsp;(e.g. &ldquo;dermal&rdquo; and &ldquo;subcutaneous&rdquo;) to generate a list of potential cLMS patients. To assess how many true cLMS patients were identified using EMERSE, we manually chart reviewed the list and also obtained the associated ICD-0-3 tumor and primary site classification from the institutional Cancer Registry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From EMERSE we identified 311 potential cLMS candidates in the EHR. Through chart review, 140 patients were deemed to have cLMS. However, only 101 patients of the 140 were identified by ICD-0-3 classification in the Cancer Registry. If only traditional ICD-codes were used to query the 311 patient cohort, nearly 28% of the positive cLMS patients found by chart review would have been missed. The remaining 173 false positives captured by EMERSE was mainly due to standardized language from genetic consult notes stating, &ldquo;risk for cutaneous leiomyosarcoma&rdquo;.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study demonstrates how EMERSE can be used as an efficient and sensitive method for identifying patients with a rare cancer diagnosis directly from free-text clinical notes. Although use of EMERSE had significant false positives it still managed to detect patients who may otherwise have been missed by traditional methods of querying. Applying more granular search criteria that excludes standardized language may yield even better results. For larger, multi-institutional studies, this type of resource could prove to be an advantageous approach for cohort research studies on rare pathologic diagnoses.

Historical surgical data warns against abdominal surgery in patients with cirrhosis (CP) due to increased morbidity and mortality. However, these published mortality rates may not represent modern medical practices.&nbsp; We postulate more CP are undergoing major abdominal surgery however a paucity of data remains on outcomes. This project aimed to identify trends in mortality and morbidity among patients with cirrhosis undergoing major non-transplant, non-hepatic cancer surgery and to quantify the increase in such cases over time.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried for patients undergoing both open and minimally invasive pancreatectomy, colectomy, esophagectomy, gastrectomy, or pulmonary resection from 2005-2015. Inclusion criteria were met for 928,156 patients. Of these 7647 (0.8%) were cirrhotic. Propensity matching of non-cirrhotic patients (NCP) was performed on the basis of demographics and comorbidities. Mortality over time and differences in outcomes were compared using a conditional logistic regression model.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
For all procedures, the number of major operations performed on CP increased over time (odds ratio for year 1.01 (1.00-1.02, P=0.031), while overall mortality decreased for all surgical cases in NCP (HR 0.94 (0.93-0.94, p&lt;0.001) and even more so in CP (HR 0.93 (0.91-0.95, p&lt;0.001) over time; indicating that for every one year increase in time the odds of mortality decreased by 6% in NCP and 7% in CP. In the propensity matched analysis, CP had an increased length of stay (median of 9 versus 8 days, p&lt;0.001), rate of inpatient mortality (12.8% versus 5.6%, p&lt;0.001), were more likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility (22.3% versus 18.1%) and less likely to be a routine discharge (60.1% v. 53.8%, overall p&lt;0.001) as compared to non-cirrhotic patients. CP did not have a clinically significant increase in complications.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The number of major operations performed on CP increased over time despite higher mortality as compared to NCP. Overall mortality for major operations in CP also decreased over time and at a faster rate than in NCP. Although cirrhosis remains a significant comorbidity, more major operations are being performed on this patient population, complications were not increased and survival outcomes may be improving.

Demographic and clinical data was abstracted.&nbsp;The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease-free interval (DFI), and progression free survival (PFS). Kaplan Meier survival analysis was performed. Cox proportional hazards regression evaluated associations between survival and clinical characteristics.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 33 subjects in the multi-institutional cohort the median OS was 8.6 years. The median DFI from diagnosis of the primary tumor to adrenal metastasis was 3.2 years (IQR:1.1,9.0). On Cox regression analysis, size of adrenal metastasis (HR:1.207, p=0.0383) and oligometastases (&gt;1 and &le;5 metastases) at primary diagnosis (HR:2.906, p=0.0453) were associated with higher rates of recurrence. Granular treatment data was available for a single institution subgroup (n=11). The mean age at initial melanoma diagnosis was 52.7&plusmn;10.8 years. 37.5% of the primaries were T1a (n=3), 25.0% were T2a (n=2), and 12.5% each were T2b, T3b, and T4b. Mean primary tumor depth was 2.6&plusmn;3.2mm, 87.5% had mitoses present, and 42.9% demonstrated ulceration. Two patients had tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The mean DFI from primary tumor to adrenal metastasis was 4.6&plusmn;2.5 years. 36% were oligometastatic at the time of the first metastasis to any location. Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab was administered in 1 patient. Surgery was the most common treatment for metastases to any location (81.8% of first metastasis, n=9; 80.0% of second metastasis, n=8; 66.7% of third metastasis, n=4; 100.0% fourth metastasis, n=2). Adrenal metastasectomy was performed with curative intent in 72.7%, and for diagnostic purposes in 27.3% of patients. Adjuvant therapy included chemotherapy (n=3), radiation (n=4), targeted therapy (n=2), and immunotherapy (n=6). Median OS was 16.37 (IQR:12.7, NR) years (Fig. 1A). After adrenal metastasectomy, median PFS was 0.4 (IQR 0.3,7.9) years (Fig. 1B).&nbsp;45.5% of patients had no evidence of disease at their last follow-up.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Multi-modality oncologic therapy in the current era of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapy may include multiple metastasectomies. Although recurrences are common, long-term survival is observed in selected patients undergoing adrenal metastasectomy for melanoma.&nbsp;OS in a single institution subgroup was longer than the multi-institutional cohort, potentially reflecting patient selection.

Dossett<sup>3,4</sup> <sup>1</sup>Dartmouth Medical School,Hanover, NH, USA <sup>2</sup>University of Michigan Medical School,Ann Arbor, MI, USA <sup>3</sup>University of Michigan Center for Health Care Outcomes & Policy,Department Of Surgery,Ann Arbor, MI, USA <sup>4</sup>University Of Michigan,Department Of Surgery,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Health disparities in cancer disproportionately affect minority patients and arise due to sustained systemic racism in society. Minority patients receive less guideline-concordant care, report greater dissatisfaction with treatment outcomes, and participate less in shared decision-making. Without language translation services, minority patients with cancer face challenges accessing and understanding their diagnoses, affecting&nbsp;active participation in decision-making. Recognizing patients seek information online, cancer centers provide web-based information to complement what is provided in person. However, the extent to which hospital cancer websites target information to diverse populations is unknown and presents an opportunity to understand how we engage minority patients in their treatment.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We reviewed the websites of the U.S. News &amp; World Report&rsquo;s top 25 &ldquo;Best Hospitals for Cancer&rdquo; to characterize how treatment-related information is communicated to patients seeking online resources in languages other than English. We assessed websites&rsquo; translation services and the extent of translated material available. &nbsp;Given videos and visual aids can overcome language barriers and enhance patients&rsquo; understanding of treatment-related material, we evaluated the videos and visuals available on these websites for breast and colon cancer.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 25 websites accessed, 40% (n=10) offered language translation functions, three of which were through Google Translate. Two websites with language translation capabilities only offered hospital information translation (e.g. &ldquo;Preparing for your visit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Food services available,&rdquo; &ldquo;Parking &amp; Visiting Hours&rdquo;) but did not include translation of cancer-specific information. Patient educational videos were available on 76% (n=19) of hospitals&rsquo; breast cancer webpages and 48% (n=12) of colon cancer webpages. No videos featured language translation options. Visual aids were utilized by 60% (n=15) of the breast cancer webpages and 60% (n=15) of the colon cancer webpages. Most visual aids were diagrams without language translation (e.g. anatomical graphics).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Cancer care aims to employ shared decision-making to navigate the complex and varied treatment options. Hospitals provide substantial treatment-related information on their websites to engage patients in the decision-making process. However, the lack of translated educational material online represents a gap contributing to compromised dissemination of cancer-related information to minority patients. To provide important clinical information to all patients, website language translation should be comprehensive, encompassing disease-specific information and utilizing multi-lingual video and visual aids when appropriate. Ultimately, hospital websites should strive to build equitable information platforms to facilitate the dismantling of structural racism contributing to health disparities in cancer care.

Demonstration of improved patient safety and treatment outcomes has led to regionalization of complex surgical oncology procedures to high-volume centers which are often located in urban areas. This trend can have unintended negative consequences for rural patients, their families, and rural health care systems. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a complex procedure for which data is available regarding volume-outcome relationships. We hypothesize that outcomes following PD performed at an appropriately-resourced rural health care facility are comparable to published national standards, which have been reported mostly by large urban academic institutions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective review was conducted of a prospectively-maintained, single-institution database of pancreatic resections. We extracted demographic, surgical, and hospitalization-related information from patients who underwent PD between October 2007 and February 2019. Primary outcomes were the 90-day rates of patient mortality and morbidity. Secondary outcomes were the 30- and 90-day rates of hospital readmission, indications for readmission, and statistical associations between readmission and clinical variables. Institutional hospital readmission rates were compared to published national data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

118 patients met study criteria. Half of the patients were female (n=58, 49.2%), and the mean age was 64.6 years. Almost all surgeries were performed by a fellowship-trained surgical oncologist or hepatobiliary surgeon (n=113, 95.8%). There was one death (0.9%). 41 patients (34.7%) had a postoperative complication. The most common complication was pancreatic fistula / leak (n=23, 19.5%). The institution-specific 30- and 90-day readmission rates were 14.41% and 24.58%, respectively. The most common reason for readmission was deep space infection (n=7, 24.1%). The only clinical variable statistically associated with hospital readmission at 90 days was the requirement for a blood transfusion (41.4% of patients readmitted vs 9.0% of patients not readmitted, p=0.016). A meta-analysis published in 2018 reporting data from almost 20,000 patients found a mean 30-day readmission rate of 17.63% and a mean 90-day readmission rate of 26.14%. These rates were statistically similar to our institutional data, with p-values of 0.36 and 0.70, respectively.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

PD is a complex operation with historically high morbidity and mortality. Regionalization of these cases to high-volume hospitals and high-volume surgeons has improved surgical outcomes, but this trend has tended to concentrate pancreatic surgery, especially PD, to urban hospitals. Our data show that comparable patient safety and surgical outcomes are possible in appropriately-resourced rural hospitals with properly-trained staff and high case volumes. Medical professionals and the public can be reassured that high-quality care for complex surgical oncology patients is accessible outside of major metropolitan areas.

Associations with other cancers, including breast cancer, have been suggested. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of SDH PVs in patients undergoing multigene testing for cancer.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients ages 18-90 years old who underwent multigene panel testing for cancer predisposition genes (Ambry Genetics, Aliso Viejo, CA) between March 2012 to December 2016 were included in Interactive Prevalence Tables (www.ambrygen.com/providers/resources/prevalence-tool).&nbsp;The prevalence tables were queried to identify the association between SDH subunits (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD) and common cancers (breast, colorectal, endometrial or uterine, kidney, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, or thyroid). Frequency of PVs, cancer status, and cancer type were evaluated.&nbsp; Odds ratios (OR) for cancer were calculated; a p-value of &le;0.05 was considered significant.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 150,319 subjects included in the prevalence tool, 9,626 were tested for SDHx mutations. Within this cohort, 20 patients had SDHA PVs (0.21%), 27 SDHB PVs (0.28%), 10 SDHC PVs (0.10%), and 18 SDHD PVs (0.19%).&nbsp;When evaluating subjects by personal cancer history, of 41,058 subjects with no personal history of cancer, 2,704 were tested for SDHx.&nbsp; Of these, PVs were identified in 10 subjects (5 SDHA (0.18%), 5 SDHB (0.18%)). Of 102,824 subjects with a personal history of any cancer, 6,154 were tested for SDHx. In this subgroup, PVs were identified in 12 SDHA (0.19%), 12 SDHB (0.19%), 9 SDHD (0.15%), and 4 SDHC (0.06%).&nbsp;When analyzing patients by cancer type, breast cancer was the only cancer in which&nbsp;SDHx PVs were identified at &ge;0.01%prevalence.&nbsp;Of the 79,368 subjects with a personal history of breast cancer, 4,010 were tested for SDHx. Germline PVs were 8 SDHA (0.2%), 7 SDHB (0.17%), and 6 SDHD (0.15%). Compared with patients with no SDHx PVs, PVs in neither SDHA (OR: 1.055, p=1.000) nor SDHB (OR: 1.055, p=1.000) were associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer of any type. In breast cancer specifically, compared with patients with no SDHx PVs, PVs in neither SDHA (OR: 1.079, p=1.000) nor SDHB (OR: 0.944, p=1.000) were associated with a statistically significant risk of breast cancer.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;In this study of subjects undergoing multigene panel testing for hereditary cancers, patients with no personal history of cancer&nbsp;in general, or breast cancer specifically did not have higher prevalence of SDH PVs.&nbsp;Further investigations are required to determine the SDH-associated cancer risk, compared to reference populations.

Tsilimigras<sup>1</sup>, T. M. Pawlik<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Ohio State University,Surgery,Columbus, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;The provision of spiritual care by an interprofessional healthcare team is an important, yet frequently neglected, component of patient-centered cancer care. In particular, providers may be uncertain about their role in patient spiritual care. We sought to define cancer care provider perspectives relative to spiritual care behaviors, as well as characterize how different members of the healthcare team perceive offering religious and spiritual (R&amp;S) care.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A cross-sectional R&amp;S survey was administered to healthcare providers (i.e. someone authorized to diagnose and/or treat physical or mental health disorders) employed at a large Comprehensive Cancer Center in the Midwest. Pearson&rsquo;s chi-square test was used to compare provider perspectives.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Among 340 participants, most participants were female (82.1%) and White (82.6%); median age was 35 years (IQR: 31-48). Providers included nurses (64.7%), physicians (17.9%), and &ldquo;other&rdquo; providers (17.4%). Most respondents identified as religious (57.5%), followed by spiritual (30.2%) or neither religious nor spiritual (12.3%). There was a difference in provider perceptions about discussing patient R&amp;S issues. Specifically, nurses more frequently inquired about R&amp;S (60.3%), while physicians were less likely (41.4%)(p=0.02). Among providers who did engage patients about R&amp;S, self-reported time spent on R&amp;S with patients (&ldquo;right amount&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;too little&rdquo;) was similar (nurses, 63.8% vs. physicians, 50.9%)(p=0.106). When faced with a patient in need of support, nurses more frequently used chaplaincy or another R&amp;S resource (65.5%), while physicians and other providers more often consulted psychology or psychiatry (57.1% and 47.5%, respectively; p&lt;0.001). Only 10% of physicians self-reported the belief that provision of spiritual care was within their role; in contrast, 25% and 64% of &ldquo;other&rdquo; providers and nurses reported that their role included providing spiritual care to patients (p=0.006). Perceived barriers to not discussing R&amp;S topics included potentially offending patients (56.5%) and time limitations (47.7%) (Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Health care providers markedly differed in their self-perceived roles to offer R&amp;S assistance in the clinical setting. Identifying barriers to providing services &ndash; including R&amp;S support &ndash; is critical to inform strategies to improve holistic care of cancer patients.

Syed<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University of California San Francisco,Department Of Surgery,San Francisco, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Given the challenge of training residents during COVID-19, we instituted virtual (exclusively by video conference) and hybrid (mixed video conference and limited small-group in-person coaching) sessions for open and laparoscopic skills. Synchronous instruction was provided to decentralized residents. We aimed to study feasibility, outcomes, and resident perceptions of these adaptations.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Residents participated via smartphone and webcam either individually at home or in small groups at clinical sites. First-year residents (R1s) received open skills kits for hybrid sessions; second-year residents (R2s) received laparoscopic practice boxes for virtual sessions. We assessed the following: feasibility by execution of planned sessions and attendance, outcomes by comparing video skills assignment scores with those of historic R1 cohorts since 2017, and perceptions by using web-based surveys distributed to 49 R1s and 13 R2s.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Feasibility: All skills sessions (7/7) and site-based small groups (20/20) were held as scheduled, despite two residents and three instructors quarantined. Attendance was 94% for hybrid (92/98 resident-sessions) and 76% for virtual (34/45 resident-sessions). Some hybrid sessions were converted to virtual due to instructor quarantines. 65% of small groups (13/20) had in-person coaching.

Outcomes: 49 R1s in the hybrid cohort and 135 R1s in historic cohorts completed 4 video skill assignments. One-handed square knot-tying scores significantly decreased from 42.5&plusmn;4.5 to 35.0&plusmn;7.3 (p&lt;0.001) out of 45, but scores were unchanged for three other skills: two-handed square knot-tying, instrument tying, and simple running suturing.

Perceptions: 76% (37/49) of R1s and 62% (8/13) of R2s responded to the survey. Of R1s, 90% (28/31) perceived hybrid sessions as safe for physical distancing and 10% (3/31) perceived them as possibly safe. 54% (15/28) felt sessions contributed to a sense of community. 88% (30/34) found the hybrid curriculum helpful; 12% (4/34) found it possibly helpful. Of R1s who experienced small groups with and without in-person coaching, 80% (8/10) found in-person coaching more helpful and 20% (2/10) felt it made no difference. Of R2s, 86% (6/7) found virtual sessions useful, 43% (3/7) found them equivalent to prior in-person sessions, and all felt they could put the developed skills into practice. Residents found the virtual modality convenient, effective for focused feedback, and helpful for observing peer skills and feedback. Broadly, residents favored returning to centralized in-person instruction when possible.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Virtual, synchronous, decentralized skills training is feasible with stable outcomes for most skills. One-handed knot-tying likely required tactile coaching. This model is an important adaptation to surgical training in the era of COVID-19 and can be applied to future challenges in delivering skills instruction, including outside of traditional skills lab facilities.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides research funding to scientists at different stages of their career through a range of grant awards. Early stage researchers are eligible for Career Development (K) awards, which are mentor-based awards that aid in the transition to independent&nbsp;funding, typically an R-series grant. Factors such as education, subspecialty, and time to funding have been studied as predictors of obtaining independent awards in some specialties. However, in surgery, the importance of these factors has yet to be clearly elucidated. We aim to identify predictors of K to independent award conversion among surgeon scientists to understand how to better support early stage researchers transitioning to independent careers.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
In July 2020, the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools database was queried for individuals affiliated with surgery departments who received NIH Career Development Awards (K01, K08, or K23) between 2010 and 2020. Data gathered include: year of the K award, number of manuscripts published using the K award, receipt of&nbsp;independent funding (I01, R01, R03, R34, R37, R41, R44, R56, or U01), number and years of independent awards, and total independent NIH funding. Demographics, including educational background, subspecialty, and the year of completion of clinical training, were collected using faculty biography webpages. Clinicians with an MD or equivalent degree who underwent surgical residency were included. Statistical significance was defined at p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Between 2010 and 2020, 127 surgeons received K Awards, of which 35 (28%) transitioned to independent funding. Of the 67 surgeons who received K awards prior to 2015, 29 (43%) successfully transitioned. 112 (88%) of the surgeons with K awards and 31 (88%) of those with independent awards trained in general surgery, with Trauma and Critical Care being the most common fellowship. 40% of those who converted, compared to 30% of those who did not, hold dual degrees. Furthermore, 40% of those who converted went from a K08 to an R01, making it the most common pathway. On average, surgeons received a K award 4.3 years after completing fellowship training and an independent award 4.4 years after receiving a K grant. The time to a K award did not predict independent funding, the number of independent grants, or independent funding amount. Those with independent funding had a significantly greater number of publications per year of their K-award (4.8 vs. 3.0, p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Surgeon scientists demonstrate success in transitioning to independent NIH awards; however, the timeline is extensive, taking approximately 9 years after the end of fellowship. Publication track record is the main factor contributing to successful conversion from a K award. As such, surgery departments should emphasize manuscript productivity and develop strategies to minimize time to independent funding to help K-awardees begin independent research careers.

Previous&nbsp;quantitative&nbsp;analysis found an &lsquo;ethics gap&rsquo; in the surgical literature compared to comparable medical journals. We wished to update this analysis to examine if the ethics gap has persisted and to detail what ethical issues surgeons are discussing in their literature to understand if ethics should become a larger component of continuing medical education.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;PubMed was examined from 2008 to 2018 for the MeSH term&nbsp;&ldquo;ethics&rdquo;. The top twelve impact factor journals in medicine and surgery were examined. Surgical articles were examined for the ethical concepts (autonomy, justice, beneficences and nonmaleficence), number of words used and specialty.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Medical journals had an average impact factor of 25.3 &plusmn; 23.9 and average number of ethics articles of 208.3 &plusmn; 264.8 while surgical journals had an average impact factor of 4.2 &plusmn; 2.4 and average number of articles of 19.1 &plusmn; 20.2 (p=0.006 for impact factor and p=0.03 for article count, t-test). Surgical journals had statistically higher mean word counts of 2100.8 &plusmn; 1285.4 compared to medical journals 1254.2 &plusmn; 1035.3 (p=0.0001, t-test).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Top impact factor surgical journals continue to statistically lag behind medical journals in describing ethical issues in practice. However, when surgical articles present ethical issues, they use more average words and more likely to have one of the four clinical ethical principles present in the content.&nbsp;These data should inform the surgical community of the need to describe and publish on ethical&nbsp;issues that are commonly found in surgical practice to close the previously described surgical ethics gap. These data should also guide potential topics for future continuing medical education focusing on surgical ethics to encourage more discussion, as well as demonstrate&nbsp;the importance of teaching surgical ethics at the undergraduate and graduate medical education level so students are exposed to these issues early on and are encouraged to contribute to the literature on surgical ethics during their careers.

At some point in their career, a surgeon will make an operative error. While post-operative coping strategies among surgeons have been identified, and medical errors have been found to have a significant impact on physicians, little research has considered the physical and psychological steps taken by a surgeon immediately after making an error in the operating room (OR). Hence, the first study aim is to assess for different types of intra-operative coping strategies along with post-operative coping strategies. While gender differences have emerged in research on surgeon psychological well-being, no research has investigated gender differences in operative coping strategies. Thus, the second study aim is to evaluate differences in how male and female surgeons cope with errors.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

An electronic survey was distributed to surgical faculty and trainees at three institutions. Variables included coping techniques after making an error in the OR. Participants were asked to report how effective their overall coping strategy was (5-point Likert scale, 1=not effective at all to 5=extremely effective), and whether they identified short term or long term effects on their own operative performance (5-point Likert scale, 1=very negative to 5=very positive). Chi-Square tests with a Bonferroni Correction were used to test for gender differences in coping strategies. Welch&rsquo;s t-tests were used to test for differences in views of coping.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 168 participants (56% male, 45% faculty) experienced an operative error and answered questions regarding coping strategies. There were significant differences between males and females in both intra- and post-operative coping strategies (Figure 1). Males (M=3.69/5, SE=.09) viewed their overall coping strategy as more effective than females (M=3.38/5, SE=.09), t(158.86)=2.47, p=.015. Females (M=2.47/5, SE=.08) were more likely to report that errors had a negative impact on their immediate subsequent performance compared to males (M=2.73/5, SE=.08), t(156.41)=2.32, p=.022. Males (M=3.68/5, SE=.07) were more likely to report a positive impact on their long term operative performance compared to females (M=3.45/5, SE=.09), t(145.10)=2.06, p=.042..


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

While both male and female surgeons reported making errors in the OR, there exist differences in the strategies surgeons use to cope with these mistakes. Importantly, females were more likely to view their coping strategies as less effective and identify the error as having a more negative impact on operative performance. These findings may provide important insight into prior work demonstrating that female surgeons experience burnout at higher rates and have poorer psychological well-being.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;An anonymous Web-based survey was created to assess federal debt, awareness of PSLF and participation, and PSLF influence on career choices. This was distributed to 2,483 residents of all specialties at three major academic medical centers.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;There were 934 respondents, yielding a response rate 37.6%. The median amount of debt was $230,000 [IQR $160,000-$300,000]. A total of 416/934 (44.5%) respondents were actively or planning on participating in the PSLF program with 175/934 (18.7%) belonging to a surgical specialty. There were no differences in amount of debt between surgical and non-surgical trainees ($223,778 [IQR $154,250-$300,000] versus $230,000 [IQR $163,000-$300,000], P=.305). Those belonging to a surgical specialty were more likely to be actively participating or planning to participate in the PSLF program when compared to medical specialties (53.1% versus 42.6%, P=.012). For those participating in PSLF, 82/416 (19.7%) either elected for longer training (academic years, additional training, etc.) or chose a less lucrative specialty in anticipation of receiving loan forgiveness; with no differences between surgical versus medical specialties (16.1% versus 20.7%, P=.376). The majority (70.4%, n=239/416) of PSLF participants did not take low success rates into account when deciding whether or not to participate in the program. A total of 275/934 (29.4%) respondents obtained and 437/934 (46.8%) wanted to receive formal training/lectures in regards to the PSLF program; with 15/934 (1.6%) respondents never knowing the program existed prior to the survey. Of those actively or planning on participating in the PSLF program, only 58/416 (13.9%) were able to correctly identify the qualifications/criteria to complete the program.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A large proportion of trainees are relying on the PSLF program for loan forgiveness. In addition, reliance on this program affects trainee decision making in regards to specialty choice and length of training. However, the majority of trainees do not appear to understand the qualifications/criteria of this program, which may be contributing to low success rates of the program. Residency programs should strongly consider providing a formal curriculum in finance and loan forgiveness to their trainees.

Corey<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Birmingham, Alabama, USA <sup>2</sup>Birmingham Veteran's Affairs Medical Center,Birmingham, AL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges to all aspects of clinical and operative activity as well as surgical education. As academic medical centers have pivoted to provide on-going education while appropriately socially distancing, virtual conferences have quickly become commonplace. While this technology has allowed for increased flexibility and the potential for greater inter-institutional collaboration, the change in format has not been without challenges, from technological to limited interpersonal interactions. As such, this study seeks to evaluate the overall effectiveness of virtual surgical grand rounds (VGR) using survey data from grand rounds attendees and attendance data from before and after the implementation of VGR.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Attendance data was compared from before and after the implementation of VGR at one large academic institution. Demographics of attendees that were recorded in attendance data include gender and academic rank. Additionally, a voluntary survey developed from prior data and analysis of focus groups regarding the effectiveness of surgical grand rounds was administered to attendees using Qualtrics survey software. Demographics of the survey participants were self-reported and included current academic rank, years in practice, and gender. Reponses and attendance rates were then compared across groups. All responses were anonymous.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Attendance at virtual grand rounds averaged 145 individuals versus 121 for in-person grand rounds (IGR). Of the survey results that were collected, 26% were from residents, 3% instructor/fellows, 20% assistant, 14% associate, and 20% professors. 65% of respondents were male, 32% female, and 3% preferred not to answer. IGR was considered to be moderately effective at disseminating knowledge by 69%, very effective by 14%, and 3% found it extremely effective. In contrast, VGR was considered to be moderately effective 37%, very effective by 34%, and extremely effective by 14%. VGR was more likely to be considered valuable with 37% rating it as very valuable versus 14% for IGR. Overall, 70% of individuals preferred VGR over IGR.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This study sought to define the audiences&rsquo; perception of virtual surgery grand rounds as compared to in-person surgery grand rounds. Overall, VGR was preferred by attendees, both male and female, when compared to in-person Grand rounds. VGR is perceived to be as effective or more at imparting knowledge and building a departmental identity as IGR. Increased attendance was also seen at VGR. These findings support maintaining some form of virtual Grand Rounds into the future.

Overdose deaths involving opioids are increasing in the United States. Patients are prescribed more opioid than required, and unneeded medications are abused. A majority of patients store and dispose of opioids improperly, partially due to gaps in knowledge.

Since 2017, the American Medical Association (AMA) has recommended three steps to increase appropriate storage and disposal of opioids by patients; talking with patients about proper use; reminding them to safely store; and urging disposal of unused medications.

We examine the personal use, storage, and disposal of narcotics by surgeons and evaluate how this modulates patient counseling.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

After institutional review board approval, we crafted a survey of provider opioid use, storage, and disposal patterns and patient counseling knowledge and behaviors, which was sent to all faculty surgeons at our institution. Statistical analyses were performed in R with student&rsquo;s t-tests, chi-squared tests, and Fisher&rsquo;s exact test.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The survey was distributed to 98 physicians with 30 responses (funding cap) in January 2020, for a 31% response rate. Respondents and non-respondents were similar in age, gender, and medical school graduation year; however, they differed in surgical specialty (Fisher&rsquo;s test, P = 0.01), with the bulk of respondents being general surgeons (43%).

In the last 5 years, 47% of respondents were prescribed an opioid, and 23% disposed of opioids. Thirty percent had unneeded opioids at home. The majority (73%) knew proper opioid disposal. Fewer respondents (67%) were comfortable counseling, and even fewer (17%) regularly provided disposal counseling. None reported supplying an opioid to family members or friends. Participants who regularly provided disposal counseling were more likely female (60% vs 12%, P = 0.04) but did not differ significantly from those who did not in any other assessed way.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

For the first time, we describe physician opioid use, storage, and disposal patterns and link this to knowledge, confidence, and patient counseling about opioid disposal. Physicians do not have ideal self-reported behaviors. Among only those prescribed opioids in the last 5 years, 57% reported having unneeded opioids in their homes and only 36% reported having disposed of opioids in the last 5 years.

The AMA recommends counseling patients regarding safe opioid storage and disposal. To our knowledge, there have been no studies examining implementation of this practice. Only 17% of surgeons endorsed regularly counseling on opioid disposal, while 67% felt comfortable having this conversation, demonstrating a knowledge and action gap.

Overall, future studies will link reported behaviors to prescribing practice and define the link between physician counseling and patient behaviors. This early pilot serves as a starting benchmark regarding physicians&rsquo; personal narcotic safety behaviors and counseling practices.

Although recent studies have raised concern that gender impacts resident operative participation, robust quantitative analyses are lacking. Robotic surgery offers embedded data to directly&nbsp;probe this question via percentage time trainees directly control the console (CONSOLE TIME). We sought to determine if trainee operative participation differed based on surgeon characteristics.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We&nbsp;retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected case-level&nbsp;robotic surgery data from a single institution, examining trainee console time and surgeon characteristics. Surgeon characteristics included trainee gender and PGY level, and attending gender, specialty, and experience: ESTABLISHED (5+ years) or EARLY CAREER (&lt;5 years). Only cases with an attending-trainee dyad that allowed identification of surgeon characteristic were included. We compared average&nbsp;trainee console time across these categories using 2-tailed t-tests or ANOVA. We developed a multivariable regression model to predict factors associated with increased operative participation by trainees.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Over a one-year study period, 777 robotic operations from 7 specialties met inclusion criteria. Most specialties had a specific procedure make up the majority of their robotic cases: 6/7 (85.7%) colorectal cases were partial colectomies, 19/33 (57.6%) thoracic surgery cases were lobectomies, 55/82 (67.0%) gynecology oncology cases and 20/37 (54.1%) gynecology cases were hysterectomy without nodal dissection. The most common procedure for urology was radical retropubic prostatectomy with node dissection 127/271 (49.6%), for general surgery it was cholecystectomy 94/287 (32.8%), and for surgical oncology it was adrenalectomy 8/60 (13.3%). 40 female trainees (62.5% of trainees) performed 312 (40.2%) of the analyzed operations while 13 female attendings (32.5% of surgeons) performed 112 (14.4%) of the analyzed operations. The majority of attendings (72.5%) were early career and performed 662 (85.6%) of the operations.

In univariate analysis (Table), increased trainee console time was significantly associated with female trainees, PGY7, and female attendings. In multivariate analysis, only trainee level and specialty maintained significance. Specific surgeon had the largest impact on univariate analysis, accounting for 46% of variance while specialty accounted for 24% of variance.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Differences in trainees&rsquo; robotic operative experiences appear primarily driven by specialty and trainee level, with individual surgeons&rsquo; practices being the most important factor. While these findings reflect practices at a single, relatively diverse institution and do not control for case complexity, we did not find female trainee gender or attending inexperience associated with decreased trainee participation.

M. Huffman<sup>1</sup>, D. Doster<sup>1</sup>, D. Stefanidis<sup>1</sup>, N. K. Lee<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Indiana University School Of Medicine,Surgery,Indianapolis, IN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Healthcare providers on the front lines during the COVID-19 pandemic may be experiencing heightened stress due to concerns about managing COVID positive patients, spreading illness to their families, among other factors. Resilience is a psychological factor defined by the ability to thrive in the face of adversity, cope effectively with stress, and maintain stable psychological functioning. Our team sought to determine if resilience was a protective factor against healthcare providers&rsquo; stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Following an iterative survey design process, the study team developed a 42-item survey examining providers&rsquo; psychological well-being, stress level, and sources of stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey also included the 2-item version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, which includes items related to a respondent&rsquo;s ability to adapt when changes occur and their tendency to bounce back after hardships. The survey was distributed to physicians, residents, and fellows at a large academic institution for departmental distribution among multiple departments including internal medicine and surgery, among several others. Survey results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate linear regressions adjusting for potential confounders such as role, specialty, resilience score, and years of experience.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Five hundred and ninety-seven clinicians (403 - 67.5% attendings, 40 - 6.7% fellows, 154 - 25.8% residents) completed the survey. We found that resilience was a predictor of significantly lower anxiety, change in stress, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and loss of professional identity since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (p&lt;0.01). Upon further analysis on the impact of the two resilience subscale items, adaptability and tendency to bounce back, we found that these aspects of resilience predicted significantly lower psychological disturbances since the start of COVID-19 (p&lt;0.05). However, the resilience factors were not predictive of less worry from providers about spreading illness to their families. When comparing surgeons (n=71) to internal medicine physicians (n=177), both groups were similar in years of professional experience (median of 10-14 years, p=0.870). Surgeons reported significantly lower anxiety/nervousness, change in stress, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and perceived ability to perform professional duties since the start of COVID-19 (p&lt;0.01).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In the current study, we found that resilience, including both adaptability to challenges and a tendency to bounce back from hardships, are predictive of lower psychological disturbances since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Surgeons reported lower psychological disturbances than internal medicine physicians, but less satisfaction with their roles since the start of COVID-19. Hospital systems should consider offering interventions to enhance healthcare providers&rsquo; resilience, including mental skills training.

Though the representation of women in medicine has been rising, surgery remains a male-dominated specialty, especially in leadership positions.&nbsp;Surgeon scientists who are a part of journal editorial boards generally hold distinguished academic and professional roles, and this position serves as a marker of accomplishment in the research world. However, it is unclear whether the representation of women in these positions is reflective of the field. Our goal is to examine the differences between the male and female composition of surgical editorial boards to better inform the sex disparity among surgeon scientists.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Surgical journals from the Clairvate Web of Science Group Master Journals List with impact factors greater than 2 were analyzed for editorial board composition. Surgical journal websites and faculty biography pages were used to record demographic information for U.S.-based members of each editorial board, including sex, education, and subspecialty. For each editor-in-chief, the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools database was searched for funding history between 1985 and 2020, and the Scopus database for H-index and number of publications. Statistical analysis was performed via t-tests and ANOVA; significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
52 surgical specialty journals with impact factors ranging from 2 to 10.668 were analyzed. 2980 editorial board members were identified, of which 593 (20%) were female and 2387 (80%) were male. On average, 19% of the editorial board members for each journal were female, with no significant difference based on impact factor.&nbsp;Of the 57 chief editors from these journals, 4 (7%) were female. 28% of male chief editors were either a Chair or Vice-chair of a surgical department, while 75% of the female editors held the same role. Additionally, there was a wider distribution of degrees among males, with 33% of males and 25% of females having additional non-MD degrees. All of the female chief editors and 96% of the male chief editors had published manuscripts, with an average H-index of 41 and 50, respectively. Comparison of the H-index or total number of publications showed no statistical difference between male and female chief editors.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The editorial board composition of the top surgery journals based on sex shows a bias towards male editors, similar to the composition of the surgery physician workforce. Women are not only further underrepresented in editor-in-chief positions, but female editors-in-chief also tend to hold&nbsp;higher academic titles than their male counterparts, suggesting that women may be held to a higher standard to reach the same position. Therefore, achieving sex equality among&nbsp;journal leadership can act as a mechanism for reducing the sex disparity in surgery and promote&nbsp;the engagement of female surgeon scientists in impactful research.

COVID-19 surge in the New York/New Jersey (NJ) metropolitan area necessitated a rapid expansion of ICU capacity and shift of work responsibilities for residents of all specialties.&nbsp; Concern exists about the effect the surge had on resident education, responsibility for patient care, and wellbeing.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We administered a survey to trainees at a single academic institution with multiple teaching hospitals in Northern NJ where an ACGME Stage 3 Emergency Pandemic Response status was declared in April and May 2020. The survey, consisting of Likert-like scales, was distributed electronically with the initial survey during the surge (DS) on 4/21/2020 and a follow-up survey after the surge (AS) on 6/21/2020.&nbsp; Data were analyzed using Chi square analysis to assess differences in responses over time.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
106 residents across ten specialties completed 129 surveys (77 responses for initial survey and 52 for follow-up).&nbsp; No differences were found between resident perceptions during and after the surge.&nbsp; The majority of residents who responded were rotating at the main hospital (65%) and were Medicine, Surgical, Anesthesia or Emergency Medicine Residents (73% DS, 83% AS).&nbsp; Nearly all residents (91% DS, 96% AS) felt that the pandemic impacted their education with the majority reporting negative consequences (69% DS, 77% AS). During the surge, residents reported increased or similar responsibility for patient care (Figure 1).&nbsp; While most residents felt prepared for their clinical duties, there was a decrease in feelings regarding preparedness after the surge. Feelings of being overwhelmed were noted on both DS and AS surveys.&nbsp; 50% of residents felt the pandemic put a strain on both their physical and mental health, and &gt;60% felt supported by their residency programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Residents perceived that COVID-19 negatively affected their education and mental/physical well-being. These opinions did not change once the surge ended.&nbsp; Since resurgence of COVID-19 infections is possible in the near future, programs must adapt to fulfill their educational mission. Training programs should work toward adequate preparedness, and should support physical and mental well-being both during and after pandemic crises.

The COVID-19 crisis has prompted the rapid adoption of telemedicine for almost all health care.&nbsp; We undertook this study to explore the perceptions of standardized patients (SPs) on the experience of receiving serious news in the telemedicine setting.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  &nbsp;Five SPs participated in a scenario wherein a medical student is asked to give serious news to the SP.&nbsp; Five students and one SP participated in a &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; role play and were asked to provide concerning test results to the SP while attending to the SP&rsquo;s emotional state and readiness, and developing a plan for next steps.&nbsp; All SPs received an emailed survey asking them to comment on the specific experience of receiving serious news remotely.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: &nbsp;Four (80%) SPs responded.&nbsp; SPs rated their ability to perform as patients highly (mean 4.75/5) and to provide feedback to student learners (mean 4/5).&nbsp; The perception of the SPs from the &ldquo;patient&rdquo; perspective is shown in the table below.&nbsp; SPs commented that the most difficult parts of receiving serious news in the telemedicine setting related to empathy: perhaps not recognizing subtle language or nonverbal cues, lack of touch, and the &ldquo;impersonal&rdquo; nature of a computer screen.&nbsp; All indicated that they would prefer to receive serious news in person.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: &nbsp;

SPs found that the cognitive aspects of medical visits could be readily accomplished via telemedicine.&nbsp; However, verbal and nonverbal expressions of empathy were not readily apparent in the virtual setting.&nbsp; Clinicians and patients should be aware of the limitations of the telemedicine setting and should consider strategies to foster strong relationships with patients in the virtual setting.&nbsp;

During the COVID-19 pandemic our&nbsp;hospital admitted over 600 COVID-19 patients, necessitating the creation of additional intensive care units (ICU) to accommodate the surge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgery residents were deployed in this &ldquo;surge&rdquo; schedule to care for the high influx of critically ill patients. We hypothesized that moral distress was prevalent among surgical residents during the pandemic.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a cross sectional observational study to assess moral distress in surgical residents at a single academic institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;We administered The Moral Distress for Health Care Professionals Survey (MMD-HP) to all residents in June 2020 following the COVID-19 peak in our region and the disbanding of our surge schedule. All residents deployed to an ICU were invited to attend a debriefing session led by a counselor. The MMD-HP is a 27-question survey that asks&nbsp;about frequency and level of distress for each scenario. It is scored from 0-432 with a score of&nbsp;&gt;168 representing a high level of moral distress.&nbsp;&nbsp;The debriefing session was analyzed qualitatively using the Sort and Sift method to identify themes.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 34 residents completed the survey. The mean score of moral distress was 106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost one fifth (18%) of residents met the threshold of having a high level of moral distress. The top five most&nbsp;distressing situations are described in Table 1. During the debriefing session, residents noted the &ldquo;no visitor policy&rdquo; prevented families from truly understanding the critical illness of their loved one resulting in prolonged futile care.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other sources of distress discussed included the lack of appropriately trained staff and uncertainty about the treatments used for this new virus. All participants in the debriefing session praised COVID specific education from faculty and emotional support from faculty and peers.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents experienced significant moral distress around providing futile care to patients. Peer support from fellow residents and emotional support from department leadership mitigates moral distress.

Gusev<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>East Carolina University Brody School Of Medicine,Greenville, NC, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Massachusetts Medical School,Worcester, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Research years during medical school are becoming increasingly common as students aim to strengthen their residency applications for competitive specialties. Surgical fields have long valued research, and the average number of research items per applicant has risen steadily over the past decade in general surgery and the subspecialties. Recent curricular changes in reaction to COVID-19, coupled with the upcoming transition to pass/fail USMLE Step 1 scoring, may place an even larger emphasis on research productivity in resident selection. Our aim was to assess pre- and post-COVID-19 views on research years among medical students pursuing surgical residencies, using urology as a proxy for competitive surgical fields.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;An anonymous 11-item survey was distributed via the online urology applicant Google spreadsheet in May 2020. Responses were collected over a 10-day period via convenience sampling. Items consisted of multiple-choice questions and 0-100 rating scales assessing interest in taking a research year, underlying motivations, career intentions, and basic demographics.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In total, 80 complete responses were collected. Precise response rate is difficult to discern due to convenience sampling; however, a very conservative estimate using the average number of applicants in the urology match from 2016-2020 yields a rate of 17.4% (80/460). Respondents were predominantly male (61%), aged 25-34 (93%), at US MD (84%) or DO (10%) institutions with a home urology program (88%), and applying for residency in the upcoming cycle (93%). Nearly half (44%) of respondents indicated that COVID-19, current academic policy changes, and/or uncertainty in the upcoming match had affected their interest in taking a research year. Of those, 89% indicated their interest in taking a research year had increased. Across all respondents, the pre-COVID-19 mean interest in taking a research year was 21/100; post-COVID-19 this rose to 31/100. In those who previously reported increased interest, scores rose from 34/100 to 54/100. Most frequently cited motivations for increased interest were to avoid the ban on away rotations, improve one&rsquo;s CV or ERAS application, and skip this year&rsquo;s match entirely. Interest in a future academic career or enjoying research activities were less often cited.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Medical students pursuing urology residency are significantly worried about this year&rsquo;s match due to academic changes and uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, their interest in pursuing a research year has markedly increased. Similar sentiments are likely present among applicants to other competitive surgical fields. Notably, interest in research itself appears less important to students while improving residency application strength is a primary concern. Given these findings, additional resources and opportunities for medical student research years in surgical fields may be needed to accommodate increased demand.

Tan<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University of Florida,Surgery,Gainesville, FL, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Florida,Office For Educational Affairs,Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  We developed a workshop to engage general surgery residents in quality improvement (QI) using the root cause analysis (RCA) model. The workshop allowed for a robust learning experience through a virtual platform to address important aspects of a frequently used QI tool in the systematic assessment of an adverse event.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A general surgery resident and a faculty moderator with experience in QI facilitated the workshop. A group of residents were actively engaged in the workshop. Facilitators followed a scripted model to teach important patient safety concepts with case presentations and application of the QI tools. During the workshop, participants reviewed two clinical cases and addressed key concepts of a RCA. A survey was created and administered pre and post workshop to assess knowledge and comfort with participating in one.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over the course of one academic year, the workshop was implemented 2 times with roughly 20 general surgery residents in attendance at each workshop. Participants completed a survey indicating that 73% learned something new, 69% felt they could apply the material to their work, and 76% would recommend the workshop to a colleague.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This 60-minute RCA workshop can provide hands-on QI experience in a standardized format to achieve the dual objectives of teaching QI to clinicians and allowing them to generate innovations. This stands as an effective way to expose residents to the RCA model for future application to practical clinical scenarios. &nbsp;The workshop will be repeated again with more residents in the future.

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly impacted healthcare delivery and strained medical training. This study explores resident and faculty attitudes regarding the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, reduced caseloads and redeployment on surgery, surgical subspecialty and anesthesia residency training in the epicenter of the pandemic in New York. We hypothesized that residents and faculty alike are concerned about resident technical skill decay and fulfillment of ACGME requirements, however are not concerned regarding the development of critical care skills and core competencies.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A web-based cross-sectional survey was distributed to residents and faculty at two large, urban academic medical centers of one health system in New York.&nbsp;Residents and teaching faculty of general surgery, plastic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, orthopaedic surgery, oral maxillofacial surgery, urology, podiatry, and anesthesiology programs were included.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The majority of residents (87% of 91) reported a significant impact on their training. Residents (82%) and faculty (94%) reported a significant reduction in case volumes due to the COVID pandemic (p&lt;0.001). 64% of residents reported a reduction in technical skills, and 75% of faculty perceived a decrease in resident technical skills. Residents expressed several concerns, including returning to the operating room with less skill, progressing to the next clinical year, practicing as independent physicians, and fulfilling case requirements. However, faculty were overall confident in residents&rsquo; ability to overcome a temporary decay in technical skill. Residents and faculty felt that resident critical care skills improved as a result of redeployment to care for COVID-19 patients (66% and 94%). Residents reported increased confidence in their ability to care for critically ill patients and positive impact on professional competency.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Irrespective of specialty, the majority of procedural and anesthesia residents perceived that their technical ability diminished but that their critical care skill improved. Faculty endorsed the perception of resident skill decay.&nbsp; However, they were confident in the ability of trainees to achieve level-appropriate proficiency. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on residency training are multi-dimensional.&nbsp; Longitudinal surveillance of residents may reveal the long lasting, if any, effects the COVID-19 crisis will have on core and specialty competency attainment.

Quinsey<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill,Department Of Neurosurgery,Chapel Hill, NC, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill,School Of Medicine,Chapel Hill, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Acting internships (AIs) have historically been a major mechanism in residency selection for students to gain better perspectives of the learning environment and culture of specific programs and for programs to match skilled, culturally well fit residents. The elimination of away rotations in 2020 poses unprecedented challenges in the upcoming match process. Virtual encounters do not readily give students an opportunity to showcase their surgical skill, ability to handle a stressful workload, nor performance under pressure. We conducted a 4 week virtual neurosurgical AI in order to determine what types of virtual experiences best allow students to get to know a program, develop neurosurgical knowledge and skills, and show characteristics of predicted surgical resident success.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Nine 4th year medical students from US medical schools participated in a 4 week virtual neurosurgery AI at UNC. The rotation was comprised of a variety of daily educational activities such as lectures, physical surgical skills sessions, interactive didactics, and live patient care. They were sent a survey at the beginning and end of the month to assess expectations and obtain feedback. Participation and data from the students was blinded and deidentified from all members of the residency program. Faculty and residents that participated in teaching components of the rotation were sent a survey at the end of the month assessing their ability to evaluate students and barriers of the virtual format.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;8/9 medical students completed pre and post rotation surveys, and 14 educators (8 residents and 6 faculty) completed post rotation surveys. In the pre-rotation survey,&nbsp; 8/8 students expressed that they felt they would not be able to adequately portray themselves or it would be greatly limited by the virtual format. 6/8 students expressed that being able to showcase themselves was not at all a barrier on the post rotation survey, while 2/8 found it to be a moderate barrier. Students rated live patient care activities such as patient rounds and virtual ORs as the most limited in these domains. 6/8 students stated that medical student skills sessions were extremely effective in developing clinical and physical surgical skills, and the remaining 2/8 stated these sessions were very effective. 7/14 educators participated in 6 or more educational activities. 7/14 of the educators felt that there were little to no barriers in being able to evaluate learners.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Based on feedback from both students and educators, the virtual rotation was successful in accomplishing some of the goals that both a residency program has in selection and an applicant has in demonstrating performance. Specifically, every student felt they were able to adequately get a sense of what residency training would be like at the program. This provides useful information to help structure further virtual educational and resident recruitment opportunities for surgical programs.&nbsp;

The mesothelium is the surface layer that regulates the healing of all visceral organs, but the bowel serosa has particular clinical importance.&nbsp; Impaired serosal healing can lead to enteric leaks, fistulas and bowel adhesions. Despite the potential clinical utility of an effective serosal sealant, there is no widely used and FDA-approved bowel sealant. Recently, a plant-derived bioadhesive polymer called pectin was shown to demonstrate remarkable structural similarities to the endogenous mesothelial glycocalyx.&nbsp; Here, we investigated the sealant properties of this naturally-occurring bioadhesive on the bowel serosa.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
To evaluate pectin adhesivity to the bowel serosa, the tensile strength and shear resistance of pectin film adhesion to human and porcine bowel serosa was measured with millinewton (mN) force sensitivity using a computer-controlled materials analyzer (TA.XTplus, Stable Micro Systems, UK) . A custom fixture was developed to approximate the tensile and shear forces observed clinically. The work of adhesion, reflecting the area under the force-distance curve, was quantitatively assessed. The branched-chain pectin was compared to linear-chain nanocellulose fibers (NCF), and pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA). To evaluate sealant performance under extreme luminal pressure, standardized linear defects were created in segments of porcine bowel sealed using commercially available sealant products.&nbsp; The bowel segments were subsequently pressurized to detect sealant leaks.&nbsp; Biologic replicates were performed (N=3 each data point) and expressed as mean + 1 standard deviation. Significance assessed by Student&rsquo;s t-test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The modal tensile strength (3658+251 mN) and shear resistance (5997+762 mN) of pectin adhesion to the bowel serosa was significantly greater than that of NCF (1477+512 mN, 1036+641 mN) or PSA (986+439 mN, 298+362 mN), respectively (p&lt;0.01).&nbsp; The work of adhesion, reflecting an integrated assessment of tensile strength and shear resistance, was also significantly greater than the NCF and PSA controls (p&lt;0.01 asterisk; Figure 1A and 1B). The luminal pressure assay demonstrated that pectin effectively sealed the bowel serosa at luminal pressures that exceeded 60 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (Figure 1C).&nbsp; With luminal pressures sustained for more than 10 minutes, pectin was the only sealant to maintain luminal pressures greater than 60 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (p&lt;.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In these studies, the bioadhesive performance of the pectin sealant easily exceeded the surface forces and luminal pressure encountered in clinical applications. &nbsp;We conclude that pectin is a promising new class of high-performance bioadhesives with potential application in the treatment of bowel injuries.&nbsp;

Dermal injury results in fibroblast-mediated scar formation potentiated by mechanical tension. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSCs)-derived exosomes are new frontiers in regenerative wound healing. It is unknown how 1) mechanical tension regulates MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-exo), and 2) how tension-induced MSC exosomes regulate a fibrotic phenotype end-point of the wound repair process. These may underlie intrinsic&nbsp;fibroblast heterogeneity and why different people scar differently. We hypothesize that tension regulates MSC-exo production and cargo and influences wound healing via paracrine signaling effects on dermal fibroblasts.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Human MSCs were cultured on silicone membranes &plusmn;2.5%, 5% and 10% strain for 24h and analyzed for phenotypic changes (morphology;alpha-SMA; exosome biogenesis &ndash; Rab27a,b, RAB35 and SMPD; fibrosis-superarray). Exosomes were isolated and their size (zetasizer), protein level (BCA-assay), surface markers (CD63, HSP70, CD9), and cargo (Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)) were analyzed. 6mm excisional full thickness wounds in SCID mice were treated with MSCs-exo&plusmn;tension to determine their impact on wound healing phenotype. Dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with differences in baseline scar-forming propensities (high/low scarrers) were treated with MSCs-exo&plusmn;tension and changes in their functional (scratch assay) and fibrotic phenotype (fibrosis super-array) were analyzed. p-values by ANOVA; (n=3/group)

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Increase in tension correlated with the loss of characteristic MSC spindle-like morphology and an increase in alpha-SMA and fibrotic gene expression(&gt;2-fold) at 10% strain, whereas gene expression of RAB27a, b, SMPD was downregulated, with an increase in MSC-exo size and protein cargo (p&lt;0.05). NGS of the MSC-exo revealed that miRNAs and lincRNAs were reduced under tension. KEGG gene pathway analysis of miRNAs showed enrichment for intracellular/extracellular wound healing processes.&nbsp;The top miRs (has-miR-625-5p, has-let-7b-3p, has-miR-889-3p), corresponded to Hippo (growth/homeostasis), Ras, PI3K(proliferation) and AMPK (energy-sensing) signaling. Tension-induced MSC-exo decreased expression of YAP1, GSK3B and PPP2R1A genes (p&lt;0.05) implicated in these pathways in dermal fibroblasts, validating our KEGG findings. While control MSC-exo induced regenerative healing, tension-MSC-exo treatment produced a characteristic scar phenotype in mouse wounds. Fibrotic phenotype and migration of human dermal fibroblasts of &lsquo;low&rsquo; and &lsquo;high&rsquo; scarring phenotypes were differentially regulated when treated with MSC-exo, with &lsquo;high scarrer&rsquo; fibroblasts responding more to tension induced MSC-exo.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Mechanical tension induces a fibrogenic&nbsp;phenotype in MSCs. Understanding how bioactive MSC-exo cargo influences fibroblast behavior will contribute to the development of exosome-based precision medicine therapies to improve wound healing and fibrosis.

Shin<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Department Of Surgery,Houston, TX, USA <sup>2</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Molecular Virology And Microbiology,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Lack of effective treatment against multidrug-resistant microorganisms has caused wound infections to remain one of the biggest threats to patients, leading to prolonged hospitalization, increased morbidity and slow rehabilitation. For this reason, nitric oxide (NO) has been explored as an alternative antimicrobial agent, since it employs multiple antimicrobial mechanisms simultaneously to reduce the likelihood of developing antimicrobial resistance. Although advantages of NO against infection are well reported, its intrinsic nature (as a highly reactive gas) limits suitable delivery vehicles, thereby hindering its use as a therapeutic agent. However, diazeniumdiolate (NONOate), a small molecule NO donor, represents a new strategy for delivery of NO. Each NONOate molecule contains a diolate group, which can release two molecules of NO upon contact with moisture. NONOates can be incorporated into biocompatible polymers to allow delivery of NO in an efficient and controlled fashion, thus overcoming challenges in NO delivery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
NO releasing polymer matrix (NOmatrix) was prepared via 3D-bioprinting technology. Three different NONOates, PROLI-, DPTA-, and DETA-NONOates, were used in this study. Biopolymer solutions of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and ethylcellulose (EC) were prepared and mixed with a solution containing one of three NONOates. The resulting solutions were then bioprinted as NOmatrices. In-vitro NO release was evaluated through 48-hour release studies. Samples were collected at predetermined time points and evaluated using nitrite colorimetric assay. Antimicrobial effect of NOmatrices was evaluated in bacterial cultures of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and toxicity was evaluated in human fibroblast cells.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
PVP-NOmatrices showed sustained release of NO over 48 hours, whereas EC-NOmatrices exhibited burst release, with NO production only occurring within the first two hours. Nevertheless, all NOmatrices inhibited the growth of MRSA and P. aeruginosa in culture, however, P. aeruginosa showed greater susceptibility to treatment with NOmatrices in comparison to MRSA. PVP-NOmatrix was more efficient in preventing the growth of P. aeruginosa than EC-NOmatrix. Specifically, DPTA/PVP and DETA/PVP-NO matrix were most effective, exhibiting 90% inhibition. For MRSA, PROLI/EC-NOmatrix showed the greatest inhibition (~50%) out of all NOmatrices. Overall NOmatrices&nbsp;showed minimal to no toxicity in human fibroblast cells.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We demonstrated the development of NO-releasing biopolymers that can be applied as an antimicrobial bandage. The use of polymers allowed for efficient/easy delivery of NO and extended NO release up to 48 hours from NOmatrix to inhibit the growth of MRSA and P. aeruginosa.

Postnatal dermal wounds heal with scar formation, which can result in severe functional and psychosocial morbidity. We recently reported a spatial/temporal influx of lymphocytes in murine skin wounds where the recruitment of the CD4<sup>+</sup> subset correlated with the proliferative and remodeling phases of wound healing. Furthermore, in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice known to heal skin wounds with increased fibrosis, adoptive transfer of CD4<sup>+</sup> total lymphocytes reduced scarring in an IL-10-dependent manner. However, the contributions of distinctive CD4<sup>+</sup> subsets is unknown. We hypothesize that IL-10 producing CD4<sup>+</sup> subsets such as Tr1, Th2, and Treg differentially regulate postnatal dermal scarring via IL-10-dependent signaling.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
In vitro: CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated from C57BL/6J(WT) mice spleens and cultured with mouse T-Activator CD3/CD28 Dynabeads in conditioned media to induce polarization into subsets: Tr1 (IL-2), Th0 (IL-2), Th1 (IL-2/IL-12/Anti-IL-4), and Th2 (IL-2/IL-4/Anti-IFNg). T cell polarization was confirmed using qPCR to verify cytokine profile and supernatant from cell culture was analyzed for IL-10 expression using ELISA. In vivo: 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells of CD4<sup>+</sup> subsets were adoptively transferred into B6.CB17-Prkdc<sup>scid</sup>/SzJ(SCID) mice lacking functional lymphocytes that received two full-thickness (6mm) stented excisional dorsal wounds. Stents were maintained until day 7 to prevent contraction, wounds were harvested at day 7 and 28 and analyzed using H&amp;E, Trichrome, a-SMA, and anti-CD31 staining.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
qPCR demonstrated expected cytokine profiles from polarized T-cell subsets, with elevated production of IL-10 from Th2 (3,484 pg/ml) and Tr1 subsets (918 pg/ml) confirmed by ELISA. In comparison to SCID control wounds which were about 50% re-epithelialized at day 7, wounds of mice treated with Tr1 cells were completely epithelialized at 7 days, while wounds of mice treated with Th0, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and combined CD4<sup>+</sup>/Tr1 cells were all ~15% re-epithelialized. At day 28, Tr1-treated wounds had reduced fibrosis with lowest amount of collagen content compared to Th0, CD4<sup>+</sup>, or CD4<sup>+</sup>/Tr1 cells (97.8pixels/HPF vs 111.6, 120.2, and 116.9). However, a-SMA percentage at day 7 was greatest in wounds of mice treated with Tr1 cells compared to Th0, CD4<sup>+</sup>, or CD4<sup>+</sup>/Tr1 cells (51%cells/HPF vs 41%, 31%, and 44%). Quantification of microvascular density at day 30 showed increased vessel density in wounds treated with combined CD4<sup>+</sup>/Tr1 cells followed by CD4<sup>+</sup> and Tr1 cohorts (17.3vessels/HPF vs 12.0 and 5.5).

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our study shows that IL-10 producing Tr1 cells contribute to expedited wound closure and reduced dermal scarring. Our data also suggest Tr1 cells interact with CD4<sup>+</sup> cells to improve wound neovascularization. With future studies involving the interaction of innate and adaptive immune systems, we can uncover new paradigms of IL-10-producing lymphocyte subsets in wound physiology and their therapeutic value to ameliorate dermal scarring.

Lurie Children's Hospital,Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury is an inflammatory process resulting in restenosis and failure of bypass surgery, angioplasty, and stenting. We previously showed that germ-free (GF) mice have diminished susceptibility to neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury, which is reversed by fecal transplantation (FT), suggesting that arterial remodeling is influenced by microbiota. However, GF mice have broadly impaired immune development, which could impact causative pathways. We hypothesized that gut microbiota transfer to adult antibiotic-treated conventional mice would result in recipient microbiota resembling the donors and would confer the injury-induced arterial remodeling of the fecal donor.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Adult C57BL/6 mice were treated with cefoperazone (cefo) for 3 weeks followed by FT using donors from rat strains which are known to be susceptible (Sprague-Dawley; SD) or resistant (Lewis; LE) to neointimal hyperplasia. Control cohorts either received cefo alone or had neither cefo nor FT.&nbsp;&nbsp;All mice underwent left femoral artery wire injury (WI) 2 weeks after FT. Neointimal hyperplasia was assessed by morphometric analysis of arterial sections 2 weeks after injury. The gut microbiota were&nbsp;assessed using 16S rRNA qPCR and sequencing of stool samples collected at various time points.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Two weeks after WI, neointimal hyperplasia was not different between control and cefoperazone-treated cohorts. In contrast to our hypothesis, LE recipients had significantly more neointimal hyperplasia compared to both controls and SD recipient (Figure). There were no histologic differences in the uninjured right FA among all groups. In cefo-treated cohorts, bacterial load was significantly depleted compared to the non-cefo control cohort following cefo treatment, but was restored to near baseline levels by the time of arterial injury. However, microbial taxonomic profiling revealed broad differences between the 4 groups over time, thus suggesting a significant change in the recipient microbiomes after FT. LE recipient mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) had significantly more reactive changes compared to SD and control MLN and may signal modulation of the intestinal inflammatory response by LE microbiota that altered peripheral arterial remodeling.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

We demonstrate that FT&nbsp;subsequent to antibiotic&nbsp;treatment in adult conventionally-raised mice impacts neointimal hyperplasia susceptibility after arterial injury, providing a model that avoids the impaired immunologic responses observed with GF mice. Ongoing studies aim to identify causal microbiota constituents driven by cefoperazone and FT and their impact on inflammatory pathways that correlate with neointimal hyperplasia susceptibility.

Micronization of adipose has gained popularity as smaller graft are used to superficial or attenuated skin. Total mechanical dissociation of adipose allows us to non-enzymatically generate a stem cell rich, non-structural emulsion useful for intra-dermal injection. Several techniques exist to generate non-structural fat; however, it is unknown how current methodologies compare in operative efficiency. Here we examine three of the most common techniques currently in practice and assess the relative efficacy of each paradigm.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Lipoaspirate from elective body contouring procedures was obtained as discarded tissue under IRB exemption. Tissue was either maintained as a lipoaspirate control or mechanically dissociated by one of the following: A) Inter-syringe Dissociation&nbsp; (1.0 mm aperture); B) Serial Meshing (coarse, moderate, fine steel mesh), C) Percussive Dissociation (bead milling) prior to a final filtration step through a mesh nanotransfer chamber to achieve a consistent non-structural adipose product.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Independent of volume, a per-pass loss of ~0.64+/-0.11 g of lipoaspirate occurred secondary to dead space when utilizing nanotransfer kit filtration. With serial meshing this loss was cumulative across each filtration step (2.26+/-0.15 g) with no significant differences between other techniques. Dead space loss was correctable by addition of subsequent positive-pressure washing. Stromal entrapment during filtration was significantly lower after inter-syringe dissociation vs. other techniques (A: 0.13+/-0.01 g; B: 0.36+/-0.02 g; C: 0.32+/-0.35 g; p&lt;0.05) for 5 cc of starting lipoaspirate. Stromal capture was volume dependent (5 cc: 0.13+/-0.01 g; 20 cc: 0.30+/-0.01). Fractional oil release was utilized as a proxy for lysis of lipid-laden mature adipocytes. Oil release increased significantly with inter-syringe and percussive dissociation but serial meshing (Control: 0.18+/-0.02%; A:0.20+/-0.03%; B: 0.34+/-0.04%; C: 0.39+/-0.02%). Samples of non-structural fat from each group were digested in collagenase to assess cellular yield and viability. All groups were normalized to inter-syringe dissociation. We found a significant decrease in cell count with percussive dissociation vs. both other techniques (A:1.0+/-0.12 cells; B:1.19+/-0.17 cells; C: 0.61+/-0.13 cells).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Given the increasing popularity of non-structural fat products in the operative sphere for both reconstructive and aesthetic procedures a critical review of current processing techniques is necessary to ensure operative efficiency and therapeutic efficacy moving forward. Our data suggests that while effective fractionation may be generated by each of the available techniques to generate non-structural fat there are significant difference in per volume efficiency, yield, and stromal purification between each. This is critical data to the surgeon who must choose which of these characteristics is most desired for their given clinical need.

Wade<sup>1</sup>, L. S. Kao<sup>1</sup>, G. E. Hatton<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Health Science Center At Houston,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Occult hypoperfusion (OH), or hypoperfusion in the setting of normal vital signs, has increasingly been recognized to result in similar or worse outcomes as shock after trauma. Shock has been demonstrated to induce endothelial dysfunction, evidenced by elevated soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) and syndecan-1 (Syn-1). However, it is unknown if OH is also associated with endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that sTM and Syn-1 would be elevated in patients with OH, similar to patients with shock, when compared to patients with normal perfusion.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single-center study of patients requiring highest-level trauma activation (2012-2016) was performed. Trauma bay arrival plasma Syn-1 and sTM were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Shock was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;90mmHg or heart rate (HR) &ge;120 bpm. OH was defined as SBP &ge;90, HR&lt;120, and base excess (BE) &le;-3. Normal perfusion was assigned to all others. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed, adjusted for known or suspected confounders: injury severity score, age, and sex.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 520 patients, 35% presented with OH and 26% with shock. The median age was 40 (IQR 27-55) while male sex (77%) and blunt mechanism of injury (72%) were predominant in all groups. Median transfusion requirements were highest in those with shock (4 units, IQR 1-17), followed by OH (2, IQR 0-9), and finally by normal perfusion (1, IQR 0-6). Patients with normal perfusion had the lowest Syn-1 and sTM, while patients with OH and shock had similarly elevated levels. (Figure) Although the associations were imprecise on multivariable analysis, OH was associated with increased sTM by 0.9ng/mL (95% CI 0.3-1.5, p=0.005) and Syn-1 by 9.5ng/mL (-6.5-25.5, p=0.25). Shock was associated with increased sTM by 0.5ng/mL (95% CI -0.1-1.2, p=0.13) and increased Syn-1 by 16.8ng/mL (-0.7-34.3, p=0.06).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Occult hypoperfusion after trauma, like shock, is associated with elevated serum sTM and Syn-1, indicating endothelial dysfunction. Treatments aiming to stabilize the endothelium, such as plasma products, may be beneficial for injured patients with evidence of hypoperfusion, regardless of vital signs.

Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS-IH) is a pediatric disease caused by a G&rarr;&nbsp;A mutation in the IDUA gene which results in undetectable IDUA enzyme and the buildup of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Disease involves multiple organs but is particularly severe in the heart. GAG deposition in the aortic wall, mitral and aortic valves, and cardiac muscle&nbsp;leads to root dilation, valvular insufficiency, and cardiomyopathy. Children develop these pathologies early in life, require numerous surgical interventions,&nbsp;and ultimately die by age 10. Current treatments include enzyme replacement therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation both of which have significant morbidity and cost. Investigative postnatal gene therapies are limited by inefficient cardiac correction. In contrast, fetal gene correction offers the potential to correct the mutation before the onset of irreversible pathology.

Using adeno associated vectors, we delivered an adenine base editor and guide RNA targeting the murine MPS-IH mutation in embryonic day 15.5 fetuses via the vitelline vein, a hepatic tributary. Echocardiography (TTE) was assessed at 4 and 6 months. At 6 months, cardiac tissue was assayed for enzyme function and GAG levels. Myocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts were isolated using flow cytometry to evaluate gene editing. Histologic specimens were assessed with Alcian blue and Masson&rsquo;s trichrome stains to evaluate structural morphology. Controls included age and sex-matched MPS-IH disease mice and healthy C57/B6 mice.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Next generation sequencing at 6 months demonstrated efficient gene editing in cardiac myocytes (~12.6%), endothelial cells (~3.0%), and fibroblasts (~2.3%). At 4 and 6 months, TTE in treated mice demonstrated systolic and diastolic function that was normalized. LV systolic and diastolic diameters were reduced, and ejection fraction and fractional shortening were increased in treated mice. Disease mice with aortic diameters&gt;3.5cm at 4 months had 100% mortality by 6 months. In contrast no treated mice developed aortic dilation, and none died during the study. At 6 months, robust enzymatic activity was detected in the heart with decreased GAGs compared to disease controls. Histology in treated mice revealed reduced GAGs in the left ventricle and interventricular septum, reduced valvular thickening, and improved aortic cellular architecture.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Fetal correction of the G&rarr;&nbsp;A mutation in the MPS-IH mouse leads to normalization of cardiac function and is associated with improved survival. We found efficient and precise correction in the heart in multiple cell types. Due to early onset of cardiac pathology associated with significant mortality, in utero treatment of MPS-IH has significant relevance for clinical translation. Although this proof-of-concept intervention is promising, further work to characterize the safety of fetal gene therapies will be essential.

Puder<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Boston Children's Hospital,Boston, MA, USA","Background:&nbsp;Pulmonary hypoplasia (PH), characterized by immature lung development, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). We previously demonstrated that FG-4592, a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, accelerates pulmonary growth and development in a compensatory lung growth (CLG) model following pneumonectomy. This accelerated growth is potentially through downregulation of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Here, we further investigate the role of PEDF in pulmonary growth and development in wild type (WT) and PEDF-deficient mice.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Eight-week old PEDF-deficient mice underwent left pneumonectomy. On post-operative days (POD) 0, 2, and 4, lung volume measurements and morphometrics were performed to study the natural history of CLG in PEDF-deficient mice. In a separate study, eight-week old PEDF-deficient and WT mice underwent left pneumonectomy. On POD 4, lung volume measurements and morphometrics were performed. In another study, eight-week old PEDF-deficient and WT mice underwent left pneumonectomy followed by either twice daily oral gavage of FG-4592 at 40 mg/kg or a volume equivalent normal saline control. On POD 2, lung volume measurements and morphometrics were performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;PEDF-deficient mice complete CLG by POD 4 demonstrated by lung volume, alveolar volume, and septal surface area similar to non-operative controls. Historically, WT mice require eight days for completed CLG. PEDF-deficient mice had significantly increased lung volume, alveolar volume, and septal surface area on POD 4 compared to WT controls following pneumonectomy. Compared to untreated WT controls, both FG-4592 treated and untreated PEDF-deficient mice exhibited increased lung volume, alveolar volume, and septal surface area similar to FG-4592 treated WT mice on POD 2.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;PEDF downregulation significantly accelerates pulmonary growth and development. This is demonstrated by completed CLG in PEDF-deficient mice on POD 4 in comparison to POD 8 in WT. Additionally, PEDF-deficient mice, compared to WT mice had significantly accelerated CLG following pneumonectomy. Finally, both FG-4592 untreated and treated PEDF-deficient mice demonstrated accelerated CLG following pneumonectomy similar to WT mice treated with FG-4592. Taken together, these results further confirm our hypothesis that FG-4592 accelerates CLG through PEDF downregulation. FG-4592 is currently in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of anemia with minimal side effects. Therefore, studies in the treatment of PH and diseases of pulmonary development such as CDH could proceed expeditiously.

Risk factors for the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS include pneumonia, major abdominal surgery, and post-operative sepsis. ARDS is characterized by an unyielding pro-inflammatory state leading to pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and a need for mechanical ventilation. Current treatment is limited to supportive care. CNP-miR146a is the conjugation of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP), a free radical scavenger, to the anti-inflammatory microRNA(miR)-146a. miR146a is an inhibitor of IRAK1 and TRAF6, which are early promoters of the NF&kappa;B inflammatory pathway that increases IL-6 and IL-8 levels. We hypothesized that treatment with intratracheal (IT) CNP-miR146a would result in early reductions of pro-inflammatory gene signaling and stabilization of the alveolocapillary barrier with decreased protein leak in a well-established lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&nbsp;model of ALI.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Age-matched, female C57BL/6 mice (n = 12) were given 50&mu;g IT LPS to induce lung injury or saline as a control. Four hours after injury, LPS-injured mice were given 1ng of IT CNP-miR146a (LPS + CNP-miR146a, n = 4). Remaining LPS-injured mice and control mice were given an equivalent volume of saline (LPS + Sal, n = 4; Sal + Sal, n = 4). Eight hours after injury, a tracheostomy was performed through which 0.8mL phosphate-buffered saline was twice instilled for collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Fluid was analyzed using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit for colorimetric quantification of protein concentration. Following BAL, whole lungs were harvested and processed for total RNA extraction. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis was performed to evaluate expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes NF&kappa;B, IRAK1, and TRAF6.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;There was an increase in NF&kappa;B and IRAK1 gene expression in LPS-injured lungs (p = 0.0039 and p = 0.0097, respectively), with similar trends in TRAF6. NF&kappa;B and IRAK1 gene expression were&nbsp;suppressed with IT CNP-miR146a four hours after injury (p = 0.0385 and p = 0.0162). LPS-injury increased BAL protein concentration compared to controls (p = 0.0282). CNP-miR146a treatment reduced BAL protein levels to 417.0 &mu;g/mL compared to 643.1 &mu;g/mL in LPS-injured mice (p = 0.0282).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;IT administration of CNP-miR146a is able to rescue the lung from early pro-inflammatory gene signaling following injury, correlating to an early reduction in bronchoalveolar protein leak. This represents a potential therapeutic for the rescue of ALI in inflammatory conditions, such as post-operative sepsis.

PP2A has been found to be suppressed&nbsp;in multiple cancers, thus losing its tumor suppressor function. Our lab has previously shown that FTY720, a PP2A activator, decreased the malignant phenotype in neuroblastoma. Amplification of the MYCN oncogene is the most important negative prognostic indicator in neuroblastoma. Beta-catenin is an upstream regulator of MYCN and has been shown to increase neuroblastoma cell proliferation. We wished to investigate the effects of two novel PP2A activators, ATUX-792 (792) and DBK-1154 (1154), on neuroblastoma growth and motility in vitro and the relation between PP2A activation, MYCN, and beta-catenin.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Four neuroblastoma cell lines were used, SK-N-AS (AS) and SH-EP (MYCN non-amplified)&nbsp;and SK-N-BE(2) (BE) and WAC(2) (MYCN amplified). PP2A activation was measured with a phosphatase activation kit following treatment of AS cells with 792 or 1154 for 24 hours. Neuroblastoma cells were treated with increasing doses of 792 or 1154 (0, 5, 10, 15 &mu;M) for 24 hours. Cell viability and proliferation were examined using alamarBlue&reg;&nbsp;and CellTiter96&reg;&nbsp;assays, respectively. To evaluate motility, cells were treated with 792 or 1154 (10 - 15&mu;M). Migration was measured using a cell monolayer wounding assay at 36 hours. Invasion was examined using modified Boyden chambers where treated cells were allowed to invade for 24 hours. Immunoblotting was used to detect the effects of PP2A activation on the expression of MYCN and beta-catenin.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Treatment with 792 and 1154 resulted in significant PP2A activation in AS cells (118% &plusmn; 6 % and 139% &plusmn; 18 % vs untreated, respectively, p&lt;0.05). Cell survival (fig A, B) and proliferation (fig C, D) were significantly decreased following treatment with 792 or 1154. Treatment with 792 or 1154 also significantly decreased ability of cells to migrate across a scratch wound (fig E) and invade through a Matrigel layer (fig F). Immunoblotting revealed a decrease in MYCN and beta-catenin protein expression with increasing concentrations of 792 and 1154.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;PP2A activation with 792 and 1154 decreased survival, proliferation, and motility of neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, treatment with both drugs resulted in decreased expression of the oncogenic proteins MYCN and beta-catenin. These findings indicate a potential therapeutic role for these novel PP2A activators in neuroblastoma.

We have determined that NEC-associated brain injury in humans and mice requires activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the hypothalamic microglia, which causes inflammation and white matter injury. Breast milk  which is rich in the human milk oligosaccharides 2'-FL and 6'-SL - prevents NEC and improves long-term cognition through mechanisms that remain unknown. We now hypothesize that these human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as anti-inflammatory molecules to prevent NEC-associated brain injury by inhibiting TLR4.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: NEC was induced in 7-day-old C57BL/6 mouse pups through four days of gavage-fed formula mixed with NEC bacteria, and periods of brief hypoxia. The brains were examined histologically and by qRT-PCR after oral administration of the key HMOs: 2-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and 6-siallylactose (6'-SL) and compared to breastfed (BF) and NEC formula-fed (FF) mice. To evaluate the mechanisms involved, we developed a brain organoid culture system from embryonic brains (e14.5-16.5) in the presence of the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide  HMOs.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Administration of 2'-FL and 6'-SL significantly reduced brain inflammation in a dose-dependent manner, as revealed by reduced TNF-a expression (BF:0.40.05,FF:10.1,FF+2-FL:0.50.1,FF+6-SL:0.50.05, p<0.001) and decreased neuronal apoptosis by PUMA expression (BF:443,FF:695,FF+2-FL:464,FF+6-SL:444, p<0.001) in the periventricular regions. Strikingly, 2'-FL and 6'-SL reduced TLR4 signaling in cultured brain organoids, as manifest by the significant reduction of ROS generation by dihydroethidium staining, reduced expression of IL-6 (LPS:20025,LPS+2-FL+6-SL:102, p<0.001) and TNF-a (LPS:1,000500,LPS+2-FL+6-SL:20020, p<0.001), and reduced apoptosis by TUNEL staining, consistent with the cerebral protection seen in vivo.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:These findings reveal a novel mechanism to explain the neuroprotective effects of breast milk in NEC, by revealing an anti-inflammatory role for the HMOs 2'-FL and 6'-SL, suggesting that HMO supplementation can offer neuroprotective strategies for patients with NEC.

Our lab previously established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from a high-grade neuroendocrine-like tumor in a pediatric patient to evaluate targeted therapeutics. Additionally, the patient had extensive abdominal tumor metastasis at presentation. Identifying drugs capable of impeding metastatic growth is crucial for improved patient survival. Next-Generation Sequencing identified an ALK mutation and crizotinib, an ALK inhibitor, has been effective in other ALK-mutated pediatric malignancies. We hypothesized that we could create a metastatic model with this PDX and that crizotinib would affect the metastatic phenotype of this PDX both in vitro and in vivo.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Cells (2 x 10<sup>6</sup>) from a dissociated PDX flank tumor were injected into the peritoneal cavity of athymic nude mice. Weekly abdominal exams were performed to detect metastasis. Histology was performed on harvested metastatic tumors. Dissociated metastatic tumor cells were treated with increasing doses of crizotinib. Viability was measured with alamarBlue&reg; and immunoblotting examined the effects of crizotinib on downstream cell signaling cascades. Mice bearing intraabdominal metastasis were treated with crizotinib (75 mg/kg/day per os, n = 5) or vehicle (n = 4) for 31 days. Metastatic tumor burden was determined by tumor weight at the time of euthanasia.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We successfully established a metastatic PDX model with this neuroendocrine-like PDX. Histology revealed that the established abdominal metastasis recapitulated the original patient tumor and original flank PDX (Figure 1a-b). The metastasis stained chromogranin positive, indicating neuroendocrine properties (Figure 1c). Crizotinib treatment in vitro significantly decreased viability of the metastatic PDX cells with an LD<sub>50</sub> of 2.2 &micro;M. Immunoblotting revealed a decrease in phosphorylation of STAT3 with increasing doses of Crizotinib (Figure 1d). Following peritoneal injection of PDX cells, mice treated with Crizotinib had significantly less metastatic burden than those treated with vehicle (63 mg &plusmn; 49 mg vs. 251 mg &plusmn; 98 mg, Crizotinib vs. vehicle, p = 0.05, Figure 1e).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;We established a metastatic PDX model of a neuroendocrine-like tumor that maintained a similar profile to that of the patient&rsquo;s original tumor. Additionally, we have shown that crizotinib successfully decreased metastatic tumor cell viability in vitro and metastatic tumor growth in vivo. Immunoblotting suggests decreased activity of STAT3 may be the mechanism responsible.

Puder<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Boston Children's Hospital,Department Of Surgery And Vascular Biology Program,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) suffer from pulmonary hypoplasia (PH) and may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and systemic anticoagulation. Expeditious pulmonary growth on ECMO is required to reduce mortality, which approaches 50%. In addition to the critically ill CDH patients requiring ECMO and therapeutic anticoagulation, many patients receive subtherapeutic anticoagulation to maintain patency of venous catheters and prevent venous thrombosis. Previously, our lab demonstrated that therapeutic dose heparin impairs compensatory lung growth (CLG) following pneumonectomy in a murine model. We now investigate the effects of therapeutic and subtherapeutic dose heparin on lung endothelial cell proliferation and pulmonary functional outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Lung endothelial cells were treated with increasing doses of heparin and cell proliferation was assessed. C57BL/6 mice were treated with saline control, subtherapeutic (low-dose, 250U/kg), or therapeutic (high-dose, 500U/kg) heparin via intraperitoneal injection every 12 hours for three doses. Plasma anti-factor Xa levels were measured one hour after the last dose. A separate cohort of mice underwent baseline treadmill exercise tolerance testing (TETT) followed by pneumonectomy and treatment with saline or low- or high-dose heparin for eight days. TETT was repeated on post-operative day eight.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Heparin induced a dose-dependent decrease in lung endothelial cell proliferation (A). High-dose heparin significantly increased plasma anti-factor Xa to therapeutic levels while low-dose heparin and saline did not (B). On post-operative day eight after pneumonectomy, mice treated with low- (C), and high- (D) dose heparin ran for significantly less time and shorter distance compared to saline control.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Heparin inhibits lung endothelial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and decreases post-pneumonectomy exercise tolerance at therapeutic and subtherapeutic doses. These data suggest that therapeutic and subtherapeutic heparin may worsen outcomes for neonates with CDH and other pulmonary hypoplastic diseases through inhibiting pulmonary endothelial proliferation and impairing pulmonary function. Accordingly, the choice of drug, dose, and duration of therapy for neonates with hypoplastic lung disease requiring anticoagulation should be reconsidered.

Deciding between IC and up-front surgery involves an evaluation of tumor resectability via assessment of pre-operative CT imaging findings and is largely dependent on surgical experience and expertise. Incomplete resection has been linked to a larger tumor size and higher-risk World Health Organization (WHO) B1-B3 subtypes. We aimed to identify objective criteria which may be used to determine the need for IC by testing the hypothesis that IC in 8 cm or larger, WHO B1-B3 subtype thymoma improves survival and/or resectability.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We used the National Cancer Database to identify a retrospective cohort of patients undergoing surgical resection for &ge;8cm, B1-B3 thymoma, with or without IC. Those with Masaoka-Koga stage IVb disease were excluded. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of IC. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox-regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;2876 patients met the inclusion criteria, out of which 450 (15.6%) patients had &ge;8cm, B1-B3 thymoma. IC was administered in 265 (9.2%) patients and was more likely to be used in younger individuals, males, advanced disease stage, &ge;8cm, B1-B3 thymoma and academic centers, all p&lt;0.05. In a propensity matched analysis of 160 patients with &ge;8cm, B1-B3 thymoma, IC did not significantly increase median survival time compared to surgery alone (p=0.64) and was not a significant prognosticator of survival (HR: 1.21, 95% CI 0.62-2.34, p=0.57). A younger age at diagnosis was the only predictor of improved OS in this cohort (p=0.04). IC significantly increased the median time to definitive surgery (135 days vs. 13 days, p&lt;0.01) and did not increase the likelihood of an R0 resection (p=0.22).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;IC is likely to be administered in 8 cm or larger, B1-B3 thymoma although it may not improve survival time or resectability in this population. Tumor size and WHO histology may not adequately determine the need for IC in patients with thymoma.

Benharash<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - Los Angeles,Division Of Cardiac Surgery,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Surgical re-exploration following lung resection remains poorly characterized, though institutional series have reported an association between postoperative bleeding and mortality. The present study sought to examine the impact of institutional lung resection volume on incidence of and short-term outcomes following surgical re-exploration.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All adults undergoing elective lobectomy or pneumonectomy were identified using the 2007-2017 National Inpatient Sample (NIS). Diagnoses and procedures were tabulated using International Classification of Diseases 9/10 codes. Thoracoscopic and robotic-assisted approaches were categorized as minimal access. Hospitals were divided into low- (LVH), medium- (MVH) and high-volume (HVH) tertiles based on institutional lung resection caseload. Trends were examined using nonparametric tests and Chi-square or Wald&rsquo;s tests were used to compare categorical or continuous variables, respectively. Multivariable regression was used to identify associations between patient and hospital factors on re-exploration and mortality, duration of hospitalization (LOS) and costs.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 324,174 patients who met study criteria, 3,547 (1.09%) required re-exploration, which declined in frequency over time (p&lt;0.001). Relative to others, the re-exploration group had a greater proportion of open resections (82.3% vs 60.9%, p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, mortality (8.51% vs 1.79%), LOS (13.5 days vs 7.0 days), and costs ($29,634 vs $26,495) were all higher in the re-exploration cohort compared to those not having re-operation (p&lt;0.001). After adjustment (C-statistic: 0.74), several factors were associated with increased likelihood of re-exploration including infectious or inflammatory etiologies relative to malignancy (AOR 3.14, 95% CI 2.65-3.74) and pneumonectomy (AOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.48-2.25). Meanwhile, minimal access was associated with decreased risk of re-exploration compared to open (AOR 0.43, 95% CI 0.35-0.53). Although LOS, costs, and rates of re-exploration were similar across volume tertiles, re-exploration at MVH and HVH was associated with significantly reduced odds of mortality relative to LVH (Figure). Moreover, the indication for resection was not correlated with increased mortality following re-exploration.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Re-exploration after lung resection is uncommon nationally; however, when occurring is associated with significantly increased in-hospital mortality. Following re-exploration, medium and high-volume center status was associated with reduced odds of mortality relative to low volume status. This demonstration in failure-to-rescue at lower volume centers suggests the need for optimization of perioperative factors to decrease incidence of re-exploration.

Rivera<sup>1</sup>, J. M. Long<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill,Chapel Hill, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Consensus guidelines recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation in patients with Stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are determined to be surgical candidates. However, data assessing adherence to this approach are lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and disparities in guideline concordant neoadjuvant therapy in patients with Stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC who underwent surgery.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with clinical stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC who underwent surgical resection between 2010-2016 in the National Cancer Database. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of race, insurance status, rurality, and area income with receipt of neoadjuvant therapy while controlling for other demographics and disease factors.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We identified 8968 patients who underwent surgical resection for stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC between 2010-2016. Of these, 3934 (44%) received guideline concordant neoadjuvant therapy. Factors associated with receiving neoadjuvant therapy were private insurance status (OR 1.47 95% CI 1.04;2.06) and zip-code median income (&gt;$40,227 OR 1.18, &gt;$50,354 1.37, &gt;$63,333 OR 1.58). Of note, in our cohort 1676 (19%) patients underwent surgical resection only. The sole factor associated with undergoing surgery only versus guideline concordant treatment was uninsured insurance status (OR 2.54 95% CI 1.59-4.07).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;In the NCDB, over half of patients undergoing surgery for Stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC did not receive recommended neoadjuvant therapy. This includes a significant number of patients who underwent surgical resection only. Private insurance and higher neighborhood income, proxy measures of higher socioeconomic status, are associated with higher likelihood of neoadjuvant therapy. Targeting patients most sensitive to the financial demands of neoadjuvant therapy, such as those without private insurance or from poorer areas, may result in population improvements in guideline concordance in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.

Teman<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Virginia,Department Of Surgery, Division Of Cardiac Surgery,Charlottesville, VA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Cannulation of the axillary artery is an important approach for cardiopulmonary bypass and transcatheter valve delivery in select cardiac operations. However, little is known about the long-term musculoskeletal consequences of this approach. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative pectoralis muscle atrophy and functional impairment.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Records of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring axillary artery cannulation between 2011-2019 were extracted from an institutional Society of Thoracic Surgeons database. Patients with follow-up CT scans between 1 month and 1 year postoperatively were selected for analysis. Bilateral pectoralis major and minor muscle area was measured at the level of the aortic arch. The cannulated ipsilateral muscle was compared to the contralateral muscle area as control. Area differences were compared utilizing paired analysis. Patients were contacted for a follow-up survey of their functional status. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine association between relative atrophy and variables of interest.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 187 patients were identified as requiring axillary artery cannulation with 58 (31.0%) having follow-up imaging appropriate for study inclusion. The average age was 64.1&plusmn;10.8 years and 62.1% (36/58) were male. Median time between surgery and follow-up CT scan was 126.5 days. The right axillary artery was cannulated for 94.8% (55/58) of patients. The mean muscle area ipsilateral to the cannulation site was significantly smaller for both pectoralis major, 496.0&plusmn;230.6 mm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;vs. 648.6&plusmn;289.9 mm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(p&lt;0.001) and pectoralis minor, 180.6&plusmn;66.1 mm<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>vs. 207.3&plusmn;70.7 mm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(p=0.004). Atrophy of the pectoralis major was evident in 77.6% (45/58) of patients with a median decline of 34.3% (IQR 11.3%-46.3%). Pectoralis minor atrophy was present in 65.5% (38/58) patients with a median decline of 20.9% (IQR 10.6%-41.4%). There was no significant association between the degree of pectoralis atrophy and the urgency of the operation (emergent vs. non-emergent), medical comorbidities, or baseline nutrition status (all p&gt;0.05). Patient surveys revealed no significant correlation between reported functional limitations and radiographically apparent muscle atrophy.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These finding suggest significant radiographic evidence of pectoralis muscle atrophy does occur after axillary artery cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no functional differences were observed in our survey data, surgeons should consider this potential sequela and consider this novel finding when determining an optimal, patient-specific perfusion strategy.

Such patients pose significant challenges for thoracic surgeons with regards to technical aspects of re-operative surgeries as well as suboptimal preoperative lung function tests. In this study, we sought to compare anatomic lung resections (lobectomy and segmentectomy) and wedge resections for small peripheral SPLC using a population-based database.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was queried for all patients with early-stage peripheral SPLC (&le; 2cm, N0, M0) diagnosed between 1998 and 2015. Only patients treated with a prior lobectomy for their first primary were included. American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines were used to classify SPLC. Patients whose records included a malignancy other than lung or had SPLC of small cell histology were excluded. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate cox regression were used to compare overall survival. Figure 1 summarizes our strict selection criteria for this study.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 437 patients met the inclusion criteria with 240 (54.9%) treated with wedge resection and 197 (45.1%) treated with anatomic resection. Thirty-day and ninety-day mortality was significantly higher with anatomic resection (3% vs 0%, p = 0.006 and 6.6% vs 2.1%, p = 0.02 respectively). However, patients who underwent anatomic resection demonstrated better median survival than those treated with wedge resections on Kaplan Meier (88 vs 68 months, p = 0.006) and multivariate cox regression (HR: 0.68, CI: 0.50 &ndash; 0.92 p = 0.01).&nbsp; No survival difference was observed when anatomic resection was compared with wedge resection with at least one lymph node sampled (88 vs 73 months, p = 0.27), [HR: 0.77, CI: 0.52 &ndash; 1.13 p = 0.18].&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Anatomic resections may provide better survival than wedge resections for patients with early-stage peripheral SPLC after prior lobectomy albeit with higher perioperative mortality. Significant improvement in survival is observed with wedge resection for SPLC when lymph node sampling is performed.

Despite this benefit, nearly 20% of patients are not adequately optimized prior to surgery. It is currently unknown how surgeon-level adherence to optimization impacts outcomes. In this context, we evaluated the association between surgeon adherence to optimization practices and surgeon-level postoperative outcomes to motivate quality improvement efforts.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective analysis of Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) data from 2014-2018 was performed to examine rates of surgeon adherence to optimization guidelines when performing elective ventral incisional hernia repair (VIHR). Adherence to preoperative patient optimization guidelines was defined as patients at the time of surgery who were non-tobacco users, with a BMI &gt;18.5 kg/m2 and &lt;40 kg/m2. After adjusting for patient and clinical covariates (age, sex, race, ASA class, functional status, unhealthy alcohol use (&gt;2 drinks/day), hypertension, CHF, COPD, CAD, PVD, bleeding disorder, prior DVT, OSA, surgical approach (open vs MIS), inpatient vs ambulatory, admission source (home vs facility), and year of surgery), surgeons were assigned a risk and reliability adjusted adherence rate which was used to divide surgeons into tertiles (low adherence, moderate adherence, high adherence). Logistic regression was used to describe the association between surgeon adherence and adverse postoperative outcomes.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In this cohort across 70 hospitals in Michigan, there were 21,524 patients who underwent VIHR, cared for by 457 surgeons. After adjusting for comorbidities, there was wide variation in surgeon adherence to preoperative optimization (Figure 1). Surgeons in the lowest tertile of optimization had patients with significantly higher rates of emergency department visits within 30 days (adjusted rate 8.78% vs 7.05% vs 7.03%, p&lt;0.001), serious complications (adjusted rate 2.12% vs 1.56% vs. 1.84%, p=0.041), and any complication (adjusted rate 4.08% vs 3.37% vs 4.04%, p= 0.043), compared to surgeons in the middle and highest tertiles of optimization.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Surgeons&rsquo; clinical outcomes, including rates of emergency department visits and complications, are affected by their proportion of patient optimization with regard to obesity and tobacco use. These results suggest that surgeons can significantly improve their overall postoperative outcomes by addressing patient tobacco use and weight prior to surgery.&nbsp; Quality improvement efforts focused on maximizing surgeon-level adherence may be warranted to help improve patient clinical outcomes.

Weight loss from bariatric surgery may decrease complications of pregnancy, including gestational diabetes, fetal growth disorders, and cesarean delivery. Current consensus guidelines recommend women delay conception by 12-24 months after bariatric surgery to prevent potential adverse outcomes for both the mother (e.g. unrealized weight loss) and infant (e.g. prematurity, low birth weight). Still, little is known about rates or timing of births following bariatric surgery. Thus, the objective of this study was to define the epidemiology of births after bariatric surgery.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Using IBM MarketScan claims data, we performed a retrospective cohort study of all women age 18-52 undergoing bariatric surgery from 2011-2017 with at least 6 months of continuous follow-up after surgery. We calculated the number of births occurring before 21 months, as this is 9 months (the usual length of pregnancy) following the least conservative recommendation for conception post-surgery. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed using birth as the dependent variable. We examined pregnancy rates by procedure type (laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, laparoscopic gastric bypass, and other) using Cox regression analysis, controlling for age, geographic state, and Elixhauser comorbidities.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 71,976 included women, 87% had full 1-year and 56% had full 2-year follow-up. Within the first 2 years after surgery, 2.1 in 100 women (1,511) gave birth. Time to first birth is shown below: 76% of births occurred before 21 months after bariatric surgery. Finally, Cox regression analysis showed no association between procedure type (sleeve gastrectomy vs gastric bypass) and likelihood to give birth (HR: 0.93, 95%CI: 0.83 - 1.03, p=0.17). The age group with the highest likelihood of birth was age 25-29 (HR: 1.43, 95%CI: 1.21 - 1.68, p&lt;.0001, reference group: age 18-24).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This is the first nationally representative cohort study of pregnancy after bariatric surgery in the United States. We found a high level of discordance between current guidelines and pregnancy. Approximately 2 of every 100 women of childbearing age undergoing bariatric surgery give birth within the first two years after surgery, the majority of whom conceive prior to the least conservative recommendation of 12 months. Given that the number of individuals with obesity and undergoing bariatric surgery are growing yearly, more attention to maternal and fetal outcomes after bariatric surgery is needed to better assess the true risks and benefits of birth after bariatric surgery to inform evidence-based guidelines.

National Clinician Scholars Program At The Institute For Healthcare Policy And Innovation,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;In an effort to improve perioperative and oncologic outcomes, there has been extensive centralization of complex cancer surgery over the past decade. However, high-volume centers are often located in urban areas, which may hinder access to high-quality surgical care for certain patient populations. In particular, patients living in areas with high social vulnerability may be disproportionally affected by centralization, leading to under-utilization of high-volume hospitals and worse postoperative outcomes.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Medicare beneficiaries who underwent liver or pancreas resection for cancer were identified using the 100% Medicare Inpatient Standard Analytic Files. Hospitals were designated as high-volume based on Leapfrog criteria.&nbsp;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&rsquo;s social vulnerability index (SVI) database was used to abstract community level vulnerability information based on each beneficiary&rsquo;s county of residence at the time of surgery.&nbsp;The probability of high-volume hospital utilization was assessed relative to social vulnerability of the patient&rsquo;s county of residence. Risk-adjusted postoperative outcomes were compared across low-, average-, and high- levels of vulnerability at both low- and high-volume hospitals.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Overall, 16,987 patients underwent either pancreatic (n=13,393, 78.8%) or liver resection (n=3,594, 21.2%) for cancer. Mean age was 73.3 (SD 5.8) years and roughly one-half of the cohort was male (n=9,168, 54%); the majority of patients were White (White: n=15,034, 88.5%), while a subset of the cohort was a non-White minority (Black: n=1,031, 6.1%; Hispanic: n=75, 0.4%; Asian: n=845, 5.0%). The average SVI was 49.8 (SD 24.8)(White: 48.9, SD 24.8 vs. minority: 57.0, SD 24.1). Surgery was performed at a high-volume hospital in one-half of patients (n=8,251, 48.6%)(White: n=7,447, 49.5% vs. minority: n=804, 41.2%;p&lt;0.001). On risk-adjusted analyses, minority patients had lower odds of surgery at a high-volume hospital (OR 0.74, 95%CI: 0.66-0.84). Similarly, patients from high SVI had lower odds of an operation at a high-volume hospital (OR 0.86, 95%CI:0.76-0.98). While postoperative complications and mortality were lower at high-volume hospitals, there was an increased risk of postoperative complications as SVI increased both at high-volume and low-volume hospitals (Figure). In particular, the incidence of complications at high-volume hospitals among low SVI patients was 20.3% (95%CI: 18.8-21.7) versus 25.7% (95%CI: 24.0-27.7) among high SVI patients. Similarly, mortality at high-volume hospitals among low SVI patients was 2.9% (95%CI: 2.3-3.5) versus 4.4% (95%CI: 3.6-5.1) among high SVI patients.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients from areas of higher social vulnerability were less likely to undergo pancreatic and liver resection at a high-volume hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;High SVI patients had a higher risk of postoperative complications and mortality following pancreatic and liver resection at both high- and low-volume hospitals. These data highlight the &ldquo;double disparity&rdquo; facing patients from high SVI areas and serve to emphasize the need to focus on community based factors to improve perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing complex cancer surgery.

Older recipients often experience graft failure; however, little is reported on re-KT. We characterized the trends in and outcomes after re-KT among older adults

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Among kidney-only recipients aged &ge;65 years (1995-2016) we identified those with re-KT in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. We analyzed trends by pre-defined eras (1995-2002, 2003-2014 and 2015-2016) based on policies affecting older adults. The risk (%) of outcomes (death-censored graft failure [DCGF], all-cause graft failure [ACGF], death) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimator. We compared outcomes stratified by age (65-69 vs. &ge;70) and explored age as a continuous variable using the restricted cubic splines regression.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Among 44,149 kidney alone transplants in recipients &ge;65 years from 1995-2016, only 3.9% were re-KTs; however, there has been a significant increase in this percentage over time (1995-2002:2.7%, 2003-2014:4.2%, 2015-2016:5.7%, p&lt;0.001) (Figure). Recipients at higher risk are undergoing re-KT; patients with PRA 80-100 (1995-2002:22.0%, 2003-2014:32.7%, 2015-2016:48.7%, p&lt;0.001), median survival of first KT in years (1995-2002:2.7, 2003-2014:6.5, 2015-2016:8.6, p&lt;0.001), years spent on dialysis after first graft failure (1995-2002:1.4, 2003-2014:1.5, 2015-2016:2.2, p=0.003) and those living with assistance (1995-2002:9.0%, 2003-2014:12.6%, 2015-2016:24.8%, p&lt;0.001) have increased. No major change in pre-emptive KT and living donation were noted. The 5-year cumulative incidence of DCGF, ACGF and death was 13.2% and 18.8%, 36% and 43.1%, and 29.4% and 38.5%, for re-KT recipients aged 65-69 and &ge;70, respectively. Compared with recipients aged 65, the risk of DCGF started to significantly increase at age 77, ACGF at age 72, and death at age 70.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;We report increasing trends in re-KT among older adults and favorable outcomes. While we acknowledge that only a subset is considered for a re-transplant, our results support increasing access to re-KT to older adults including those &ge;70 years.&nbsp;Further research is needed to understand the risk and benefit of re-KT among older population.

Racial disparities in access to LDKT are well recognized, yet they have increased in the last two decades. LDKT inequities have been largely attributed to contextual poverty and socioeconomic variability, however the association between LDKT and comprehensive measures of social vulnerability has not been characterized.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This retrospective study utilized the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to identify adult, kidney-only transplant recipients between 1/1/2018-12/31/2018. Census tract-level data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s 2018 Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), were linked to recipients by zip code. Logistic regression was utilized to evaluate the association between LDKT and SVI and race, controlling for patient- and community-level characteristics. Average adjusted predicted probabilities of LDKT across SVI were plotted by race.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;20,380 kidney-only transplant recipients were included, of which 30% received LDKT. Higher SVI (e.g., greater social vulnerability) was significantly associated with lower odds of LDKT (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.47,&nbsp;95% confidence interval (CI): 0.40-0.57, p&lt;0.0001). After controlling for SVI, African Americans (AAs) had 57% lower odds (aOR: 0.43,&nbsp;95%CI: 0.39-0.48, p&lt;0.0001)&nbsp;and other&nbsp;races had 45% lower odds (aOR: 0.55,&nbsp;95%CI: 0.48-0.63, p&lt;0.0001) of LDKT compared to their white counterparts. Average marginal effects for LDKT at the lowest SVI were 13% and 9% for AAs and other races, respectively, relative to white recipients (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Greater social vulnerability is significantly associated with lower odds of LDKT. Racial disparities in LDKT persist independent of social vulnerability, suggesting that other factors, such as sociocultural barriers and unconscious biases require greater attention to mitigate inequities.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive cutaneous malignancy with increasing incidence in recent years. Five-year survival rates from MCC range from 41-77%. Standard of care treatment includes concurrent radical excision of the primary tumor and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). We examine, from a contemporary large-scale Western cohort, the role of RT and SLNB on overall survival (OS).


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

All patients with MCC were identified using the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004-2016. Patients who underwent R0 surgical resection of MCC were stratified into four groups: SLNB, adjuvant RT, both SLNB and RT, and neither. Overall survival was calculated overall and stratified by clinical T stage using Kaplan-Meier curves, with hazard ratios (adjusted for age) calculated via Cox proportional hazards regression models.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

2,346 patients underwent surgical resection of their primary MCC with 290 (12.4%) receiving only RT, 842 (35.9%) receiving only SLNB, 368 (15.7%) receiving neither SLNB nor RT, and 846 (36%) receiving both. The addition of RT alone to radical excision demonstrated improved survival over surgical resection alone (median= 4.09 vs. 2.75 years, respectively, p=0.016). The utilization of SLNB is associated with a greater survival benefit on its own compared to RT (median= 7.18 vs. 4.09 years, respectively, p=.0114). The greatest survival benefit was appreciated with the combination of both RT and SLNB (median: 8.35 years, HR 0.59). This survival benefit was maintained in all MCC patients regardless of clinical T stage.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The combination of both RT and SLNB has a profound survival benefit in MCC, regardless of initial tumor size. We emphasize the underutilization of this standard-of-care combination in the NCDB. Despite the known benefit of RT, SLNB demonstrated a greater overall survival advantage. This is likely explained by an improved staging and subsequent tailored loco-regional management. Our results reiterate the importance of SLNB utilization and adjuvant radiotherapy in the management of MCC at all clinical T stages.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The National Cancer Database (2006-2015) was queried for curative-intent resection of lung, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, colon, rectal, or bladder cancer.&nbsp; Organ-specific TOO was defined as: adequate lymph node yield, R0 resection, non-length of stay outlier, no hospital readmission, and receipt of guideline-concordant chemotherapy and/or radiation. Mixed-effects analyses assessed factors associated with TOO, hospital organ-specific resection volume, and OS.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Among 502,173 cancer resections, TOO rates varied across cancer types (lung=32.9%, esophagus=30.3%, stomach=30.1%, pancreas=23%, colon=65.2%, rectum=43%, bladder=34.9%). &nbsp;There was wide hospital-level variation in risk-adjusted TOO rates with as much as 25-fold differences between the best and worst-performing hospitals (lung=3.5&ndash;75.3%; esophagus=3.3&ndash;63.3%; stomach=8.2&ndash;54.8%; pancreas=2.9&ndash;72.4%; colon=8.5&ndash;89.4%; rectum=17.7&ndash;72.6%; bladder=8.5&ndash;59.9%).&nbsp; Increasing hospital volume was independently associated with higher odds of TOO across cancer types (Table).&nbsp; After risk-adjustment, TOO was independently associated with improved OS (lung: HR=0.73, 95%CI=0.72-0.74; esophagus: HR=0.75, 95%CI=0.72-0.79; stomach: HR=0.57, 95%CI=0.54-0.60; pancreas: HR=0.75, 95%CI=0.73-0.78; colon: HR=0.56, 95%CI=0.55-0.57; rectum: HR=0.68, 95%CI=0.65-0.72; bladder: HR=0.74, 95%CI=0.71-0.77).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;TOO achievement varied widely across hospitals, and there was a direct association between hospital volume and TOO.&nbsp; Furthermore, TOO was independently associated with improved OS across all cancer types. &nbsp;Selective referral to high-volume centers for complex oncologic procedures is recommended to improve the likelihood of achieving optimal cancer outcomes.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between neighborhood deprivation status and outpatient and emergency care utilization among pediatric surgical patients.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We queried patients seen at pediatric surgery outpatient clinics in a tertiary children&rsquo;s hospital between 2017 and 2019. We also reviewed records of patients who underwent an operation during the same period. We included children younger than 18 years old residing in-state. We collected data on demographics, payer source, travel distance, and Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a neighborhood-level metric of socioeconomic disadvantage. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we evaluated predictors of missed outpatient visits, as well as predictors of missed postoperative outpatient visits and 30-day postoperative ED visits among those who underwent appendectomy or umbilical or inguinal hernia repair.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 10,162 patients made 24,576 outpatient clinic visits. Patients were 57% male, 52% white, 28% black, and 17% Hispanic. The median age was 5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1&ndash;13 years). 46% used commercial insurance whereas 52% were covered by Medicaid. Most patients lived in urban areas (93%) and relatively close to clinic; median distance was 15 miles (IQR, 9&shy;&ndash;40 miles), a median 21-minute drive (Figure 1). 14% of patients lived in neighborhoods classified within the most affluent ADI decile, whereas 21% presented from the most deprived [decile] neighborhoods. Among those in the most deprived neighborhoods, 91% were non-white, and 88% were covered by Medicaid. 16% missed at least one scheduled clinic visit. ADI (most deprived decile: odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% CI, 2.2&ndash;4.6), black race (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.9&ndash;4.2), and Medicaid insurance (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.3&ndash;3.3) were significant predictors of missed outpatient visits. Among 2,543 patients who underwent an appendectomy or inguinal/umbilical hernia repair, 20% missed their postoperative outpatient visit, and 5% presented to the ED within 30 days of the operation. ADI, black race, and Medicaid coverage were again significant predictors of access to care.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Notable variability in access to and utilization of healthcare resources was identified among pediatric surgical patients. Those presenting from deprived neighborhoods were less likely to access clinic and more likely to utilize ED resources. These findings highlight the need to promote health services programs targeting populations in deprived neighborhoods to mitigate emergency care costs and promote quality outpatient care.

Congenital and complex care requires specialist pediatric surgeons, thus the pediatric surgical workforce density (PSWD) is an indicator of progress toward access to complete pediatric care.&nbsp; Studies have demonstrated correlations between adult specialist surgical workforce density and maternal mortality rates, and between PSWD and improved survival of complex pediatric surgical problems.&nbsp; However, it is unknown if PSWD correlates with population-level health outcomes for children.&nbsp; We compared PSWD with neonatal, infant and under 5 childhood mortality rates and calculated the minimal PSWD associated with a significant reduction in mortality.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Using the WHO Global Surgical Workforce Database and publicly available medical licensing registries, the number of pediatric surgeons practicing in a convenience sample of 26 countries between 2015 &ndash; 2018 was identified.&nbsp; Corresponding national children&rsquo;s (&lt;15 years) population and neonatal-, infant- and under 5-mortality rates were obtained for each country. PSWD was calculated as the ratio of pediatric surgeons per 100,000 children.&nbsp; Each mortality rate was plotted as a function of PSWD and Spearman&rsquo;s correlations were used to assess the strength of correlation.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 4 LIC, 8 LMIC, 10 UMIC and 4 HIC countries were analyzed.&nbsp; The mean proportion of children &lt; 15 of the total population was 42.8% (LIC), 38.2% (LMIC), 21.6% (UMIC) and 18.7% (HIC).&nbsp; The median PSWD by income group was 0.03 (LIC), 0.12 (LMIC), 1.34 (UMIC) and 2.13 (HIC).&nbsp; PSWD strongly correlated with neonatal (0.70008, p&lt;0.003), infant (0.73878, p&lt;0.001) and under 5 (0.74337, p&lt;0.001) mortality rates. Population childhood survival rates increased significantly with increases in PSWD to a threshold of 0.3, beyond which further increases in PSWD correlated with small improvements in survival.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;PSWD correlates with population mortality rates for children, with a critical threshold of 0.3 PSWD associated with a significant increase in survival.&nbsp; This mirrors survival improvements seen for congenital and complex surgical care with a PSWD &gt;0.4/100,000 children. These novel findings suggest the current pediatric surgical workforce in LIC and LMICs, where a greater proportion of the population is less than 15 years old, is inadequate to meet UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.2 for infant and under 5-mortality.&nbsp; While PSWD is only one indicator of a system&rsquo;s ability to care for children, pediatric surgeons are an essential component of a functional health system and efforts to increase the training and retention of surgeons are needed to improve the survival of children globally.&nbsp;

Sheps Center For Health Services Research,Chapel Hill, NC, USA <sup>4</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill,Department Of Surgery, Division Of Surgical Oncology,Chapel Hill, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Primary hyperparathyroidism (HPTH) is one of the most common endocrine disorders surgeons encounter, and can have significant long-term health effects if left untreated. Few studies assess utilization and disparities in parathyroidectomy for HPTH outside of high-volume institutions. The objective of this study was to evaluate national usage and disparities in parathyroidectomy by race, geography and socioeconomic status (SES) for symptomatic HPTH among older adults with universal health insurance.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A 20% random sample of Medicare claims files were used to identify patients &gt;67 years old (to allow for a two-year lookback period) with a new diagnosis of HPTH from 2006-2017. &ldquo;Symptomatic&rdquo; was defined as having an additional diagnosis code for symptoms classically related to HPTH (eg. nephrolithiasis, osteopenia, pathologic fracture, etc.). Patients were followed from the first date they had documentation of both HPTH and at least one symptom, until receipt of parathyroidectomy, death, or December 31, 2017. Primary study variables were race (as reported in the claims), rurality (defined at county level using Rural Urban Continuum Codes) and SES (defined at the census-tract level using the Social Deprivation Index [SDI] categorized into quartiles). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify the association of our factors of interest with parathyroidectomy while adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and symptoms.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified 107,758 older adults with new diagnoses indicating symptomatic HPTH. The median age was 76 years (IQR 71-82). The cohort was 70% female, 82% non-Hispanic White, and 82% lived in urban areas. With a median follow-up time of 32 months (IQR 13-59), only 8.7% of patients (n=9,318) underwent parathyroidectomy. After adjustment, non-Hispanic Black patients&nbsp;compared to non-Hispanic White patients (HR 0.80 95% CI 0.73,0.87)&nbsp;and living in a low SES neighborhood compared to&nbsp;a high SES neighborhood (lowest SES quartile vs highest SES quartile&nbsp;HR 0.87 95% CI 0.81,0.92) were both associated with significantly lower incidences of parathyroidectomy. Patients from rural areas were more likely to undergo parathyroidectomy (isolated rural vs urban HR 1.43 95% CI 1.27,1.62).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
To our knowledge, this is the largest examination of the use of parathyroidectomy for symptomatic HPTH. Rates of parathyroidectomy were surprisingly low, even among an older patient population. Similar to disparities in access to other surgical procedures, racial minorities and those who live in poorer areas had a lower likelihood of parathyroidectomy even among a population with identical healthcare coverage. In contrast, rural patients had an increased likelihood of parathyroidectomy, but selection bias may contribute to this finding. Quality improvement efforts, rooted in equitable care, should be undertaken to increase access to parathyroidectomy for this disease.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a prospective observational cohort study of adult patients undergoing thyroidectomy from September 2016 to July 2019 at a single institution who provided consent and completed four&nbsp;HRQoL&nbsp;surveys: preoperative baseline, two weeks-, six months- and twelve months&nbsp;postoperatively. Patients were surveyed using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2) and the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). Exclusion criteria were prior thyroidectomy, concurrent parathyroidectomy, thyroid nodule or cancer over four centimeters, gross or lateral neck lymphadenopathy, Graves&rsquo; disease or a baseline BFI&nbsp;&gt; 60 or PHQ-9 &gt; 15. Patients with a BFI &gt; 60 at 12 months were defined as having asthenia. Demographic and clinicopathologic variables were assessed.&nbsp;HRQoL&nbsp;scores were compared between patients undergoing&nbsp;thyroid lobectomy (TL)&nbsp;or&nbsp;total&nbsp;thyroidectomy&nbsp;(TT)&nbsp;with benign or malignant final pathology. Our primary outcome was chronic asthenia by extent of surgery and final pathology. Continuous variables were&nbsp;analyzed&nbsp;using Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests and categorical variables using Chi-squared. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of&nbsp;182 patients&nbsp;were included: 67 (37%) with TL and benign pathology (TL-B), 32 (17%) with TL and cancer (TL-Ca), 40 (22%) with TT and benign pathology (TT-B), and 43 (24%) with TT and cancer (TT-Ca). There were no differences between the groups&nbsp;with regard to&nbsp;age, body mass index, comorbidities, or preoperative thyroid stimulating hormone level. Patients with benign pathology were more likely to report preoperative compressive symptoms 57% versus 35% (p = 0.002). There were no differences in complications except&nbsp;for&nbsp;TT&nbsp;which&nbsp;had a higher rate of temporary hypoparathyroidism&nbsp;in&nbsp;6 (7%) versus none with TL. &nbsp;Cancer patients had longer mean follow-up of 21.5 months versus 13.1 months (p &lt; 0.001). Baseline Physical Component (PCS) and Mental Component (MCS) Scores were similar between the groups, though BFI was higher in the cancer groups (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.001) (Figure 1). In the TL-B group, 2 patients (3%) developed asthenia, compared with 2 (6.25%)&nbsp;in the TL-Ca group, 14 (35%)&nbsp;in the TT-B group, and 21 (48.8%) in the TT-Ca group (p=0.0001). &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients with low risk well differentiated thyroid carcinoma report higher levels of moderate fatigue at baseline. In patients with both benign and malignant pathology who&nbsp;do&nbsp;not report high levels of fatigue at baseline, TT is associated with a higher rate of asthenia compared with TL. &nbsp;

Islam<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Florida,Pediatric Surgery,Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The Breast Imaging Reporting and Database System (BI-RADS) score is a validated classification system used for defining risk of malignancy, management and follow-up of breast masses identified on MRI and ultrasound imaging in the adult population. Prior studies validating the use of this system have failed to include significant proportions of pediatric patients in their analysis, despite its use in evaluation of breast masses in this population. While pediatric breast masses remain uncommon, with negligible malignancy potential, they can be of considerable concern to patients and families, and no clear consensus has been established regarding their evaluation and surgical management. Our study aims to evaluate for association between BI-RADS classification of pediatric breast masses and correlation to surgical pathology, as well as evaluating management practices at our institution.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients with ultrasound-confirmed breast masses with associated BI-RADS classification over a 9 year period were included. Demographic, clinical and imaging variables were collected. Patients were stratified based on ultrasound imaging characteristics as purely benign (BI-RADS &le; 2) or increased risk (BI-RADS &ge;3). Analysis of continuous variables was performed using t-test and categorical variables using two sample proportion test.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 780 pediatric patients were identified as having undergone surgical evaluation for breast mass over the time period studied. 507 were found to have had further evaluation with sonographic imaging and associated BI-RADS classification. Of these, 220 had purely benign imaging (BI-RADS &le; 2) and 287 were identified with BI-RADS classification of &ge; 3. Patients in both groups were found to be similar in age at presentation, age at menarche, BMI and laterality of lesions. The majority of masses were self-identified (83%). Patients with elevated risk based on radiographic classification had significantly larger average breast mass size (2.21 vs 1.47, p &lt; 0.0001). Surgical excision was performed in 14 patients with purely benign imaging, and 116 patients with BI-RADS &ge;3 (6% vs 40%, p&lt;0.0001). Surgical pathology was found to be benign in all but one case, with fibroadenoma being the most commonly observed pathology.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study represents one of the largest cohorts evaluating the role of the BI-RADS classification in guiding management of adolescent breast masses. These data suggest that use of the BI-RADS system in adolescents may not be helpful, with surgical excision leading to benign surgical pathology in almost all cases. Further work is needed to establish a separate radiographic classification system of breast masses in the pediatric population.

Implicit bias is a key factor preventing the advancement and retention of women and underrepresented minorities in academic surgery.&nbsp; Implicit bias is insidious and difficult to measure objectively.&nbsp; Recent work has identified implicit bias in granting of operative autonomy as well as the language used in residency training evaluations.&nbsp; We sought to examine the role of implicit bias as it pertains to the technical component of the residency performance evaluation.&nbsp; An objective, blinded measure of technical performance, the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) score was compared to a subjective measure of performance, the technical evaluation score given by attending surgeons.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

FLS scores and the average technical evaluation scores&nbsp;from chief resident performance evaluations at a university training program were analyzed from 2015-2019 (n=29 residents;&nbsp;female 21%, underrepresented minorities 31%).&nbsp; The residency performance evaluation contains 7&nbsp;domains of practice which are scored on a scale of 1-4.&nbsp; The average technical skills score for each chief resident was&nbsp;determined&nbsp;from this evaluation; residents were evaluated by an average of 10 attending surgeons.&nbsp; Results were analyzed&nbsp;for subjects&rsquo; gender, ethnicity and race.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There were no significant differences in FLS scores between male and female trainees (p=0.3).&nbsp; There was a trend toward decreased technical evaluation scores for female trainees, but it was not significant (p=0.27).&nbsp; There were no significant differences in FLS or technical evaluation scores between racial/ethnic groups (p=0.56, 0.52).&nbsp; FLS and technical evaluation scores, respectively, were dichotomized into above and below the mean for the training program, in order to compare the relationship between individual residents&rsquo; FLS score and their technical evaluation score.&nbsp; The Kappa correlation coefficient between the two dichotomized scores was significantly lower for female (-0.50) vs. male (0.23) trainees (p&lt;0.01).&nbsp; The Kappa correlation coefficient was not significantly different between racial/ethnic groups (p=0.51).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

This is the first study to examine implicit bias in the technical component of the surgical resident evaluation.&nbsp; The subjective technical performance evaluation score was compared to the blinded Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery score.&nbsp; Although there were no differences in average scores between groups, there was a statistically significant difference in agreement between the FLS and technical evaluation scores for&nbsp;individual female and male trainees.&nbsp; This suggests the presence of implicit bias in our pilot study.&nbsp; Identification of implicit bias is the first step toward&nbsp;its eradication.&nbsp; Further research with a larger sample size is warranted.&nbsp;

We hypothesized that&nbsp;leadership of major US&nbsp;general surgery societies over the last decade reflected these same&nbsp;disparities. We aimed to determine whether there is an association between attending a prestigious medical school or residency program and surgeons attaining national societal leadership positions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Race (using personal knowledge or publicly available information) and visible (binary) gender of the 2020-21 executive council members&nbsp;of 11 major general surgery societies and the presidents of these societies 2012-2021 was assessed. Top 10 and Top 20 medical school and surgery residency programs were identified using public ranking programs. International medical graduates (IMGs) were excluded from the &ldquo;Top programs&rdquo; analysis. Fisher&rsquo;s exact test was used to compare groups and Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to assess change over time.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Surgical society executive council members in 2020-21 (n=77) were predominantly White (74%, n=57) and male (67.5%, n=52). The 20 non-White council members were Asian (80%), Black (10%), and Latino (10%). Nine (11.7%) executive leaders were IMGs; five were White (55.6%). Many 2020-21 executive leaders (41%, n = 28) attended Top 10 and majority (58.8%, n=40) attended a Top 20 medical school/residency. When evaluated by race and gender, 30% of White men, 43.5% of women, and 66.7% of non-White men in executive leadership roles attended Top 10 schools/residency. In the last decade, surgical society presidents (n=105) have been mostly White (85.7%, n=90) and male (78.1%, n=82). Non-White male surgical society presidents have been Asian (39%, n=9), Black (23.1%, n=3), and Latino (7.7%, n=1). Of the 23 female surgery society presidents, 91.3% have been White, 8.7% Asian, and none Black or Latina. Eleven society presidents were&nbsp;IMGs (10.5%);&nbsp;most were White (80%). Society presidents attended Top 10 (36.2%) or Top 20 (56.4%)&nbsp;schools/residency. Fewer White male society presidents attended Top schools/programs compared to non-White male presidents (Top 10: 32.3% vs. 60%; p=0.15; and Top 20: 56.5% vs 80%; p=0.3). There has been no significant change over the last decade in society presidents in terms of race or gender.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Women, non-White surgeons, and IMGs are underrepresented in US surgical society leadership. Most IMGs in societal leadership are White. Nearly 60% of societal leaders in the last 10 years attended a Top 20 medical school or residency program. While not statistically significant, a higher percentage of non-White men in leadership attended a prestigious school/residency program compared to White men. These data suggest that increasing racial diversity in US surgical societies may require mentorship and sponsorship particularly for surgeons who did not attend prestigious medical schools or residency programs.&nbsp;

Parental leave policies for trainees and practicing physicians are crucial for wellness in the workplace, yet standardized practices are lacking.&nbsp;&nbsp;While exploring options for our institutional trainee parental leave policy, we performed a widespread survey through social media. In this study, we aimed to compare experiences of individuals who became parents during surgical training programs compared to those in non-surgical training programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We designed and distributed an electronic survey to physician-parents via social media groups and a graduate medical education database between October 2019 and February 2020. Responses were collected using a web-based application, and standard descriptive and comparative analyses were performed.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

We received 64 responses from participants practicing or training in various medical specialties including 48 (74%) non-surgical respondents (NSR) and 16 (26%) surgical respondents (SR). All respondents had experienced the entry of a child/children into their families during their training (including college, medical school, residency, or fellowship). Of NSR, 93% delivered their child vs. 95% of SR (p=0.84); 5% of SR had their partner deliver their child.&nbsp;

Among all-comers, respondents took a mean of 7.5&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;5.2 weeks off (range, 0-14) after child delivery. Interestingly, NSR took 8.7&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;5.8 weeks of leave, while SR took 4.7&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;2.7 (p=0.006, Figure 1). A minority of respondents (25/64, 39%)&nbsp;reported a formal institutional policy for parental leave during their training. Most (49/64, 76%) respondents wished they could have had more time off.&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked to identify barriers for taking more leave, respondents reported similar issues across specialties, including challenges with graduation requirements (NSR 58% vs. SR 68% p=0.46), peer pressure or colleague perception (NSR 59% vs. SR 58% p=0.97), and pressure from institutional leadership (NSR 31% vs. SR 35% p=0.77).&nbsp;

Forty-three percent (28/64) respondents had additional children during training.&nbsp;Overall, parent-trainees took less time off for the second child with a mean of 5.1&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;7.4 weeks (range, 0-12) after delivery.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Less than half of respondents reported the presence of formal parental leave policies for trainees at their institutions. The majority of trainee-parents reported wishing they had more time off. Surgical trainees took less time off after delivery than their non-surgical counterparts, which may be related to procedural volume-related requirements.&nbsp;Cultural and professional changes are crucial&nbsp;in o promoting wellness and healthy transitions into parenthood for surgical trainees.&nbsp;

We aim to assess the scholarly interest level in diversity and inclusion of the academic general surgery community over the last three decades and compare this with other surgical subspecialties.



<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Grey Literature Report databases were evaluated for publications from 1990 to 2020 regarding women and racial/ethnic minorities in surgery and surgical subspecialties in the United States. Search terms included, &quot;women/female,&quot; &quot;gender,&quot; &quot;minorities,&quot; &quot;race/racial,&quot; &quot;ethnic/ethnicity,&quot; &quot;pipeline,&quot; &quot;underrepresented/underrepresentation/ representation,&quot; &quot;african/black,&quot; &quot;latino/hispanic,&quot; &quot;diversity/diverse,&quot; AND &quot;(neuro, general, plastic, etc.) surgery,&quot; &quot;academic,&quot; &quot;faculty,&quot; &quot;resident,&quot; &quot;fellow,&quot; &quot;student,&quot; &ldquo;department/division.&rdquo;

First-generation, low-income (FGLI) and LGBT+ data was excluded from general surgery analysis due to a paucity of literature and overall lack of available information.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Thirty-eight publications have examined diversity in general surgery (gender, n=25; race/ethnicity/UIM, n=10; gender + race/ethnicity/UIM, n=3). General surgery has significantly more literature published per year regarding gender diversity (0.81 publications/ year) than ethnic/ racial diversity (0.32 publications/ year) (p = 0.036).

Every specialty demonstrated a significant increase in publications about diversity over time (p&lt;0.05), with the most marked increases seen in general surgery (+0.10 publications/year, R= 0.5, p= 0.002), plastic surgery (+0.10 publications/year, R = 0.6, p&lt;0.001), and orthopedic surgery (+0.13 publications/year, R = 0.5, p= 0.01).

Trends in UIM trainee representation revealed no significant increase in residents and fellows in any surgical specialty (p&gt; 0.05), while gender diversity has increased significantly for all specialties (p&lt;0.05), with plastic surgery exhibiting the highest growth rate in female residents (+1.6% per year, R = 0.985, p&lt; 0.001) compared to all other surgical specialties.



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Scholarly interest from general surgery in women and UIM surgeons has increased over time (p&lt;0.05), yet this increased interest has only correlated with an increase in women&#39;s&nbsp;representation. While general surgery has more diversity publications than many surgical subspecialties, this does not translate to a parallel increase in UIM surgeon representation. Especially in the context of&nbsp;recent&nbsp;events, in order to enact meaningful change in the landscape of academic general surgery, our field must change its culture to prioritize diversity and inclusion.

Chen<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Female medical students now outnumber their male counterparts. Female representation is increasing in general surgery residency (41.3% in 2019) and in the surgical work force (20.6% in 2017).&nbsp; However, women remain under represented in surgical leadership (18% of program directors in 2018 and 3% of department chairs in 2015). With the current growth rate, women are not expected to reach professorship parity in surgery until 2136. Suggested reasons for this discrepancy are lack of female role models, lack of mentorship and support, and gender discrimination.
&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Leadership data from an academic Department of Surgery in 2016 and 2020 was reviewed. Demographic data included gender, division, age, and leadership position. Leadership positions were defined as chair, vice chair, director (division, program, medical education), program leader, or associate chief. Comparisons were analyzed using chi-squared testing.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Female representation in leadership roles increased significantly from 2016 to 2020. One hundred percent of female professors hold leadership roles in 2020 compared to 0% in 2016 (p&lt;.001). Among associate professors, 90% hold leadership roles in 2020 compared to 25% in 2016 (p&lt;.001). Among assistant professors, 71% hold leadership roles compared to 7% in 2016 (p&lt;.001). There was no significant difference in the age of female surgeons in leadership from those not in leadership (44 years vs 44 years, p=.521). Significantly more women in leadership roles held an MD than a PhD (91.3% vs 4.3%, p=.001), while one woman in leadership had an MD, PhD. There was no significant difference in leadership roles based on subspecialty (p=.058). During this period, there was a trend towards increasing numbers of women on the faculty (19.8% vs 26.4%, p=.27).

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Female leadership in an academic Department of Surgery has increased significantly since 2016. Promoting qualified female candidates to leadership roles provides role models for upcoming female surgeons. Resources should be allocated to continue the growth of gender equity in surgical leadership.

Bingham<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Madigan Army Medical Center,Tacoma, WA, USA <sup>2</sup>William Beaumont Army Medical Center,El Paso, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  While previous studies have explored factors influencing medical students&rsquo; choice of specialty, there remains a relative paucity of data examining how these factors differ between males and females. With females now comprising over 50% of all medical students, it is unclear if this shift in demographics will translate to differences in how students ultimately choose a medical specialty. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if differences exist in how male and female medical students value various factors when choosing a career path in medicine.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A survey of basic demographic information and a Likert-based questionnaire addressing various factors in specialty choice was sent to all military medical students in the class of 2019. Univariate analysis was conducted for continuous variables using T-test and categorical variables using &chi;<sup>2 </sup>analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The survey response rate was 30%, of which 72% were male and 28% were female. The majority of students were less than 27 years old (52%) and Caucasian (77%).&nbsp; After analyzing the factors that impacted specialty choice, female medical students placed greater importance on exposure to third year clerkships (p=0.004) and gender diversity within the specialty (p=0.03) than their male counterparts. Presence of mentors (p=0.07) and diverse ethnic representation within the specialty (p=0.07) trended towards greater importance among female students compared to males, but this difference was not statistically significant. Statistically more female medical students had a mentor in the specialty they applied to as compared to males (p=0.009). There were no gender-specific differences with regard to opinions of significant others or family members, desire to have a family, or having a well-balanced life.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Female medical students valued exposure during third year clerkships, mentorship, and gender and ethnic diversity more than their male colleagues when choosing a future specialty in medicine. Although female applicant&rsquo;s desire to have a family and work-life balance is often touted as justification for the lack of gender equality in particular specialties, our study did not find this to be the case. Our findings support the need for diverse representation in medical leadership and highlights the importance of early career mentorship beginning at the medical student level in order to ensure diversity and equality in the medical workforce.

Hughes<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan,Department Of Surgery,Ann Arbor, MI, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Michigan,Department Of Anesthesiology,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Anxiety and distress following a cancer diagnosis is pervasive, although its impact on decision-making and care delivery is incompletely understood. Anxiety and depression among breast cancer patients are well described during survivorship, but data from earlier phases of diagnosis are lacking. Additionally, little is known about differences in distress across cancers. We explored differences in peri-operative negative affect in breast cancer patients compared to other cancer patients undergoing surgery similar in scope. We hypothesized that expressed or experienced anxiety and stress is higher in patients with breast cancer compared to patients with melanoma.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We identified all adult patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer or melanoma in a large, prospective registry of surgical patients that includes pre- and post-operative psychosocial measures. Men with breast cancer were excluded due to small sample size. Patients were grouped based on cancer type (breast cancer, melanoma) and subsequently gender and cancer type. PROMIS Anxiety and Depression Scores and Perceived Stress Scale responses were compared across groups using Student&rsquo;s T-test, with a p-value of less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 951 patients were included: 386 women with breast cancer (mean age 57 yrs), 232 women with melanoma (mean age 56 yrs), and 333 men with melanoma (mean age 63 yrs). Patients with breast cancer had higher anxiety scores overall compared to patients with melanoma (8.4 vs 6.9, p&lt;0.001). However, when comparing women with breast cancer and women with melanoma, PROMIS Anxiety scores were similar (8.4 vs 7.9, p=0.122), and this did not change when adjusting for age. Men with melanoma had significantly lower anxiety scores compared with women with melanoma (6.3 vs 7.9, p&lt; 0.001), an effect that also persisted despite age adjustment. Perceived stress was similar for women with breast cancer or melanoma (4.8 vs 4.6, p=0.519), though women with melanoma had modestly higher stress scores than men with melanoma (4.1 vs 4.6, p=0.042).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Overall, women with breast cancer expressed higher levels of anxiety and stress compared to individuals with melanoma; however, when melanoma patients were sub-grouped based on gender, there was no significant difference between women with breast cancer and women with melanoma. This may indicate that women undergoing treatment for cancers have psychosocial needs that are currently unmet by existing systems of care. This patient population may benefit from further qualitative study to identify drivers of anxiety and stress at the time of surgery, in order to improve their experience of cancer care. This may indicate underlying gender differences in patterns of response to negative affect measures such as PROMIS Anxiety and Perceived Stress Scale, although both have been previously shown to maintain validity across gender.

We have previously shown that local delivery of a CNP-miR146a-Chitosan gel enema into the Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS)-murine model of colitis/IBD results in decreased TNF-alpha expression within the injured colon as well as clinical improvements including decreased blood in stool and more formed stools. CNP-miR146a is a novel conjugate that combines free-radical scavenging cerium oxide nanoparticle (CNP) and anti-inflammatory microRNA, miR146a, that synergistically targets both oxidative stress and inflammation, as is seen in IBD. Here we propose that local administration of CNP-miR146a in a Chitosan gel enema would also result in decreased gross pathologic and histopathologic findings of the mouse colon.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;C57BL/6J age-matched mice (n=15) were divided equally into three groups. The control group received regular water and a PBS enema on experiment day three. The IBD colitis mice received 3% DSS water to induce colitis and a PBS enema or a CNP-miR146a enema on experiment day three. Mice were sacrificed on experiment day six and their colon length was measured and then placed in 10% formalin solution, fixed and then stained with H&amp;E. We used a modified published scoring model to score each of the H&amp;E slides for all groups. The division of points fell broadly into three categories: Inflammatory cell infiltrate (0-7 points), epithelial changes, (0-25 points) and mucosal architecture alterations (0-25 points) for a maximum total score of 57.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The average colon length for the control group was 6.75 cm, which was shortened in the diseased group at 4.9 cm, and improved for the treated group at 5.6 cm. The average histology score of the control group was 1.25, of the diseased group was 20.8, and of the treated group was 13.4 (p&lt;0.05 for all groups). We observed improvement in crypt and villous architecture, decreased inflammatory cell infiltrate, and less goblet cell loss and variability in the treatment group as compared to the diseased group.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;These results demonstrate that there is improved colon length along with lessened histological disease severity in the colon tissue of DSS-colitis mice when treated with a single therapeutic CNP-miR146a enema as compared to a PBS enema. These finding support the clinical improvements previously observed and highlight the potential of CNP-miR146a as a promising treatment for IBD.

Intestinal neuropathies such as Hirschsprung disease may be amenable to cellular therapies to replace missing enteric neurons. Identifying an autologous source of neuronal progenitors would obviate the need for immunosuppression. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells are a potential autologous source, but induction protocols are inefficient and time consuming. Enteric glial cells are capable of undergoing neurogenesis when stimulated by inflammation in vivo or when cultured in differentiation conditions ex vivo. This suggests glial cells are a persistent pool of neuronal progenitors in the postnatal gut. In this study, we use single cell RNA sequencing to test the hypothesis that postnatal enteric glial cells maintain a transcriptional program resembling embryonic neuronal precursors.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Plp1::GFP reporter mice expressing GFP from the glial-specific Plp1 promoter were euthanized on day 14 of postnatal life and the longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus layer (LMMP) of the small intestine was isolated. The LMMP was enzymatically digested and glial cells isolated by sorting for GFP+ cells. cDNA libraries were constructed using a 10X Genetics Chromium Controller. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq instrument. Genome alignment was performed with the Cell Ranger pipeline. Spliced and unspliced RNA counts were determined with the Velocyto software package. Data were processed and analyzed using Seurat and scVelo software packages. Gene ontology analysis was conducted with the ClusterProfiler R package. Data from GFP+ glial cells was compared with a published dataset of embryonic enteric nervous system (ENS) cells. The datasets were integrated using two algorithms, one using embryonic cells as a reference set and one with a joint learning approach for unbiased integration.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Lineage inference based on spliced/unspliced RNA ratios in the embryonic dataset reveals a clear differentiation trajectory from ENS stem cells to early neurons. Dataset integration demonstrates that postnatal enteric glial cells have transcriptional profiles closely matching both ENS stem cells and proliferating embryonic neuronal progenitors. Some transcriptional differences exist between embryonic cells and postnatal glia.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Postnatal enteric glial cells have a transcriptional signature closely resembling embryonic ENS stem cells and embryonic neuronal progenitors, supporting our hypothesis that postnatal glia represent a persistent pool of incompletely differentiated ENS cells. This finding may explain the ability of glial cells to transition to a neuronal phenotype in the postnatal gut. Enteric glia are an attractive source of autologous cells for regenerative therapies for Hirschsprung disease and other intestinal neuropathies.

This pathological ECM encases the lumen to become a virtual &ldquo;lead pipe,&rdquo; blocking the efficacy of vasodilatory anti-PH drugs.&nbsp;Prior data suggest that abnormal remodeling of the pulmonary vascular ECM&nbsp;results from endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), which contributes to PH.&nbsp;During EndoMT, endothelial cells lose the expression of markers CD31 and vWF and acquire an elongated and fusiform myofibroblast-like morphology and express mesenchymal lineage specific markers &alpha;-SMA and type I collagen. Our pre-clinical and clinical data show that CDH is accompanied by increased expression of EndoMT markers, leading to our hypothesis that EndoMT contributes to the pathologic vascular ECM remodeling seen in CDH.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A&nbsp;biobank of pulmonary samples of deceased CDH patients with respective pre- and post-natal clinical data was used&nbsp;to investigate the reciprocal loss of endothelial markers and acquisition of a mesenchymal lineage in human and&nbsp;Slit3<sup>-/-</sup>&nbsp;murine CDH models. Three pairs of control and diseased human and murine samples were stained with CD31 and &alpha;-SMA using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Expression of DII4, a transmembrane protein of the Notch ligand pathway, was evaluated by qRT-PCR. CDH vessels were then isolated using laser capture microdissection (LCM) with subsequent proteomic evaluation to determine pathways upregulated in the pathologic vessels.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Data from&nbsp;IHC of&nbsp;lung tissue sections from human CDH patients revealed co-labeling of CD31 and &alpha;-SMA in the pulmonary artery endothelium, indicating ongoing EndoMT that could lead to vascular ECM remodeling and PH. Similarly, lungs from&nbsp;Slit3<sup>-/-</sup>&nbsp;mice showed &alpha;-SMA and CD31 double-stained endothelial cells, suggestive of EndoMT. Expression of Dll4, a vascular endothelial ligand associated with EndoMT, was upregulated in both human and mouse CDH samples. Consistent with IHC data, proteomic profiling of LCM-dissected vessels from human CDH tissues&nbsp;detected fifty-three proteins associated with ECM pathways,&nbsp;suggesting a role for EndoMT in vascular remodeling and CDH-PH development.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our results reveal that infants with CDH have increased expression of biomarkers associated with EndoMT. The results of our study also suggest that EndoMT may play a role in the pathologic vascular ECM remodeling leading to CDH-PH. Due to this new data, there is a significant need to further investigate the underlying pathogenesis of CDH-PH for potential therapeutic targets to develop effective anti-PH drugs.

Several cell lines are used to study the underlying cellular mechanisms and potential therapeutics in vitro. HB is a heterogenous disease process; however, the most common pathologic subtypes are epithelial. In&nbsp;many other epithelial cancers&nbsp;proprotease enzymes, such as furin, have been implicated as molecular targets with a focus on the ability of furin inhibitors (FI) to decrease proliferation. The combination of an unknown underlying mechanism and low mutational burden in HB coupled with furin&rsquo;s regulatory role in growth pathways, such as TGF-B, IGF, and Wnt, make furin a interesting target for further investigation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Lyophilized FI (Sigma Aldrich, SCP0148) was resuspended in DMSO. Either FI or DMSO was added to media to reach a final concentration of 200 &micro;M.&nbsp; HepG2 and SK Hep1, two liver derived cell lines, were incubated with either FI/media or DMSO/media and a WST proliferation assay (Takara, MK400) assessed for variations in the proliferation response. At 72 hours&nbsp;a WST assay was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In HepG2 cells, the addition of FI resulted in increased proliferation at 72 hours at the 200 &micro;M concentration. On the contrary, the SK Hep1 cells demonstrated decreased proliferation after incubation with FI compared to DMSO controls at 72 hours for this specific concentration of FI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;FIs have shown therapeutic promise in several epithelial cancers, including breast, head and neck&nbsp;and gastrointestinal cancers. However, in hepatic cell lines used to study HB we have shown a disparate proliferation response to the addition of a single concentration of FI. SK Hep1 mirrors other epithelial cancers with a decrease in proliferation at 200 &micro;M FI concentration&nbsp;likely due to the regulatory role of furin in key growth pathways. However, HepG2 cells showed an increased proliferation rate in response to 200 &micro;M addition of FI at 72 hours. Further elucidation of the mechanisms underlying this difference, in coordination&nbsp;with&nbsp;continued study of additional dose responses, may clarify the role of FI as a potential therapeutic for HB.&nbsp;

The recurrence risk for an NTD in a subsequent pregnancy is 20x higher.&nbsp; The risk for a second recurrence is 40x.&nbsp; The predisposition to having children affected by NTDs has not been explained and may relate to differential surveillance by the maternal immune system.&nbsp; Given that natural killer (NK) cells are the most prevalent lymphocyte at the maternal-fetal interface, we hypothesized is that maternal NK cells are necessary for selective fetal absorption with the development of an NTD.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We challenged this hypothesis in an outbred murine model of valproic acid (VA)-induced fetal neural tube teratogenesis (NTT). VA-induced teratogenesis was performed of pregnant CD1 dams at E8.&nbsp; To evaluate protection from NTT&rsquo;s, maternal NK cells were either selectively eliminated (mAb PK136) or functionally augmented (IFNg) prior to VA administration (E7). All litters were harvested on E14 and prevalence of NTT compared between each treatment group and untreated controls.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We found that the frequency of litters with VA-induced NTT was significantly higher when maternal NK cells were selectively depleted (100% vs 83%, p&lt;0.05).&nbsp; Importantly, NK-depleted dams also had more litters with pups affected by exencephaly that were not absorbed (96.8% vs 74.3%, p&lt;0.05). Conversely, IFNg-augmented litters were less likely to be affected by NTT (69.2%; p&lt;0.05) and were less likely to have fetuses with exencephaly that were not also being absorbed (53.8%, p&lt;0.05). Litter sizes were similar between the groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These findings demonstrate that selective fetal absorption for NTT hinges on intact maternal NK cell function.&nbsp; Enhanced protection from NTT can be achieved through augmented maternal NK cell function. Further studies are needed to define the mechanisms by which maternal NK cells recognize and prevent aberrant fetal development.

Short bowel syndrome (SBS), a clinical condition which affects over 5000 children in the USA each year, occurs when the body is unable to absorb food after loss of large segments of intestine. We have previously shown that circulating factors can protect against intestinal injury in models of intestinal inflammation, suggesting the possibility that parabiotic pairing can improve adaptation in SBS. We now hypothesize that the presence of a parabiotic partner will improve outcome in the setting of short bowel syndrome.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Four to six-week-old wild-type (WT) (recipient) and red labelled tdTomato (donor) mice were engineered into parabiotic pairs, in which mice were surgically joined to create a shared circulation. 75% of small bowel was removed and a primary jejuno-ileal anastomosis created on the recipient&nbsp;mouse within each pair. Weights were monitored over 7 days, after which mice were euthanized and gut tissue collected to assess for expression of various proliferation and differentiation genes.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We discovered that the presence of a parabiotic partner with intact bowel surprisingly protected the WT mouse with short gut from the extent of weight loss observed in singleton short gut WT mouse. WT short gut mice in parabiotic pairs were found to be close to their original body weight by day 7. For each parabiosis pair, assessment of expression levels of various proliferation and differentiation genes such as GLP-2, Wnt, Notch and Lgr5 in gut tissue obtained from recipient WT mice and donor TdRed showed substantial differences in levels and patterns of expression between short gut pairs and control pairs.&nbsp;

Bile acids are becoming increasingly recognized as important signaling molecules in the intestine. Previous work from our lab suggests that different bile acid metabolites can contribute to either cell death or cell protection within the intestinal epithelium. These processes are major contributors to injury in intestinal disease. Mechanisms of controlled cell death can be categorized at apoptotic and necroptotic. The goal of our investigation was to examine the role of bile acid metabolites on cell death in the intestinal epithelium and the pathways of cell death.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Rat small intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) were purchased and maintained in cell culture media, Cells were synchronized in serum starved media for 24 hours prior to treatments with LCA, UDCA, or the combination. Cell death was measured using a modified MTS-based assay. Protein levels were assessed with Western blot analysis using antibodies for&nbsp;cleaved caspase 3 (CCSP3), caspase 3, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
LCA caused 50% cell death at a concentration of 50 uM when IEC6 cells were treated for 24 hours, while it took a concentration of 500 uM of UDCA to product the same affect, again over 24 hours. To determine the mechanism of LCA-induced cell death, we probed cell lysates exposed to LCA for CCSP3. LCA caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in CCSP3 expression, which was maximized at a concentration of 75uM versus untreated controls. Expression was first noted to increase at the 15 minute time point, becoming most robust at one hour. There was no change in RIPK3 or MLKL expression, suggesting that the necroptosis pathway was not involved. UDCA treatment did not change CCSP3 expression in the dose or time dependent trials. Interestingly, treating cells with UDCA at concentrations of both 200mM and 500&nbsp;mM blocked LCA-induced CCSP3 expression. When cells were co-treated with UDCA and LCA, the cytotoxic effects of LCA were blunted.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
LCA seems to cause cell death via increasing cleavage of caspase 3 promoting the apoptotic pathway but does not alter the necroptosis pathway. UDCA protects cells from LCA-induced cell death in part by blocking caspase 3 cleavage, preventing cells from undergoing apoptosis. These opposing effects of bile acids may provide a role for manipulation of bile acid concentrations in diseases where intestinal epithelial cell death is abundant.&nbsp;

Martin<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Uncontrolled activation of inflammatory cascades by the immature neonatal immune system contributes to the development of many pediatric diseases including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Infants develop NEC in the first 2-3 weeks of life characterized by mucosal injury, necrosis, perforation, and microbial dysbiosis. While the mechanism(s) of pathogenesis is unknown, it is believed to have multifactorial causes. Because women in psychologically stressful environments have a higher incidence of adverse birth outcomes, we hypothesized that psychological stress during pregnancy negatively impacts the development of intestinal tissues in offspring. To understand how stress affects gut development, in this study, we investigated the molecular changes in the offspring gut following prenatal psychological stress.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Pregnant dams were subject to psychological stress during gestation days 7-20 and the offspring were analyzed after birth. To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), RNA was isolated from the colon of 2wk old mice derived from dams that were either stressed or not stressed and sequenced at a high-resolution.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 15 DEGs were identified in the colon tissues. In a principal component analysis, unlike males, stressed females clustered separately from controls. 13 genes were downregulated and 2 Metallothionein (MT) genes (MT1 &amp;MT2) were upregulated in females. No DEGs were found in males indicating that the effects of gestational stress are sex-dependent. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed a 4 fold increase in the expression of MT1 and MT2 in colon tissues. MTs are a family of metal-binding proteins that regulate homeostasis of zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu). In recent years, MTs have emerged as an important, yet largely underappreciated component of the immune system.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Several critical genes and relevant pathways were revealed in this study, notably the modulation of genes involved in zinc metabolism. These findings are consistent with reports that show a decrease in serum zinc levels following acute stress, indicating a link between cortisol and zinc. &nbsp;Ongoing studies are focused on understanding how&nbsp;alterations in the zinc metabolism in the neonatal gut following maternal stress lead to the development of tissue injury and inflammation.

Harting<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>McGovern Medical School at UTHealth,Pediatric Surgery,Houston, TX, USA <sup>2</sup>McGovern Medical School at UTHealth,Anesthesia,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Early cardiac dysfunction is common amongst infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and has been uniquely implicated as a cause of morbidity and mortality amongst CDH patients. Despite the recognition of this clinical problem, the underlying pathogenesis of CDH-related cardiac dysfunction remains unclear. Our objective was to uncover molecular derangements in the pathogenesis of CDH-associated cardiac dysfunction.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We used the well-characterized nitrofen CDH rodent model. At birth, hearts were collected from both control and CDH pups. Only pups with large diaphragmatic defects (CDH study group stage C or D equivalent) underwent tissue harvest. Whole tissue RNA was extracted and submitted to NOVOGENE Corp. for RNA sequencing. The resulting fragments per kilobase million data were used to estimate gene expression levels, and genes with an adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 and an absolute fold change &gt;1 were considered to be differentially expressed. Pathway analyses were performed using differentially expressed genes with DAVID 6.8 and Revigo. Biological pathways with a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.05 were considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 26,690 analyzed genes, 50 had significantly different expression between CDH and control heart tissue (n = 3 for both groups). 26 genes were downregulated in CDH hearts (median fold change 1.29, range 1.15 &ndash; 6.5), and 24 genes were upregulated (median fold change 1.65, range 1.17 &ndash; 12.99). Pathway analyses of these genes revealed that, compared to controls, CDH cardiac tissue RNA was significantly upregulated in hypoxia-related biological pathways (Figure). One pathway, glycolytic processes, was significantly downregulated in CDH pups (FDR &lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In conclusion, CDH cardiac tissue shows significant upregulation of RNA related to biological processes involved in both the tissue and cellular responses to hypoxia. CDH-associated cardiac dysfunction may be strongly linked to hypoxia in the immediate postnatal period. Additionally, these data pinpoint specific areas for further investigation and potential therapeutic targets.

This results in loss of lower limb motor function, causing paralysis. Historically MMC was treated with postnatal repair of the spinal cord defect, but after the landmark Management of Myelomeningocele Study, prenatal repair became the standard of care. Prenatal surgery resulted in improvements in motor function, however 55% of prenatally repaired children were still unable to walk independently, representing an opportunity to further augment the recovery of the damaged neurologic tissue.&nbsp; We have developed a PMSC-ECM product [placental derived mesenchymal stromal cells (PMSCs) seeded on a Dural Extracellular Matrix (ECM)] to augment the prenatal repair of the defect. In order to support the clinical use of the stromal cell products manufactured under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP), we conducted preclinical safety testing of our PMSC-ECM in an established tumorigenicity murine model. Our hypothesis was that the clinical grade PMSC-ECM product would not result in local or distant tumor formation.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  PMSCs were obtained from consented donor human placentas. Prior to surgery, the cells were seeded onto a 6mm diameter ECM at a density of 3x10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Immunodeficient Nod SCID gamma mice were randomized to receive either ECM only or PMSC-ECM, delivered via a 1-2 cm skin incision on the back and placed in a subcutaneous pocket. Mice were monitored weekly for tumor formation until two study endpoints: 4 weeks and 6 months. Post-mortem analysis included pathology and histology on all tissues to examine for tumors and biodistribution by QPCR analysis of the implantation site and lung tissue for the presence of human DNA.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In total, 54 mice were included, 13 ECM only and 14 PMSC-ECM in the 4-week group and 13 ECM only and 14 PMSC-ECM in the 6-month group. No mice had gross or histological evidence of tumor development or specific histologic findings suggesting treatment-related adverse effects. There was no evidence of impaired wound healing at the site of implantation of PMSC-ECM. PCR results showed that no mice had human DNA detected at either 4 weeks or 6 months in either the implantation site tissue or lung tissue.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Subcutaneous implantation of our PMSC-ECM product did not result in tumor formation in the permissive environment of an immune deficient murine model. We found no evidence that PMSCs persisted after implantation, therefore the likelihood of future tumor formation or cell therapy related complications is low. In combination with our other efficacy and safety data in our established ovine MMC model, the safety results in our murine model support initiation of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for patients with MMC using our PMSC-ECM product.&nbsp;

Discrete subaortic stenosis (DSS) is a pediatric cardiac disease in which a fibrous membrane forms below the aortic valve, likely due to altered blood flow patterns. DSS is typically diagnosed and staged using echocardiographic findings, mainly the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) pressure gradient. Though the membrane can be surgically excised, in up to one-third of cases, it recurs. One of the main challenges in managing this condition is identifying who will develop DSS or a recurrence before symptoms appear. Therefore, we aim to define predictive echocardiographic factors in DSS development in order to recognize children at risk for membrane formation and recurrence.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Pre-operative echocardiograms performed between 2012-2019 from patients with DSS and age- and sex-matched controls were analyzed. Parameters measured include demographics, cardiac function, left ventricular volume and geometry, LVOT pressure gradients, valve annulus diameters, and associated flow changes. The measurements were normalized using 50<sup>th</sup> percentile age and sex-matched values for body surface area or 50<sup>th</sup> percentile age-matched reference values. Variability within the data was analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) to identify parameters involved in the development or recurrence of DSS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Echocardiograms from 42 DSS patients, 23 male and 19 female, and 29 controls were analyzed. 18 of the 42 DSS patients (43%) developed a recurrence. On average, patients with recurrence were younger at the time of surgery compared to those without recurrence (4.9 years vs 8.0 years, p&lt;0.05). PCA was conducted using 12 echocardiographic and demographic parameters. Principal components (PCs) 1 and 2 accounted for 31.4 and 26.5% of the variability in the samples, respectively. As seen in the figure, the control and patient samples clustered separately along PC2, defined by variability in the LVOT pressure gradient, minimum LVOT diameter, and aortic insufficiency. All patient samples showed low variability in PC2, but non-recurrent and recurrent samples separated in PC1 due to variability in left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, and valve annulus diameters.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Variability in echocardiographic parameters successfully separated patients who develop DSS from healthy controls, and non-recurrent from recurrent DSS. The parameters responsible for the variability, including altered geometries and cardiac output, support the role of dysregulated flow patterns in the development of DSS, and ventricular function in its recurrence. These factors, in addition to further clinical and histologic findings, can aid in predicting DSS pathogenesis, allowing for earlier disease identification and appropriate management.

We aimed to develop a LC sensor apparatus that could be applied to a murine model and utilized to differentiate between viable and non-viable tissues in various biologic tissue types. We hypothesized that there would be a significant difference in resonant frequency between both viable and non-viable abdominal and tumor tissues.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The model created consisted of an LC resonant sensor embedded in Tegaderm transparent film. The resonant sensor was connected in series with a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA), which allowed identification of the resonant frequency of the tissue in question (Fig. 1A). Athymic nude mice were injected with patient-derived neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, osteosarcoma, and neuroendocrine cell lines to obtain flank tumors. The resonant sensor was placed on the abdomen or the tumor-bearing area of the flank and the resonant frequency of the tissue was determined three times in each location. The resonant frequency of the tissue was measured on alive, non-anesthetized animals and repeated in the same location five minutes after the mice were euthanized. The data were analyzed with MATLAB MathWorks Software and significance determined at p &lt; 0.05.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The inductor-capacitor resonant sensor model proposed successfully obtained the resonant frequency values of various tissues of athymic nude mice. The resonant frequency obtained for the outside abdomen demonstrated a significant difference between alive and dead abdomen tissue (7.9 x 10<sup>7</sup>&plusmn; 3.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> vs. 3.4 x 10<sup>7</sup>&plusmn; 9.3 x 10<sup>4</sup> Hz, alive vs. dead, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. 1B). The resonant frequency obtained for the alive and dead tumor tissue also demonstrated a significant difference (5.5 x 10<sup>7</sup>&plusmn; 4.7 x 10<sup>5</sup> vs. 9.1 x 10<sup>7</sup>&plusmn; 3.7 x 10<sup>5</sup> Hz, alive vs. dead, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. 1C). &nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A LC resonant sensor was designed for application to a murine model. The LC resonant sensor was applied to the abdomen and to established flank tumors in mice and was able to detect a specific resonant frequency that was significantly different between alive and dead tissue. The resonant sensor developed has potential clinical applications in the real-time identification of viable versus non-viable tissue including, but not limited to, detection of intestinal ischemia and adequacy of tumor biopsy specimens.

Lgr5+ gastrointestinal stem cells are capable of self-organising into 3D organoids resembling the tissue of origin. However, compared to other endodermal epithelial organoids, human gastric epithelial organoids (HGEOs) lack morphological complexity and diversity of differentiated cellular subsets. We examined the ability of HGEO to self-organise into more complex structures by culture in floating extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel rings and through interaction with mesenchymal and endothelial cells.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

ECM hydrogels (decellularized small intestinal mucosa or collagen I) were prepared and tested for cytocompatibility and gelation. HGEO from 11- and 20-week foetuses and 11-year-old patient were expanded in Matrigel, then released and encapsulated in ECM hydrogels.&nbsp; The HGEO-loaded gels were plated in a ring shape (200&micro;L/well) in 24-well plates, and following gelation were detached by forceful addition of culture medium. For co-culture experiments, human fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were encapsulated in the ECM hydrogel with HGEOs and plated in the same fashion.&nbsp; The rings were maintained in floating culture for 13 days, following which some &shy;rings were implanted in immunodeficient mice for 4 weeks. Analysis was performed using immunofluorescence (IF), real time PCR (RT-PCR), and micro-computed tomography (microCT).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

By Day 6, each condition showed spontaneous organisation of HGEO into a continuous tube by growth and fusion of adjacent organoids. Formation of the tubes occurred together with contraction of the hydrogel ring. The external surface of the tubes showed smooth and budding areas, and whole-mount confocal imaging demonstrated gland-like structures opening into a continuous lumen. IF and RT-PCR demonstrated mature gastric epithelial cell subtypes including, chief (pepsinogen), enteroendocrine (chromogranin A), and mucus secreting cells (MUC5AC, MUC6). Tubes showed appropriate polarisation with the apical surface of cells orientated towards the common lumen. Tubes also formed when HGEO were co-cultured with fibroblasts and HUVECs, the latter two of which formed a subepithelial lamina propria-like network. The self-organisation into tubes was associated with nuclear translocation of YAP, a transcription factor in the Hippo signalling pathway. Morphology, epithelial polarisation, and differentiated cell subtypes were maintained in the tubes after 4 weeks in vivo and there was evidence of luminal mucus by IF and microCT analysis of explants.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

HGEO self-organise into complex stomach-like tubular structures with a continuous common lumen in floating hydrogel culture. The tubes demonstrate appropriate epithelial polarity and evidence of mature epithelial cell subtypes.&nbsp; These characteristics are preserved following in vivo transplantation. This increase in complexity is associated with activation of the Hippo pathway.

However, outcomes are markedly improved when these cancers are identified early. The use of resonant frequencies is a novel approach that potentially allows early identification of tumor subtype. Every biologic system, including tumors, has a naturally occurring resonant frequency. Through the use of an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonant sensor, this frequency may be detected and identified by applying an outside frequency and measuring the resonance at the peak amplitude. Using this technique, we investigated whether pediatric cancers varying in type and metastatic activity could be characterized specifically by their resonance.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Two approaches were taken using patient-derived xenografts (PDX) in athymic nude mice: (1) hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine, and osteosarcoma tumors were grown in the flank and (2) a metastatic model of a neuroendocrine tumor was established in the abdominal cavity. The abdomens of mice with and without metastatic tumors were scanned using the LC resonant sensor prior to euthanasia. Additionally, a controlled core sample of the tumors was obtained using a trephine needle. The tumor cores were scanned to identify the specific frequencies of each xenograft. Each scan was completed in triplicate. Data were analyzed using MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup>, and frequencies of tumor type and location were compared. Statistical significance was evaluated with ANOVA tests, and data were reported as a mean &plusmn; standard error of the mean.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Resonant sensor scans of the abdomen in animals bearing neuroendocrine tumor metastasis showed resonant frequencies significantly lower than those of animals with a neuroendocrine flank tumor (p&lt;0.001, Fig 1A). Tumor cores obtained from these metastatic PDX tumors also had significantly lower resonant frequencies than cores obtained from the flank PDX (p&lt;0.001, Fig 1B). Significant differences were observed between the resonant frequencies of hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine, and osteosarcoma tumors when both external tumor and tumor core scans were evaluated (Fig 1C, D). Furthermore, all resonant frequencies of each tumor type were relatively clustered in specific frequency ranges (Fig 1E).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;We found significant detectable changes in the resonance of tumors based on their anatomic location and tumor type, indicating resonance may be a useful tool in identifying tumor metastatic activity and assisting differential diagnoses. These findings have important potential clinical applications to facilitate safe, inexpensive, and rapid diagnoses of pediatric cancers and to evaluate the extent of disease.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease that primarily affects premature infants. Micro-RNA (miRNA) have recently been identified to play an important role in a variety of human diseases such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal infections. miRNA 874-5p expression is increased during intestinal ischemia and is associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction and altered tight junction expression (occludin). Other miRNA are also associated with modulating intestinal permeability during inflammatory states (miRNA 155-5p, miRNA 21-5p). However, little work has been done to determine the role that miRNA may play in the pathophysiology of NEC. This study aims to test the hypothesis that miRNA associated with adult intestinal disease are also altered in NEC. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Following IRB approval and parental consent, discarded surgical samples were collected from infants with NEC and control infants undergoing resection for other reasons (ostomy take down, atresia). Total RNA was isolated from the epithelium of surgical samples using Qiagen miRNeasy mini kit. Taqman Advanced miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit was then used to reverse transcribe total RNA into cDNA. The TaqMan Advanced miRNA assays for miRNA 874-3p, 155-5p, 21-5p, 30e-5p were used for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to determine gene expression. The miRNA 16-5p was selected for use as a housekeeping gene. Samples were also processed and stained with immunofluorescence for tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-1, 4, and zonula occludens). Data was analyzed with Student&rsquo;s t-test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Increased expression of miRNA 874-3p in NEC samples vs. controls was seen (p&lt;0.05). miRNA 21-5p was also increased though not significantly compared to control (p=0.88). miRNA 155-5p demonstrated a trend towards lower expression in NEC epithelium compared to controls (p=0.37). Significantly decreased expression of occludin and claudin-4 were found in NEC vs. control samples. No significant differences were noted in zonula occludens or claudin-1 compared with controls.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

miRNA 874 appears to have increased expression in NEC and is associated with altered occludin expression.&nbsp; This represents an interesting biomarker for future study. miRNA represent an exciting new area of research in the field of NEC and may provide a novel therapeutic target in the future.

We previously demonstrated that the expansion of Prominin-1 (Prom1)-expressing hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) is functionally linked to&nbsp; biliary fibrosis in BA and cholestatic injury (Zagory et al. Hepatology 2018; Fenlon et al. Physiologic Reports 2020). We have also previously reported that Fn14, the receptor for TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis) known to play a role in various fibrotic diseases, is upregulated along with Prom1 and Tweak in the murine model of BA. We hypothesized that Fn14 plays an important role in Prom1-mediated fibrogenesis in BA. To test this hypothesis further, we utilized RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of human BA patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;&nbsp;Raw RNA-seq data from liver biopsies of BA infants and controls were collected from the Childhood Liver Disease Research Consortium and processed by Luo et al. (Gastroenterology 2019). This data was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database under accession number GSE122340 and was analyzed using Partek Flow Genomic Analysis software. Differential gene expression was further analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp; Differential gene expression analysis of the RNA-Seq data revealed 3805 differentially expressed genes, comprising 2498 upregulated and 1307 downregulated genes in BA patients compared to controls. &nbsp;PROM1 and FN14 were significantly upregulated in BA infants compared to controls (FDR 2.17E-7, fold change 6.03 and FDR 8.86E-10, fold change 5.98, respectively). GSEA revealed FN14 to be significant in the top enrichment gene sets included epithelial-mesenchymal transition and apoptosis. IPA showed that the most activated upstream regulator was TGFB1, with FN14 as a significant downstream target molecule. Pathway analysis of differential genes expression data demonstrates significant upregulation throughout the TWEAK signaling pathway with predicted activation of endothelial cell proliferation. This is consistent with ductular reactions and HPC proliferation in BA.



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;FN14 is strongly upregulated as is PROM1 in BA infants compared to controls. Given the role of both genes in liver fibrosis and the known co-expression of FN14 in HPC, the functional link between the two is important to clarify.

Breast cancer continues to be the most prevalent cancer affecting women. Several reconstructive options may exist after its oncologic resection. Breast reconstruction can have a lasting impact on many areas of the patient&rsquo;s life, and therefore, a high consideration for patient satisfaction is crucial. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) provide an important tool in the evaluation of different breast reconstruction techniques, and it can aid in shared decision-making between the surgeon and the patient. The aim of this systematic review is to look at various common surgical modalities in breast reconstruction as they relate to patient satisfaction.&nbsp;Thus, this study will provide a deeper insight of a patient&#39;s perspective on the array of reconstruction options.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A PubMed PRISMA search for articles published between 2000 and 2020 was performed. Criteria for inclusion included nipple-sparing or skin-sparing mastectomy with autologous or implant-based reconstruction, level 2 volume displacement (breast mastopexy or reduction designs) or volume replacement oncoplastic surgery, and measurement of patient-reported outcomes using the BREAST-Q or other validated PROMs. Studies that used PROMs that were not validated were excluded. Analysis looked primarily at PROMs and how they compared when looking at level 2 volume displacement oncoplastic surgery, volume replacement oncoplastic surgery, mastectomy with implant construction, and mastectomy with free flap reconstruction.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
After obtaining 254 full text copies, 43 articles were included. There were 8181 patients included (4363 BREAST-Q, 3818 other PROMs). When comparing types of reconstruction, oncoplastic breast surgery had the highest patient reported outcome measures. BREAST-Q scores (Table 1) demonstrated oncoplastic breast surgery was preferred over mastectomy regardless of the type of reconstruction used in all BREAST-Q categories. Specifically, level 2 volume displacement oncoplastic surgery represented the most favorable PROMs results. Mastectomy with autologous reconstruction was preferred over implant-based reconstruction. When using validated PROMs other than BREAST-Q, we note similar patient preferences to those found using the BREAST-Q.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this comprehensive systematic literature review comparing breast reconstructive options, oncoplastic surgery showed highest PROMs when compared to other reconstructive modalities. Furthermore, mastectomy with autologous reconstruction is preferred over implant-based reconstruction. These trends were true when using BREAST-Q in addition to other validated PROMs.

However, considerable gaps in knowledge remain regarding the intersectionality between rurality, race, insurance status, and other aspects of socioeconomic deprivation that contribute in concert to disparities in cancer care delivery.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The study cohort included non-Hispanic women aged 18-64 years old with either private or no insurance coverage and a diagnosis with breast cancer from the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry (2010-2015). Logistic regression models examined the impact on advanced stage (III, IV) and receipt of curative intent surgery (CIS) from race, rurality, insurance, and the Social Deprivation Index (SDI). Models were adjusted for age at diagnosis, diagnosis year, and comorbidities and included two-way interactions among race, rurality, insurance, and SDI. The CIS model was among women with non-metastatic breast cancer and also adjusted for stage.



<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the study population (n=20,530), 13.1% were diagnosed with advanced stage (III, IV), and 97.4% of women with non-metastatic breast cancer (n= 19,709) received curative intent surgery (CIS). 20.8% of women were non-Hispanic Black (NHB), 6.0% were uninsured/self-pay, 19.1% of women resided in rural areas, and 17.4% resided in communities of highest quartile SDI. NHB race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic White [NHW]), residence in rural (vs urban) or high social deprivation (vs lower quartiles) areas, and uninsured/self-pay status (vs private) were associated advanced stage breast cancer (Table). Among women presenting with non-metastatic breast cancer, NHB and uninsured/self-pay women were significantly less likely to receive CIS than NHW and women with private insurance, respectively (Table). Evaluating intersectionality between Black race, residency in a rural or high social deprivation community, and uninsured/self-pay status, there were no statistically significant interactions influencing stage at diagnosis or receipt of curative intent surgery.



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;In a large and heterogeneous population across the state of North Carolina with breast cancer prevalence comparable to the United States at large, uninsured status, non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity, and residency in a rural or high social deprivation community are independently associated with decreased access to and receipt of breast cancer care. However, there was no measured interactions between these factors. Future studies on socioeconomic inequity and systemic racism should account for important geospatial heterogeneity of populations.

Our aim was to evaluate the effects of the COVID19 pandemic on breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment at a safety net community hospital.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Since shelter in place was initiated in our community on March 16, 2020, a retrospective review of patients who received mammograms during March 16 to July 16, 2020 was conducted and compared to a similar cohort of patients from March 16 to July 16, 2019. Patient demographics, BIRADS distribution, cancer diagnosis, and time to treatment (time of biopsy diagnosis to surgery or chemotherapy) were obtained and compared between the 2019 and 2020 cohorts. Outcomes were analyzed for significance using the chi-square and Fisher exact test for categorical variables and t-test analysis for continuous variables.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 1631 patients who received mammograms in 2019 and 807 patients in 2020 with 21 and 14 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who started treatment in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Compared to 2019, less screening mammograms were performed, 491 (60.8%) in 2020 vs 1099 (67.4%) in 2019. Although there was no difference in the number of patients diagnosed with cancer (p=0.99), a higher percentage of patients were clinically detected in 2020 than 2019 (85.7% vs 52.4%, p=0.04). There was no change in time to initial consult (12 vs 17 days, p=0.11). Time to treatment was shorter in the 2020 cohort (28 vs 47 days, p=0.02).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The COVID19 pandemic has exacerbated disparities in breast cancer resulting in a higher rate of clinically detected breast cancer patients at our safety net hospital. Despite sudden constraints of already limited resources, our coordinated efforts led to a decrease in time to treatment for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.&nbsp;Rapid changes in resource allocation, increase in telehealth use, and coordination between multidisciplinary teams led to improved treatment times.

Higham<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Carle Foundation Hospital,Urbana, ILLINOIS, USA <sup>2</sup>Univeristy of Illinois College of Medicine,Urbana, ILLINOIS, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;

While subpectoral implant-based reconstruction (IBR) is the mainstay of post-mastectomy reconstruction, prepectoral reconstruction is gaining popularity due to reduced postoperative pain, animation deformity and muscle spasms, plus increased aesthetic outcomes and patient satisfaction.

Most studies comparing subpectoral and prepectoral reconstruction have centered on cosmetic outcomes and patient satisfaction. Few have compared post-surgical outcomes, taking into account oncologic treatments like chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT). The goal of this study was to determine if type of IBR affected clinical outcomes.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Our retrospective analysis included 197 females with breast cancer who underwent mastectomy and IBR between 2014&ndash;2018 (110 prepectoral, 87 subpectoral). Primary endpoints were postoperative complications: unexpected return to OR for hematoma or explantation, percutaneous procedures, infections, and contracture. We also evaluated these endpoints for patients undergoing chemotherapy, RT, or history of RT.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 197 patients, characteristics were similar between groups including BMI, smoking status, diabetes, prior breast surgery and/or radiation, clinical stage, grade, and receptor status. Overall complication rate was similar between groups; unexpected return to OR was 14.74%. Of these, 18 had prepectoral and 15 subpectoral IBR. Between groups, a similar number required chemotherapy and/or RT. Regardless of additional therapies, outcomes were comparable (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our research supports that both types of IBR are viable options, regardless of patient history of/need for additional therapies. While continued long-term data collection is necessary, especially in patients with history of RT, undergoing chemotherapy or adjuvant RT, initial data is promising for IBR options in breast cancer patients.

A recent study of breast cancer patients found that financial distress was highest during treatment and remained high after treatment. This study thus aims to characterize the financial burdens experienced by patients and the resources utilized to address them.?


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;All patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at an academic center who were either enrolled in copay assistance or indicated financial concerns on an intake distress screen between 2014 &ndash; 2019 were included. A web-based survey assessing baseline sociodemographic details, financial effects of breast cancer care, supportive resources used, and financial engagement of the medical team was distributed to those meeting criteria. Responses were evaluated with descriptive statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp;?


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The study included 241 patients. Of the 66 patients who responded to the online survey, 77.4% of patients reported financial distress. Patients rated their distress level on a scale (0-10) and reported a median of 5 [IQR =4-8]. A majority of patients had private insurance (72.6%) and indicated having a good or excellent understanding of their insurance plan (87.9%). Nearly one-third of patients reported an average loss of $501-2000 in monthly income (range: $0- &gt;10,000). More than half of patients reported paying $1-500 monthly (range of $1-10,000) in out-of-pocket medical expenses. Patients reported many changes in their finances: 86.0% made changes in their budget, 84.2% used savings, 70.2% cut down on certain expenses, and 3.5% lost their homes. 36.4% of patients stated they never received any financial support or resources. 64.2% of patients did not receive financial advice or resources from their medical team, and of those, 47.6% reported wanting it to be discussed. Additionally, 58.2% of patients reported discussing finances with a social worker, and of those, 68.4% stated they felt like their concerns were addressed.&nbsp;?


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Breast cancer patients encounter significant financial stressors throughout their treatment course, yet many do not receive the counseling needed to address them.

Lee<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of South Florida College Of Medicine,Tampa, FL, USA <sup>2</sup>Moffitt Cancer Center And Research Institute,Breast Oncology,Tampa, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become the standard of care for treating operable, advanced stage breast cancer, and equivalent outcomes have been demonstrated when compared to adjuvant chemotherapy. Use of NAC has also led to increased rates of breast conservation surgery. There are few studies that compare NAC and upfront surgery (SX) for clinically node-negative (cN0), early-stage breast cancer patients. We hypothesized that NAC for patients with T2 cN0 breast cancer does not affect rates of breast conserving surgery or local-regional recurrence (LRR).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single-institution retrospective chart review was conducted for patients with cT2N0 breast cancer between January 2008 and July 2019. Patients were clinically node negative, with histologically confirmed disease. Data was analyzed with descriptive statistics for demographic and disease characteristics as well as with Kaplan-Meier method, log-ranked tests and Cox proportional-hazard tests to compare LRR between NAC and SX.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 269 patients, 161 (60%) were treated with NAC while 108 (40%) were treated with SX. All patients had sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The patients treated with NAC were younger (median 50 vs 54 years; p=0.004) and had a slightly larger clinical T size (median 32 vs 31 mm; p=0.14). NAC patients also had a smaller pathological tumor size upon resection (median 3 vs 22 mm; p&lt;0.001). Significantly more NAC patients had hormone unresponsive (p&lt;0.001) and Her2Neu negative tumors (p&lt;0.001). There was a difference seen in breast conserving surgery, as patients that had a lumpectomy were more likely to be NAC patients (p&lt;0.001). NAC patients were also more likely to undergo SLNB only compared to SLNB followed by an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (p&lt;0.001). There was no significant difference between NAC and surgery for local or distant recurrence. On univariable analysis, there was no difference in LRR between NAC vs SX, node surgery, NAC response, or adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation or hormone therapy use. On multivariable analysis, there was no difference in LRR between NAC and SX (HR=0.3, p=0.08).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:
There was no difference in LRR between clinically T2, N0 breast cancer patients that had NAC or upfront surgery. NAC patients were, however, less likely to undergo ALND, and had a higher rate of breast conservation surgery than SX patients. NAC for early stage breast cancer should be used judiciously.

Parker<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Dept Of Surgery, Division Of Breast And Endocrine Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

The Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CG CAHPS) is a standardized metric by which patients assess their perception of physician care in the ambulatory setting.The survey asks patients to rate their providers on a scale of 0-10 in categories related to physician communication and access to care. A top box score is defined as the percentage of patients who assigned a score of 9 or 10 in each category.&nbsp;

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a major upheaval in the US healthcare system and the way in which physicians provide care to patients. During the early stage of COVID-19, there was a transition to telemedicine to reduce the number of personal contacts. With this change in the way patients are treated, we set out to assess how their perception of quality of care changed with implementation of video and phone visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Top box data for selected surgeons were extracted by visit date from Press Ganey. Months sampled included December 2019-February 2020 (pre-COVID) and April-June 2020 (post-COVID onset). March was excluded due to transition of care related to COVID-19. Surveys were 90%-10% blend of email/ paper, respectively. The survey tool used is a modified ACO CAHPS survey. A paired t-test was conducted to evaluate the difference in arrived appointments prior to and after the onset of COVID-19. An independent samples t-test was conducted to determine if there was a significant difference between physician communication scores, overall doctor rating, and telephone answering after hours before and after the onset of COVID-19.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Prior to the onset of COVID-19 there were 671 in person patient visits. After the onset of COVID-19 there were 560 patient visits. Of those visits, there were 325 in person, 190 phone, and 45 video visits. There&nbsp;was no significant difference in the number of arrived visits before and after the onset of COVID-19 (p = 0.74, 0.15, 0.22). The average pre-COVID physician communication score was 99.2 and the post onset score was 97.4. There was no significant difference in scores between the two groups, t=0.1, p=0.5. The average overall doctor rating (ODR) scores before and after the onset of COVID-19 were 100 and 94.8, respectively. There was no significant difference in ODR scores between the two groups, t=1.0, p= 0.5. The average pre-COVID after hours phone answering score was 100 while the average score post onset was 76.2. There was no significant difference in Answer Phone after Hours scores between the two groups, t=1.0, p=0.5.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The use of telemedicine to provide patient care during COVID-19 did not cause a statistically significant decline in patient&rsquo;s perceptions of communication or overall satisfaction with their providers. As our health care climate continues to evolve, investigations into the effect of virtual care on patient satisfaction could help to further define the role of telemedicine in clinical practice.

Previous research has cited increased risk of metastasis with more medial BC, but recent studies have&nbsp;argued against locational effects.&nbsp;None of these studies specifically analyzed triple negative BC. The impact of location for triple negative BC is of particular interest as their biology is unique from other BC. Based on previous studies of BC lymphatic spread, we hypothesized that location would not be associated with increased RLNM, DM, or increased mortality, and aimed to characterize these outcomes using a large, retrospective single-center database.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Hormone-receptor negative, HER2-neu negative BC patients who underwent surgery (including RLN sampling) at a tertiary-care hospital system from 1995-2017 were prospectively reviewed. Data collection was performed by an experienced team, with frequent auditing of data. BC location was described as lower-inner quadrant (LIQ), lower-outer quadrant (LOQ), upper-inner quadrant (UIQ), upper-outer quadrant (UOQ), or central (C). Demographic and clinicopathologic data were compared between location groups. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to analyze mortality by location. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify associations with RLNM or DM. Significance was established at p&lt;0.05.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 383 patients were identified and analyzed. Patients were older (median age=59.0 years) and evenly split by race (black=44.4%, white=46.7%, other=8.9%). Location was most often UOQ, and least often C (C=7 [1.8%], LIQ=46 [12.0%], LOQ=28 [7.3%], UIQ=86 [22.5%], UOQ=216 [56.4%]). There was no difference in RLNM between groups (RLNM positive %: C=14.3%; LIQ=10.9%; LOQ=10.7%; UIQ=24.4%; UOQ=17.6%; p=0.28), and no difference in DM between groups (DM positive %: C=0.0%; LIQ=19.6%; LOQ=7.1%; UIQ=11.6%; UOQ=8.8%; p=0.27). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no difference in survival between groups (logrank test: p=0.12; median survival not reached by any group at 15 years). By multivariable analyses, no specific BC location was associated with RLNM, while LIQ BC was associated with increased risk of DM (reference group: UOQ; odds ratio=3.23, 95% confidence interval=1.22-8.52; p=0.02); no other locations had significant associations with DM.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There were no consistent differences in RLNM, DM, or survival between BC locations. Though LIQ BC was associated with increased risk of DM on multivariable analysis, the finding was not supoorted by LIQ RLNM and survival analyses.&nbsp;Location does not appear to be a prognostic factor in triple negative BC.

Silberfein<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Surgical Oncology,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;A pathologic diagnosis of a breast radial scar has been associated with surrounding proliferative disease and malignancy and therefore surgical excision has been routinely recommended.&nbsp; The purpose of this study is to quantify the rate of upgrade to malignancy following surgical excision of a core needle biopsy proven radial scar.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;&nbsp;A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained breast surgical database at Ben Taub Hospital was queried for all patients referred to breast surgery clinic with a pathological diagnosis of a radial scar from 2000 to 2019. Exclusion criteria included a history of a BRCA mutation, breast cancer, and concurrent pathological diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or any invasive breast cancer.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Ninety-six women met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 51.5 years, and the majority (64%) were Hispanic. Fifteen lesions were completely excised by core needle biopsy alone and 49 lesions were surgically excised.&nbsp; Following surgical excision, six lesions (12.2%) were upgraded to DCIS. Upgrade to DCIS was not associated with calcifications or architectural distortion on preoperative imaging (p=0.80 and p=0.47, respectively). However, while not reaching statistical significance, the presence of mass on preoperative imaging was two times more prevalent in patients who upgraded to DCIS (83.3% vs. 44.2%; p=0.072). Similarly, the presence of radial scar associated with cellular atypia on core needle biopsy was two times more prevalent in patients who upgraded to DCIS (83.3% vs. 41.9%; p=0.057). With a mean follow-up of 30.6 months, two patients (4%) who did not undergo surgical excision of the radial scar were diagnosed with ipsilateral invasive breast cancer.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Radial scars found on core needle biopsy are associated with malignancy and strong consideration should be given to surgical excision. &nbsp;Special attention should be taken in patients whose radial scars are associated with concurrent cellular atypia or mass on preoperative imaging as these findings might represent a higher risk group of patients. Larger studies are needed to identify imaging and clinical predictors of malignancy on final pathology.&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, there are no randomized controlled studies in men determining optimal surgical axillary management. There are limited case series reporting use of SLNB. We examined trends in surgical axillary management and outcomes of male breast cancer patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using the National Cancer Database, men diagnosed from 2006-16 with clinical T1-4 N0 tumors treated with primary surgery were identified. Categorical variables were compared between SLNB (1-5 nodes examined) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (&ge; 10 nodes) using chi-square methods.&nbsp; Continuous variables were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.&nbsp; Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare survival between the ALND and SLNB groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 2646 males meeting criteria. Use of SLNB alone increased from 65.9% during 2006-11 to 72.8% during 2012-16 (p&lt;.01) (Figure).


For those who underwent ALND from 2006-11 compared with 2012-16, there were no differences in median age, race, treatment facility type, Charlson/Deyo scores, tumor grade, estrogen receptor and HER2 statuses, pathologic T and N stages, and surgical procedures (mastectomy versus partial). Administration of chemotherapy (58.6% vs 56.7%, p=0.5) was not different while administration of radiation (31.1% vs 48.8%, p&lt;0.01) and endocrine therapy (70.2% vs 80.7%, p&lt;0.01) increased for those diagnosed 2012-16. There was no difference in survival between the two timeframes (p=0.42).


For those who underwent SLNB from 2006-11 compared with 2012-16, median age, treatment facility type, Charlson/Deyo scores, estrogen receptor and HER2 statuses, and pathologic N stages were not different. Tumor grade (81.8% grades 2-3 vs 85%, p=0.02) and pathologic T stage (55.6% T2-4 vs. 64.4%, p&lt;0.01) were higher and more patients underwent mastectomy (74.9% vs 79.4%, p=0.02) in the group diagnosed in 2012-16. Administration of radiation (29.7% vs 29.6%, p=0.95) was not different while administration of chemotherapy (35.1% vs 27.2%, p&lt;0.01) decreased and endocrine therapy (72.1% vs 81.3%, p&lt;0.01) increased in the group diagnosed 2012-16. Survival of those diagnosed 2012-16 was worse than those diagnosed 2006-11 (p=0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Use of SLNB alone has increased while ALND use has declined in clinically N0 men with breast cancer. However, patients who underwent SLNB alone in the later time period had worse clinical characteristics and experienced differences in adjuvant therapy. This suggests increased acceptance of the use of SLNB for axillary management. Further analysis is warranted to evaluate methods of axillary staging and the impact on outcomes in males with breast cancer.

The objective of this study is to examine disparities that impact time intervals during the full sequence of care, from diagnosis through the subsequent treatment course.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who presented to a single academic institution from Jan 2017-July 2019 for second opinion of breast imaging, diagnosis, or treatment for a breast-related complaint. Patients (N = 584) with a breast cancer diagnosis who received treatment at this institution were identified using an electronic medical records system (EPIC EMR). Patient demographics and specific timepoints throughout treatment were collected. Student t-test and ANOVA were performed to assess the impact of age, tumor stage, race, median income by zip code, and insurance status on time to management at all stages.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;This study found disparities in breast cancer treatment based on race, income and insurance status. Difference based on income was statistically significant for time from diagnosis to surgery (p&lt;0.001) and initial encounter at the academic institution to surgery (p=0.01). Difference based on race was significant for time from diagnosis to surgery (p&lt;0.001) and initial encounter to surgery (p=0.009). Difference based on insurance status was only significant for time from initial encounter to surgery (p=0.005). Patients in the lowest income quartile (&lt;$46,000/year), of non-white race, or with no insurance/self-pay exhibited the longest time to surgery in each category (Table 1). Time to chemotherapy was only significantly different based on income. Overall, there were no significant differences for time to surgery based on patient age or formal cancer stage.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Time to treatment for second opinion breast cancer patients is significantly impacted by income, race, and insurance. Disparities were more evident in time to surgery than in time to systemic treatment. Delays in management noted in this study are consistent with documented disparities in literature and demonstrate that patients with low incomes, of non-white race, and without insurance have longer times from breast cancer diagnosis and initial encounter to surgery. Interestingly, less disparity in time to treatment existed for initiating chemotherapy as compared to surgery. Based on this study, there is need for further exploration into why these factors lead to delay in treatment. This will allow for implementation of institutional changes, such as increased navigation for particular populations, to address disparities.

While there is some evidence that patients who undergo coordinated surgery are more likely to have complications than patients who undergo breast surgery alone, less is known about outcomes in patients who undergo coordinated versus staged procedures. We sought to evaluate post-operative outcomes in patients who underwent coordinated versus staged gynecologic, breast, and/or plastic surgery procedures.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent breast surgery and staged or coordinated risk-reducing gynecologic surgery between 2014 and 2020. Short term outcomes including readmission, reoperation, surgical site infection, hematoma, seroma, cardiac complication, DVT/PE, and expander/implant removal were compared between patients who had coordinated versus staged procedures. Chi square analyses were used to evaluate differences in post-operative outcomes, sociodemographic information, clinicopathologic factors, and operative characteristics. Independent t-tests were used for continuous variables. All statistics were performed in R and p values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 140 patients included in the study, 125 patients underwent staged breast and gynecologic surgeries, and 15 patients received coordinated breast and gynecologic surgeries. 102 (87.2%) of the staged patients were diagnosed with breast cancer compared to 14 (93.3%) of the coordinated patients (p = 0.78). 70 (56.0%) of the staged patients and 10 (66.7%) of the coordinated patients had a high risk gene mutation (p = 0.61). The two groups had no significant differences in age, BMI, smoking use, family history of breast cancer, or comorbidities. Between staged and coordinated surgeries respectively, there were no significant differences in 30-day post-operative complications (41 vs. 3, p = 0.47), total operating time (395 vs. 329 minutes, p = 0.22), or length of stay (1 vs. 2 days, p = 0.52). Furthermore, patients who elected coordinated surgery had shorter time to adjuvant chemotherapy (29 vs. 39 days, p = 0.02).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients undergoing breast and gynecologic surgery for breast cancer or a high risk gene mutation may consider pursuing a coordinated surgery without compromising post-operative outcomes. The coordinated procedure is associated with quicker time to adjuvant chemotherapy, which may represent a potential improvement in patient outcomes. Further work is needed to classify which patients are the best candidates for coordinated surgery.

COVID-19 has significantly impacted access to healthcare across the U.S. as health systems have been forced to adapt to increasing numbers of infected patients. With the addition of telemedicine visit options, it is unclear how this pandemic has shaped access to breast healthcare appointments. Measures including total number of arrived appointments and new patient appointments within 10 days of scheduling can be used as quality metrics to evaluate patient access to care. The purpose of this study was to characterize patients&rsquo; access to breast health prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing standard quality metrics.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Patient data from our insitution&rsquo;s Breast Health Clinic, including arrived appointments and new appointments within 10 days, was extracted from IDX Systems from December 2019-June 2020. Data from December 2019-February 2020 was classified as pre-COVID-19, while data from April 2020-June 2020 was considered during COVID-19. Data from the month of March was excluded due to clinical transition during that period. The total number of arrived patient appointments was used to evaluate volume, and the number of new patient appointments within 10 days were used to evaluate timeliness of access. The institutional goal for new appointments within 10 days was 80% or greater. Statistical analysis was performed using QI macros.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The total number of arrived appointments decreased in April and May 2020, but returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in June 2020. There was no significant difference in arrived appointments between pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 time periods (p=0.205). The number of telemedicine visits initially increased during the early COVID period, but began to decline in June when in-person visits returned to prior levels. The percentage of new appointments scheduled within 10 days was below 80% (range 38-65%) from November-April but increased to above the 80% goal (84-85%) from May-June 2020, though there was no significant difference between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (p=0.213).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

While it is too early to assess the full impact of COVID-19 on access to breast health, initial increases in telemedicine visits and new appointments scheduled within 10 days may prove to be significant as the pandemic continues. Further evaluation is necessary over the coming months to determine how fluctuations in visit restrictions and COVID-19 cases impact access to breast health.

Silberfein<sup>1</sup>, C. Hsu<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Surgical Oncology,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Approximately 25% of breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) will have a pathologic complete response (pCR). Patients with node-positive breast cancer have traditionally undergone axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), but surgical practices are shifting with many centers offering less extensive surgery to selected patients after NCT. This study aims to quantitate residual axillary lymph node disease after NCT and identify factors predicting an axillary pathologic complete response.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained surgical database identified women who underwent ALND for breast cancer from 2015 to 2020 at Ben Taub Hospital. Only women who presented with clinically positive lymph nodes and received NCT were included. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 150 patients met the study criteria. For the entire cohort, 44% had an axillary pCR at the time of surgery following NCT. This effect was most frequent in patients with triple-negative (60.5%) and HER2+ (68.4%) cancers compared to those with hormone receptor positive, HER2- cancers (17.9%). In a bivariate analysis, HER2+ disease (p = 0.022), triple negative disease (p = 0.01), grade 3 disease at presentation (p = 0.011), increased Ki67 (p = 0.0005), Hispanic race (p = 0.026),BMI of less than 35 (p = 0.009), and age &nbsp;younger than 45 (p=0.002) were all significantly associated&nbsp;with an axillary complete response. Clinical T-stage 0 to 3 and clinical nodal stage were not found to be significantly associated with axillary pCR. Linear regression analysis(Table 1) identified clinical &nbsp;T4 (OR = -0.22, 95%&nbsp; CI: -0.42 - -0.031, p = 0.023), grade 2 disease at presentation (OR = -0.22, 95% CI: -1.11 - -0.012, p = 0.045), HR positive, HER2- disease(OR = -0.26, 95% CI: -0.47 - -0.039, p = 0.015) and age greater than 45 (OR = -0.23, 95% CI: -0.39 - -0.064, p = 0.007) to be negative predictors of an axillary complete response.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node metastases frequently convert to node-negative after NCT, especially those with triple-negative and HER2-postive breast cancers. Clinicopathologic factors related to tumor biology as opposed to extent or volume of disease were predictive of axillary pCR. This data may help guide clinicians in selecting patients for sentinel lymph node biopsy in lieu of axillary lymph node dissection.&nbsp;

Seibel<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>St Agnes Hospital,Surgery/Pathology,Baltimore, MD, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Although there have been multiple studies on the yield of HER2 FISH testing on IHC 2+ equivocal cases, there have been few studies regarding the additional HER2 Testing on IHC 1+ cases since the application of the 2018&nbsp;American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP)&nbsp;guidelines. The purpose of the&nbsp;2018&nbsp;Guidelines helped guide&nbsp;treatment for breast cancer specimens as HER2/Neu receptor + specimens have been known to respond more effectively to Herceptin treatment.&nbsp;According to the updated&nbsp;2018 ASCO/CAP&nbsp;Guidelines, HER2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Testing 3+ cases correlate to a positive HER2 FISH without further studies needed.&nbsp;If the IHC result is 2+, a recount of ISH is recommended having an additional observer, blinded to previous ISH results, count at least 20 cells that include the area of invasion with IHC 2+ staining. This IHC category is deemed equivocal and necessitates the additional FISH Testing. However, IHC 1+ and 0 are diagnosed HER2 negative with comment that the efficacy of HER2 targeted therapy is limited to those small subset of cases that HER2/CEP17 ratio &gt;/= 2.0 and an average HER2 copy number of &lt; 4.0 per cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;

At St Agnes Hospital Ascension,&nbsp;Baltimore, MD, HER2 FISH has continually been tested on IHC 1+ for 2018 and 2019 despite the new recommendations made in 2018 in order to better examine the specimens for the possibility of false negatives. Within SAH testing for 2019, 204 cases underwent Her2 IHC; 164 from SAH and 40 from affiliated Pathology Services.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of the 164 cases, 65%&nbsp;were IHC negative (Score 0/1+), 42 cases&nbsp;were IHC 1+, and 41 cases were IHC 2+. Along with the IHC 2+ specimens, each of the IHC 1+ were sent for HER 2 FISH Testing per SAH Tumor Board agreement, which showed only a single FISH+ case in comparison to IHC2+ cases that showed 21% (9 cases) to be FISH +. This was similar to our 2018 data collected in which of the 38 IHC 1+ cases tested, only one FISH+ case and one FISH equivocal case were detected. This is in comparison to 31 IHC 2+ cases in which 6% were FISH +, 25% equivocal. These findings support a continuation of HER2 Testing for IHC 2+ equivocal cases as yield percentage of positive FISH + 6-20% whereas the yield of HER2 FISH+ for IHC 1+ continues to be as low as 2%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Based on these findings and the&nbsp;2018 ASCO/CAP&nbsp;Guidelines, our research supports a&nbsp;justifiable proposition to discontinue routine FISH testing on all IHC 1+ cases as is currently recommended by 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines. Instead, to specify FISH testing continuation for IHC 1+ Grade 3 tumors as&nbsp;the few FISH + IHC 1+ cases, each were Grade 3 tumors. It is also reasonably supported to continue FISH for&nbsp;IHC 2+ cases deemed equivocal by the guidelines .

An estimated 200,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed yearly in the United States. Little is known about how patients with increased risk of breast cancer choose to partake in risk managing options, whether it be prophylactic mastectomies, risk-reducing medications, or imaging surveillance. We sought to characterize care management longitudinally and evaluate the relationship between various patient factors and the likelihood of choosing a particular risk-reducing behavior.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate all adult female patients who had at least one clinic visit with a surgical provider for discussion of breast cancer risk assessment between January 2017 and July 2020 at an academic center. Patients with prior history of breast cancer were excluded. Relevant sociodemographic and clinical information, level of risk from various calculators, and any imaging and biopsy findings were recorded from the electronic medical record at initial and subsequent clinic visits. The initial risk management option pursued and the amount of time between risk management changes were noted. A piecewise mixed-effects logistic regression was performed to determine associations between patient characteristics and patients pursuing risk-reducing medication or bilateral mastectomies as part of their care management.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The study cohort included 349 patients, of whom 332 (95%) chose to undergo imaging surveillance screening at their initial visit. In characterizing treatment preference over time, the average time for patients to change their risk management strategy from imaging surveillance alone to taking risk-reducing medication was 2.61 years (n=22; SD=3.73). Likewise, the average time for patients to change strategies from imaging surveillance alone to pursuing bilateral mastectomies was 1.99 years (n=11; SD=2.82). We found that patients were more likely to choose risk-reducing options than surveillance imaging alone within the first 3 years of follow-up (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 2.33 [95% Cl, 1.54-3.53], p&lt;.001) and less likely after 3 years of follow-up (aOR, .73 [95% Cl, .17-5.80], p=.027). Compared to those choosing imaging surveillance alone, patients with known gene mutations (aOR, 24.68 [95% Cl, 3.96-153.81], p=.001) and history of high-risk proliferative changes (aOR, 23.64 [95% Cl, 4.63-120.86], p&lt;.001) were more likely to pursue risk-reducing medication or mastectomies as part of their care management.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In a cohort of adult female patients at increased risk for breast cancer, gene mutations and history of high-risk proliferative changes are factors predictive of patients choosing risk-reducing medications or bilateral mastectomies as part of their risk management over imaging surveillance alone. These findings, when paired with patient reported outcome measures, may help engage and guide shared decision-making in risk management.

Huang<sup>1</sup>, C. S. Cortina<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Medical College Of Wisconsin,Surgical Oncology,Milwaukee, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women in the United States. Tumors are usually of ductal or lobular origin; however, several less common variants exist. Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is classified as a mucin-producing, rare variant of invasive lobular carcinoma. Although there is growing data characterizing SRCC of the breast, there are no large series characterizing its long-term prognosis. Using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), we aimed to characterize and analyze the prognostic and survival outcomes of patients with SRCC of the breast.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The American College of Surgeons NCDB was queried from 2004-2016 to identify patients with breast cancer with SRCC histology.&nbsp; Patients excluded were those diagnosed as stage 0 (DCIS), with multiple malignancies, or had incomplete treatment data. Kaplan Meier (KM) survival analysis was performed based on tumor stage.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 324 patients met inclusion criteria. The majority of patients were non-Hispanic, White, and &ge;50 years of age. Nineteen (19) percent of patients were stage I, 26% were stage II, 20% were stage III, and 35% were stage IV. The majority (78%) of patients had estrogen-receptor (ER) positive tumors. Sixty-three (63) percent of patients underwent surgery, of which 30% underwent lumpectomy and 33% underwent mastectomy. Forty (40) percent of patients received radiation therapy, 55% received hormonal therapy, and 50% received chemotherapy.

KM survival analysis revealed significant differences at 5 and 10 years based on stage (p&lt;0.001) (Figure 1). Five- and ten-year survival analysis, respectively, based on stage was 89.7% and 72.8% for stage I, 80.1% and 59.9% for stage II, 68.2% and 48.2% for stage III, and 26.9% and 8.8% for stage IV.&nbsp; Univariate analysis revealed significant differences in treatment (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy) based upon tumor stage (p&lt;0.001). Lower stage patients were more likely to undergo surgery and/or radiation compared to more advanced stages, who received systemic chemotherapy at higher rates compared to those with lower stage disease.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Significant differences in survival exist for SRCC of the breast based upon tumor stage.&nbsp; The majority of tumors are ER positive and treatment differences exist based upon tumor stage with early stage patients more likely to receive surgery and/or radiation therapy, while later stage patients are more likely to receive systemic chemotherapy. This study is the largest cohort of patients with SRCC of the breast examining treatment patterns and survival outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, efficiency and short-term outcomes for aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a rapid deployment aortic valve (RDAVR).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
182 patients underwent RDAVR with the Intuity Elite valve system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) between January 2014 and June 2019 at our institution. A retrospective analysis was performed and univariate and risk adjusted models were used. Primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and new permanent pacemaker (PPM) incidence. We also analyzed the pre- and post-operative gradients, incidence of renal failure, stroke, post-operative bleeding, and the 30-day readmission rate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The Intuity valve was used mostly for primary AVR in concomitant procedures. While 46 patients (25.3%) received primary isolated AVR and 23 patients (12.6%) underwent redo-sternotomy, 113 patients (62.1%) underwent primary AVR with concomitant procedures including coronary artery bypass grafting, mitral valve repair or replacement, ascending aortic replacement, and others (58.4% vs 18.6% vs 14.2% vs 8.8%, respectively). Overall, mean age was 68 &plusmn; 8.3 years and mean BMI was 31.1 &plusmn; 6.6 kg/m2. The mean STS Predicted Risk Score for Mortality was 3.1. All-cause mortality at 30 days for primary and concomitant RDAVR was 2.7% and post-operative pacemaker implantation was 7.8%. The mean pre-operative gradient was 39.8 &plusmn; 15.7 mmHg and the mean post-operative gradient was 10.1 &plusmn; 4.0 mmHg. The median valve size implanted was 23mm (28.6% of all RDAVR). The mean cross-clamp times for primary isolated RDAVR and overall RDAVR were 27.4 &plusmn; 11.2 minutes and 43.0 &plusmn; 16.8 minutes, respectively. With regards to secondary outcomes, the rate of renal failure was 3.8%; stroke, 1.6%; major bleeding, 1.1%; readmission within 30 days, 12.1% (Table 1). There was no incidence of more than trivial paravalvular leak post-operatively.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The Intuity valve system yielded excellent short-term outcomes and is an efficacious adjunct to aortic valve surgery. The hemodynamic results were remarkable and our cohort had a short aortic cross-clamp duration for both primary and more complex concomitant procedures. Further comparison to standard surgical aortic valve replacement with longer term follow-up is needed to assess the durability of the system.

Cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) is an operation performed to reduce sympathetic innervation to the heart in patients with refractory tachyarrhythmias. This operation has been performed using video-assisted thoracoscopy, and the feasibility and safety of a robot-assisted approach has not yet been established. We investigated the short-term outcomes for patients who underwent robot-assisted CSD.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We retrospectively analyzed adult patients who underwent robotic CSD at a single institution over a one year period. The da Vinci Xi robot system was used to remove the sympathetic chain from the inferior portion of the stellate ganglion to the fourth intercostal space. Pre and post-operative arrhythmia management and outcomes were analyzed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

14 patients (13 men) underwent robotic CSD with a median age of 55 (IQR 51-67) years. The median follow-up was 39 (13-72) days.

Indications for surgery included non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, radiation induced, idiopathic; 64%), ischemic cardiomyopathy (21%), and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (7%). All patients were pre-operatively managed on at least one antiarrhythmic medication, with a median of 2.0 (1.3-2.8) medications. 71% of patients were previously treated with a median of 2.5 (2.0-3.0) cardiac ablations. 79% of patients received implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shocks in the year prior to surgery, with a median of 5.5 shocks (2.8-6.3) in the prior year.

All 14 patients underwent robotic bilateral CSD without conversion to VATS or open procedure. Median operative time was 148 (138-164) minutes, with a median hospital stay of 3.0 (3.0-4.8) days. There were no intraoperative complications. One patient experienced post-operative complications, specifically ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation on post-op days (POD) three and five, respectively, requiring transfer to the intensive care unit and treatment with intravenous lidocaine.

Two patients were lost to follow-up. One patient was successfully weaned from all antiarrhythmic medication. The remaining patients were prescribed a median of 2.0 (1.0-2.0) antiarrhythmics. Overall, 79% of patients had a dosage reduced or medication stopped in at least one antiarrhythmic class; 36% had a dosage increased or class added.

One patient experienced compensatory sweating post-operatively. Two patients experienced ICD shocks post-CSD. One patient experienced a shock on POD24. The second patient had ICD shocks on POD154 and POD268. This was the only patient treated with repeat ablation post-CSD. One patient died two months after the operation from pneumonia.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Robot-assisted CSD is a safe adjunctive therapy for the management of recurrent malignant arrhythmias. This technique can potentially reduce the need for ablations, ICD shocks, and reduce anti-arrhythmic medication doses&nbsp;in patients with refractory arrhythmias.

Newer minimally invasive techniques have supplanted laparotomy and thoracotomy for management of hiatal hernias. Limited data exists on outcomes after robotic hiatal hernia repair despite&nbsp;increasing popularity of this approach. We report&nbsp;our high-volume multicenter experience with&nbsp;durable robotic-assisted laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair&nbsp;with gastric fundoplication without mesh.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Utilizing the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database (STS GTSD), a retrospective review of our cases at the two largest tertiary medical centers in our health system carrying a primary diagnosis of a type I-IV hiatal hernia with or without gastric volvulus who underwent a robotic-assisted repair from 2015 through 2019 was conducted.&nbsp;Cases were excluded if mesh was used or approached via thoracotomy or laparoscopy-alone. All five surgeons used a common approach: closure of the hiatus occurred with a combination of V-loc suture and nonabsorbable suture, and either&nbsp;partial or complete fundoplication. Main outcomes included length of stay, readmission rate, and recurrence rate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
216 cases (67% women, average age 60.47years, average BMI 29.34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were identified. &lt;5% of cases were done urgently or emergently. The median operating time was 165 minutes (interquartile range 135.5 &ndash; 215 minutes). There was one open conversion due to inability to reduce a gastric volvulus associated with a chronic hiatal hernia. The average length of stay was 2.89 days. All patients were discharged home alive. The 30-day readmission rate for any reason and reason related to initial operation was 6.94% and 5.09% respectively. Reasons for readmission related to operation included dysphagia requiring EGD (4), abdominal pain and vomiting (4), hernia recurrence (2), facial swelling from subcutaneous air (1), and fever (1). The hernia recurrence rate was 1.29%; all recurrences were managed operatively. One patient required reoperation for a surgical site infection, and another patient required reoperation for a port site hernia. 6.02% of patients had a pneumothorax due to the operation and required a chest tube. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Elective robotic hiatal hernia repair with fundoplication and closure of the hiatus with V-loc and nonabsorbable suture without mesh is safe and effective. The robotic approach has similar operative time, lengths of stay, and complications compared to published data on laparoscopic hiatal hernia repairs. Comparison to a national cohort using the STS GTSD, and longer-term surveillance with comparison to laparoscopic repairs is recommended to help define the ideal candidate for the robotic approach.

Over 135,000 Americans die from lung cancer each year. Complete (R0) surgical resection remains the best option for cure; however, almost half of lung cancers will recur postoperatively. Surgeons rely on imprecise tactile and visual feedback to assess margins intraoperatively, resulting in incomplete resection and recurrence. Improved detection methods are needed to increase long-term survival rates. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of the Akrotome Probe, a cathepsin-targeted quenched fluorescent agent, to distinguish malignant tissue and assess back-table margins.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
After receiving approval from the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board, 6 consecutive patients suspected of having malignant lesions were enrolled. Normal lung tissue and tumor tissue were collected during wedge resection surgery. Healthy and cancerous tissue samples were incubated with saline and a 50 &micro;M solution of Akrotome Probe in DMSO separately for 10 minutes. Fluorescence was detected using a near-infrared (NIR) imaging system. Signal-to-background ratios (SBRs) were assessed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) software. Final diagnosis was confirmed by the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Pathology Department.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Average patient age was 61.5 years (SD=17.48). Three patients had known smoking history. Tumor pathology included adenocarcinomas (n=2), squamous cell carcinomas (n=2), a synovial sarcoma (n=1), and a granuloma (n=1). Common locations were the right upper lobe (n=3), left upper lobe (n=2), and right hilum (n=1). Four of the nodules were PET avid and the average SUV was 12.8 (SD=7.5). The mean SBR was 4.82 (SD=8.192). Excluding the granuloma (TBR = 23.103), the mean SBR was 1.163 (SD=0.552). The average SBR detected through back-table imaging with the Akrotome fluorescent probe was well below the accepted cut-off (2.0).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The Akrotome Probe is not currently amenable for clinical margin detection during pulmonary resection. Further refinement of this technology in animal and clinical trials is needed, potentially targeting different proteases or other proteins more selectively expressed in non-small cell lung cancers.

Benharash<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - Los Angeles,Division Of Cardiac Surgery,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

UNOS heart transplant allocation policies currently prioritize patients requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS). While an existing body of literature has examined outcomes of such patients, large-scale studies on the financial impact of this strategy are lacking. The present study examined national trends in the utilization of tMCS as a bridge to transplantation and its associated financial and clinical outcomes over the past decade.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The 2005-2017 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried to identify adults undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation. The cohort was stratified into Bridged and nBridged based on utilization of tMCS prior to transplantation. The International Classification of Diseases 9/10<sup>th</sup> Revision codes were used to tabulate relevant operative and patient characteristics. Inpatient costs were derived from NIS charges using hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios and inflation adjusted to the 2017 Personal Health Index. Temporal trends were studied using non-parametric tests (NPtrend), while multivariable regression was used to identify independent associations of tMCS utilization with mortality, hospitalization costs,&nbsp;and post-transplant length of stay (PTLOS).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of an estimated 36,347 patients who met study criteria, 8.3% comprised the Bridged group. On average, nBridged patients were older (52.5 vs 51.3 years, p=0.01), but had a similar&nbsp;burden of chronic diseases as measured by the Elixhauser Index (4.5 vs 4.6, p=0.22) and distribution of female sex (25.7 vs 24.4%, p=0.56). Utilization of tMCS significantly increased from 5.5% in 2005 to 9.6% in 2017 (NPtrend&lt;0.001). Over the study period, mortality decreased significantly in the Bridged (19.7 to 8.5%, NPtrend=0.044) but not the nBridged group (4.6 to 4.9%, NPtrend=0.14). While both groups experienced a steady increase in hospitalization costs, this effect was more pronounced in the Bridged compared to the nBridged group ($18,300 vs $8,300 per year). On multivariable analysis, tMCS utilization prior to transplantation did not impact odds of mortality and PTLOS but was linked to increased hospitalization costs (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Temporary mechanical circulatory support was increasingly used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation over the study period. While tMCS status was not associated with altered in-hospital mortality, it was associated with increased resource utilization. Given the increased use of tMCS and its associated financial burden, efforts to optimize and standardize patient selection are imperative to providing value-based healthcare.

Ben Taub Department Of Physical Medicine And Rehabilitation,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect millions of Americans, and are leading causes of death in the United States. Decreased mobility, often measured with 6-minute walk distance, is a key feature in CHF and COPD, and has been often a primary outcome in many clinical trials. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests frailty, defined as decrease in physiological reserve, is prevalent in patients with CHF and COPD. Although frailty is now considered a reversible and manageable condition, evidence on frailty from clinical trials is sparse. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of 12-week cardiopulmonary telerehabilitation on 6-minute walk distance and frailty status in patients with CHF and COPD.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a single arm 12-week open-label uncontrolled prospective study for 13 patients with CHF and COPD (11 men; 65.9 &plusmn; 9.8 years; 32.5 &plusmn; 5.1 kg/m2). For baseline and at week 12, we measured 6-minute walk distance as the primary outcome. As the secondary outcome, we assessed frailty status using the five Fried criteria composed of weight loss, weakness, slowness, exhaustion and low physical activity (Non-frail = meeting no criterion; Pre-frail = meeting one or two criteria; Frail = meeting three or more criteria).
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We found a significant improvement in the primary outcome, 6-minute walk distance, at week 12 (308.31 &plusmn; 79.13 m) compared to baseline (263.32 &plusmn; 70.37 m) (17.1% improvement; p = 0.020; effect size = 0.61, medium effect). For frailty status, at baseline, two patients (15.4% of all patients) were Non-frail; 11 patients (84.6% of all patients) were Pre-frail or Frail. At week 12, the number of Non-frail patients increased from two to five (38.5% of all patients; 150% improvement); the number of Pre-frail or Frail patients decreased from 11 to eight (61.5% of all patients; 27.3% improvement). However, these improvements did not reach a statistically significant level (p = 0.224).
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The 12-week cardiopulmonary telerehabilitation is effective in improving exercise capacity in patients with CHF and COPD. The cardiopulmonary telerehabilitation may also have positive effects on improving frailty status for patients with CHF and COPD.

There is a paucity of data regarding operative approach and associated outcomes following esophageal perforation.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We evaluated patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project [NSQIP] database with the diagnosis of esophageal perforation treated with an operative intervention by the end of hospital day one between 2005-2018. Outcomes including demographic data, type of surgery, length of stay, complications and survival were collected. We compared outcomes in patients who had an esophagectomy (partial or total) versus repair for esophageal perforation. Our primary outcome was morbidity and secondary outcome was mortality.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 175 patients underwent either esophagectomy (N=79, 43%) or repair (N=103, 57%) for esophageal perforation during the study period. The two groups were relatively similar in age, ASA, and pre-op functional status. The esophagectomy group had more females (N=32, 40%) compared to the repair group (N=23, 22%) (p=0.01). In total, 125 patients (68.7%) developed a complication, including bleeding, wound, and respiratory complications. There was no difference in rate of complication between the esophagectomy group (N=59, 74.7%) compared to the repair group (N=66, 64%) (p=0.12). The esophagectomy group trended towards increased risk for readmission (N=8, 10.1%) compared to the repair group (N=4 [3.9%])(p=0.08). In a multivariable model, only the presence of sepsis (2.94, 95% CI 0.147-0.763) was associated with a significant risk of developing a post-operative complication. The 30-day mortality was 7 (3.85%); 1 (1.27%) in the esophagectomy group compared to 6 (5.83) in the repair group (p=0.1).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients who undergo operative intervention for esophageal perforation have a relatively low mortality rate but high morbidity. The presence of sepsis, not type of operative intervention, is associated with the development of post-operative complications.

Endovascular interventions have been attempted, but reports have been anecdotal. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the outcomes of endovascular management of TIF by pooling the existing evidence.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An electronic database search of Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was performed to identify all studies examining endovascular treatment of TIF. Patients greater than 14 years of age who underwent endovascular intervention for TIF were included. 25 studies consisting of 27 patients met the inclusion criteria.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 48.1% (13/27) of patients were male and median age was 39 [IQR 16, 48] years. Tracheostomy was present in 96.3% (26/27) of cases. Most common indications for tracheostomy were respiratory (42.3%, 11/26) and neurologic (38.4%, 10/26). Median duration from tracheostomy to TIF presentation was 2.2 months [0.5, 42.5]. 81.5% (22/27) presented with tracheal hemorrhage. On presentation, 22.8% (6/27) were hemodynamically unstable, including cardiac arrest in 14.8% (4/27). 96.3% (26/27) of cases underwent covered stent placement while one patient (3.8%) had coil embolization. The median stent diameter was 10 mm [9, 12] and the median length 50 mm [30, 58]. 18.5% (5/27) of patients required repeat endovascular procedure for recurrent bleeding, while 11.1% (3/27) required rescue open surgery via sternotomy. 33.3% (9/27) were on postoperative antibiotics and there was one case of postoperative sepsis (3.7%). In-hospital mortality was 18.5% (5/27), while median hospital length of stay was 30 days [16, 47]. Overall mortality was 29.6% (8/27) at the median follow-up time of 5 months [1.2, 11.5]. &nbsp;Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is shown in the figure.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While uncommon, endovascular treatment of TIF may be a feasible alternative to sternotomy. The approach may be useful in those who are unable to undergo surgery or are likely to have adhesions from prior chest operations.

For T4a adenocarcinoma, NCCN guidelines recommend chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy therapy. For T4b adenocarcinoma, recommendations include definitive chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy or a combination of both. The aim of this study was to characterize course of treatment in T4 esophageal adenocarcinoma and assess survival outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The National Cancer Database was queried to identify adult patients (&ge;18 years old) diagnosed with AJCC clinical T4a and T4b N0-3 esophageal adenocarcinoma between 2010 and 2016 (n=1,206). Chi square tests were used to assess differences in the type of treatment received across patient demographics and facility characteristics. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association between T-stage and 1-year and 5-year overall survival.&nbsp; To ensure adequate follow-up time, patients diagnosed in 2016 were excluded from survival analyses

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 1,206 patients with cT4a or cT4b esophageal adenocarcinoma, 502 were T4a and 704 were T4b. There were minimal differences in patient characteristics (e.g. median age, gender, race) across T status; however, T4b patients were more likely to be treated at a community cancer program (12% vs. 7%, p=0.02). Overall, 321 patients received no treatment (26% T4a, 27% T4b), 437 received radiation only (40% T4a, 34% T4b), 125 received chemotherapy only (7% T4a; 13% T4b), and 314 received both radiation and chemotherapy (27% T4a, 26% T4b).&nbsp; Utilization of surgery was low (&lt;2%) in this patient population. Patients who did not undergo any treatment, compared to those who received chemotherapy and/or radiation were more likely to be older (median age: 67yr vs 62yr p&lt;0.05).&nbsp; Among those who had no comorbidities, 76% received some treatment while only 66% with one or more comorbidities received treatment (p&lt;0.05). Overall 1-year survival was 28% (95% CI 25, 31) and 5-year survival was 2% (95% CI 1,4). While T4b patients appeared to have worse overall survival (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00, 1.29), there was no significant difference&nbsp;after patients were stratified by the type of treatment received.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;There appears to be no consistent use of a single treatment regimen among patients with cT4a or cT4b esophageal adenocarcinoma; however, the impact of treatment on mortality appears to be minimal. Interestingly, very few patients with cT4a disease were offered surgery despite NCCN guidelines. Future studies are needed to assess whether specific patient populations may benefit from systemic therapy and/or surgery.

Cardiac contusion (CC) is a dangerous consequence of chest trauma involving sternal fractures (SF), and while often well-tolerated can occasionally cause morbidity and mortality. Unspecific CC symptoms and inconclusive diagnostic algorithms lead to unreliable findings and misdiagnosis. Our aim was to determine a practical and comprehensive algorithm for diagnosing CC in patients with SF.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 268 patients with radiologically confirmed SF admitted to a level 1 trauma center from January 2015 to March 2020. All patients were assessed with various combinations of electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzyme analysis, and echocardiogram (Echo). Abnormal ECG findings were defined as arrythmia, AV block, bundle branch block, or ST segment deviation. Enzymes elevation was defined as Troponin &gt;0.04ng/mL, Creatine Kinase-MB &gt;5.0%, or Brain Natriuretic Peptide &gt;180 pg/mL. Abnormal Echo was defined as wall motion abnormality, intramural hematoma, or intrapericardial hemorrhage. CC was defined by abnormal findings in both ECG and enzymes, or abnormal Echo.

Results

Mean age of the study population was 70.5 y.o., 58.6% of whom were geriatric (&ge;65 y.o). ECG was the most often performed test (n=264 tested) and was abnormal most often (49.6%, n=131), followed by enzymes (n=150 tested) with fewer abnormal tests (34.0%, n=51), and Echo (n=120 tested) with the fewest abnormal tests (22.5%, n=27). Echo is considered the most accurate test for diagnosing CC, however the presence of anterior chest wall trauma can affect the test&rsquo;s precision. Dual-testing with both ECG and enzymes was performed for 149 patients and yielded both tests abnormal in 20.8% (n=32). Combination of both ECG and Echo were performed for 146 patients, with both tests abnormal in 12.3% (n=18). Both enzymes and Echo were performed for 147 patients, with both tests abnormal in 10.2% (n=15).

Triple-testing, with full combination of ECG, enzymes, and Echo, was conducted for 90 patients, and all tests were found to be abnormal in 15.6% (n=14).

The most common diagnostic algorithm in the study included ECG test combined with enzymes analysis supplemented by Echo, and was implemented for 179 patients with SF. Out of these 179 patients, 50 patients (27.9%) were diagnosed with CC [Figure 1]. A notable presence of geriatric patients may have contributed to a greater detection of CC.

Conclusion

Rate of CC in patients with sternal fractures ranged between 10% and 28%, depending on the diagnostic algorithm. ECG or enzyme results alone are likely to overestimate the true CC incidence. Applying combined ECG and enzyme testing together with associated Echo will form the most accurate diagnostic algorithm for cardiac contusions.

Anastomotic leaks are a major post-operative complication after these procedures. Swift detection is key to initiating appropriate management to limit morbidity and mortality. At our institution, in addition to contrast-mediated barium swallow studies, computed tomography (CT) imaging, or upper endoscopy, we routinely use grape juice to detect esophageal leaks in the post-operative setting. We hypothesize that grape juice can provide similar diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to other modalities for leak detection.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective review of all patients who underwent an esophagectomy or repair of esophageal perforations from 2013-2019 by the thoracic surgery service at our institution was performed. Data collected included demographics, treatment strategy, operative findings, imaging results, and grape juice test results. All patients underwent a barium swallow study, CT imaging or upper endoscopy, as well as ingesting purple grape juice on post-operative day 5 or greater. Purple grape juice observed in the tube thoracostomy drainage system was identified as a positive esophageal leak.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Sixty-four patients were included in the study period (25% female, 88% white, median age 62). The majority of patients underwent a partial esophagectomy (69%) that mainly involved the lower esophagus (88%). Treatment of a malignant neoplasm was the primary reason for an esophageal operation (58%).&nbsp; Sixty-one patients had both a barium swallow study and grape juice test, while one and two patients underwent CT imaging and upper endoscopy, respectively. Grape juice test sensitivity and specificity were found to be 80% and 98.3%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 80%, while the negative predictive value was 98.3%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This pilot study demonstrates the effectiveness of using grape juice in detecting esophageal leaks after esophageal operations in patients with tube thoracostomies.&nbsp; Grape juice may be cheaper and potentially less morbid than other studies performed to detect esophageal leaks.&nbsp; Further research is needed to justify the increase use of grape juice in patients who undergo esophageal operations.

To determine the rate,&nbsp; indication&nbsp; and case fatality of open thoracotomy in our country, we reviewed the chest trauma cases managed surgically.

Method

It was a case series of all the patients of thoracic injuries who presented in two tertiary hospitals-University of Port Harcourt and Federal Medical Centre Owerri all in Nigeria&nbsp; for a 5 year period. The demographic data of the patients , the type of chest injury, the mechanism of the chest injury, the clinical diagnoses of the patients , the operative findings, the Injury Severity Score(ISS), the case fatality rate, the complications. The descriptive statistics were analysed and presented in percentage and fraction.

Results

Out of 306 patients with chest truma, 23 patients (7.5%) had thoracotomy.The mean age and standard Deviation&nbsp; were 31.2(SD+ 13.10) years, the male to female ratio of 7:1.The causes of chest trauma were Gunshot injury 12(52.2%) patients, motor vehicular accident 5(21.7%) patients, stab injury 5 (21.7%) patients, fall 1(4.4%) patient. Diagnosis was made by assessing the quantity and quality of the output of&nbsp; inserted&nbsp; chest tube following trauma, evidence of bowel sounds, chest radiograph and chest ultrasound. The Operative findings were, diaphragmatic injury in 13 patients(56.5%), Lung laceration in 4 patients (17.3%),&nbsp; negative in 2 patients(8.7%), Bullet in the pleural space in 2 patients(8.7%),trachea-bronchial injury in 1patient(4.4%)and bleeding internal mammary artery in 1 patients(4.4%).The case fatality rate was in 4(17.4%) patients.

Conclusion

Massive haemothorax still remains the commonest reason for thoracotomy following chests trauma with diaphragmatic injury the commonest intraoperative finding. There is a need to rule out diaphramatic rupture before the insertion of chest tube for traumatic haemothorax or pneumothorax.

Psychophysiological monitoring of an individual&rsquo;s underlying cognitive state has enabled various performance-assistive interventions in high-risk work domains. Extending this approach to monitor surgical teams offers significant opportunities for system improvement, especially at teaching hospitals. There is also a knowledge gap regarding the potential for cognitive workload to be distributed across individuals in a team that includes trainees. The goal of this preliminary study was to investigate consecutive peaks in cognitive workload across surgical team members in the academic cardiac operating room (COR) and to characterize the primary activity of&nbsp;team members associated with each peak.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Data collection included audio, video, and physiological data capture in the COR during one coronary artery bypass graft procedure. Heart rate variability (HRV) from the attending surgeon, attending anesthesiologist, and primary perfusionist was analyzed by calculating the low frequency-high frequency ratio (an HRV component reflecting cognitive workload states) for every 1-minute interval, and audio/video data were consulted to determine activity analysis during peaks identified in the HRV data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Trainees were present in each of the four COR teams during this case, including an anesthesiologist, surgeon, cardiac nurse, and perfusionist in-training. Based on HRV analysis, we identified three intraoperative instances of consecutive peaks in cognitive workload involving all three team members monitored, including 13 total peaks. Across the 13 individual peaks comprising these segments, the most common activities observed within the corresponding minute in the videos could be characterized by either a deviation from standard practice (4/13, 30.77%), situations involving high temporal demands (4/13, 30.77%), or a combination of these features (2/13, 15.38%). The remaining 3 peaks occurred during standard practice (3/13, 23.08%). Notably, in 62% of the cases identified, one peak due to these factors led to a cascade and subsequent peaks observed in other team members within the subsequent five minutes.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
As a teaching hospital, intraoperative teaching activities are not considered deviations from standard practice. However, in the case we analyzed, unanticipated educational frustrations were often attributed to interactions with trainees (e.g. incorrect instrument use or instrument delivery by the cardiac nurse in-training). While these deviations did not result in medical errors in the case observed, cognitive factors are known to contribute to preventable errors, as noted in recent literature. This observation underscores the necessity to detect and mitigate elevations in cognitive workload related to teaching activities. This analysis additionally suggests the effect of distributed cognition across team members over time, supporting the potential utility in recognition and management of high workload states.

Dabal<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA <sup>2</sup>New York University School Of Medicine,Hansjrg Wyss Department Of Plastic Surgery,New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Citation count and impact factor have been the measures by which the quality of academic literature is evaluated. Novel bibliometrics such as Altmetric are used to quantify the digital impact of academic literature not accounted for by traditional bibliometrics. The objective of this article was to identify any correlations between Altmetric scores and traditional bibliometrics within the cardiothoracic surgery literature.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Citation count, impact factor, and Altmetric scores were collected for the 20 most-cited articles from the 10 cardiothoracic surgery journals with the highest impact factor for 2013 and 2016. The presence and creation date for Twitter accounts associated with these 10 journals were recorded. These data were analyzed using Pearson&rsquo;s correlation testing.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 400 articles were analyzed in total. Within the 2013 cohort, there was no significant correlation between Altmetric score and citation counts (r=0.064, p=0.365) or impact factor (r=0.122, p=0.085). Within the 2016 cohort there was a significant positive correlation between Altmetric score and both citations count (r=0.290, p&lt;0.001) and impact factor (r=0.151, p=0.033). The 2016 cumulative Altmetric score decreased from the 2013 total. Nine of the 10 journals have Twitter accounts, none of which were founded prior to 2014.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The relationship between Altmetric score and traditional bibliometrics will continue to evolve in the field of cardiothoracic surgery. At this time, Altmetric score should not replace traditional bibliometrics, but rather should be an adjunct to these measures within the field. Substantial opportunity exists within cardiothoracic surgery for the utilization of social media for research promotion.

We sought to conduct a meta-analysis to compare the perioperative outcomes by sex in patients with type A aortic dissection who received surgical treatment.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed and MEDLINE for studies published after 2000 reporting sex-based differences in perioperative outcomes among patients with type A aortic dissection. Studies that included type B dissection or that did not stratify preoperative characteristics and perioperative outcomes by sex were excluded. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes included postoperative stroke, postoperative acute renal failure requiring dialysis, and reoperation for bleeding. Data were aggregated using the random-effects model as pooled risk ratio (RR). Meta-regression was applied to examine potential confounders of primary outcome, including age, DeBakey classification, medical history (e.g., hypertension and diabetes), and clinical presentation (e.g., shock and cardiac tamponade).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Seven out 207 studies were included for final analysis, comprising 2210 females and 3726 males. Compared with male sex, female sex was associated with comparable 30-day mortality (RR, 1.04; 95%CI: 0.89-1.22; Figure 1), postoperative stroke risk (RR, 1.00; 95%CI: 0.81-1.24), and postoperative risk of acute renal failure (RR, 0.71; 95%CI: 0.44-1.15). However, we observed a significantly decreased risk of reoperation for bleeding (RR, 0.31, 95%CI: 0.24-0.39) in females when compared to males. No important confounders were identified in the meta-regression analysis.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Among patients treated surgically for acute type A aortic dissection, female sex is not associated with significantly increased risk of 30-day mortality or major postoperative complications, but is associated with a significantly decreased risk of postoperative bleeding requiring reoperation.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare neuroendocrine malignancy, for which the only potentially curative treatment is surgery, however for Stage III and IV (advanced) disease it is often not possible to achieve complete resection. Recently the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has shown promise in the metastatic setting. Here we sought to evaluate surgical outcomes and overall survival for Stage III/IV patients treated by surgery and the impact of TKIs for these patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A prospectively collected surgical database was used to select patients with a diagnosis of MTC, treated by total thyroidectomy between 1986-2020. Survival analysis was performed from the stage at surgery and TKI use using the log-rank test. The primary outcome was overall survival reported as 5- or 10-year survival with 95% confidence intervals. Patients with less than 12 months of follow up were excluded.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Over a median follow up of 6 years (range 0.1-40), 197 patients had surgery for MTC, 96 of which were stage III-IV, six patients were excluded due to inadequate follow-up. The 90 patients included had a median age of 50 years (range 10-85), 60% were male and 15% had familial disease. The median primary tumour size was 24 mm with 15% of patients stage III, 68% IVa, 1% IVb and 16% stage IVc.

For initial surgery, 64% underwent a therapeutic lymph node dissection at the time of surgery where 14% had invasion of their recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) requiring sacrifice, 5% sustained a temporary RLN injury and 9% had temporary hypoparathyroidism. During follow up, 30% of patients were subsequently started on a TKI, the most common agent being Selpercatinib (LOXO-292) in 11% and 43% developed recurrent disease requiring re-operation.

During follow-up, 28% died, with a median survival of 19 years (range 0.1-27.4) and 10-year survival of 73.0% (60.0-82.2%). Most patients regardless of stage achieved long-term survival, and there was no significant difference in 5-year survival between stage III 91.7% (53.8-98.6%) stage IV disease 83.6% (72.1-90.5%, P=0.8), however as expected stage IVc MTC was associated with worse outcomes (P=0.01, Fig. 1a). There was no significant difference in overall survival for the use of TKIs, except for patients with stage IVc MTC (P&lt;0.01, Fig. 1b).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this large series of advanced MTC patients, patients selected for surgery can achieve long term survival regardless of stage which supports an aggressive initial surgical approach however many patients require reoperation and there is a substantial rate of operative morbidity. In this unselected series, patients presenting with stage IVc disease have been observed to have a longer survival time with the use of TKIs.

Lew<sup>1</sup>, J. C. Farra<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Miami Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine,Division Of Endocrine Surgery; DeWitt Daughtry Family Department Of Surgery,Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many medical providers have turned to telemedicine as an alternative method to provide ambulatory patient care. Proponents of telemedicine advocate the patient convenience, accessibility, reduced potential for disease transmission and reduced healthcare costs. However, perspectives of endocrine surgery patients regarding this mode of healthcare delivery remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the opinions and perspectives of endocrine surgery patients regarding telemedicine.



<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The first 93 adult patients (18 years and older) who had their initial video-conference telemedicine appointment with two endocrine surgeons from May-August 2020 were contacted at the conclusion of their visit. The survey assessed satisfaction with telemedicine, satisfaction with the provider, and whether attire or video background played a role in their perception of the quality of care received using a 5-point Likert scale. Mean and standard deviation were obtained for each survey item, and differences in perspective between new and returning endocrine surgery patients were evaluated. IRB approval was obtained to conduct the study.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Telemedicine endocrine surgery patients (n=93) stated excellent satisfaction with their visit (4.88 out of 5) and their provider (4.90 out of 5). While slightly fewer patients perceived that telemedicine was equivalent to in-person or face-to face clinic visits (4.13 out of 5), patients still recommended to others a telemedicine visit in the future and most agreed that this modality made it easier to obtain healthcare (4.68 out of 5). Overall, attire of the provider did not influence patient opinion in regards to the quality of care they received during the telemedicine visit. Additionally, video background during the telemedicine visit did not influence patients&rsquo; opinions of the care received. Returning patients were more likely to be satisfied with this modality (4.93 vs 4.70, p = 0.02) and perceived that their provider gave them an appropriate amount of time (4.96 vs 4.70, p =0.01) compared to new patients. The responses from both groups were overwhelmingly positive. Both groups showed no attire or background preference.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study shows that telemedicine does not compromise patient satisfaction or healthcare delivery for patients and therefore is a viable clinic option for endocrine surgery practice. Most patients were satisfied with their experience and this modality. However, returning patients are more likely to be satisfied with their provider compared to new patients. In addition, surgeon attire and video background did not influence patients&rsquo; opinion regarding the care they received.

A novel Poisson regression model, which accounts for seven clinical variables, was recently proposed to improve accuracy of THRT. We aimed to compare&nbsp;the accuracy of estimated THRT dose to reach euthyroid and&nbsp;the difference in predicted dose between the Poisson (scheme A) and the weight-based standard (scheme B) in patients following total thyroidectomy for benign disease.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We retrospectively reviewed medical record of patients who underwent total or completion thyroidectomy&nbsp;for benign disease at a single institution between 2011-19. The THRT dose was calculated using both schemes. We compared the difference between calculated THRT and prediction rates for optimal THRT dosing needed to achieve a euthyroid state between dosing schemes. Patients were evaluated for achieving euthyroid state, defined as TSH 0.45-4.5 mIU/L. We also compared dosing error rates (&gt;25 mcg) between schemes. Prediction rates were compared by BMI tertiles to account for the effect of BMI extremes in achieving euthyroid state. The difference in predicted dose between schemes&nbsp;was calculated in both the total sample size and patients that met euthyroid. A measure of agreement, Kappa, was used to estimate agreement between dosing schemes.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 406 patients underwent total thyroidectomy for benign disease, with 184 having sufficient follow up data confirming euthyroid state. Of the 184 patients, 85.9% (n=158) were women, 81% (n=149) were Hispanic, and 56.5% (n=104) were obese with a median BMI of 30.8 kg/m2. Scheme A resulted in a higher, but not statistically significant, accuracy rate (A: 60.3%, n=111 vs. B: 53.8%, n=99; p=0.21). Overdosing errors were lower with Scheme A (A:17.9% vs. B:&nbsp;32.1%; p=0.0025) and less extreme &gt;25 &mu;g&nbsp;(A: 17.9% vs. B: 26.1%; p=0.08). A trend in improved accuracy in patients with a BMI &gt;35 kg/m2 was noted (A:&nbsp;46.9% vs. B:&nbsp;34.4%;&nbsp;p=0.20). The average difference in predicted dose between schemes was an entire dose difference, mean of 16.0 &mu;g and 15.6 &mu;g for the total and euthyroid samples respectively. Furthermore, for the majority of patients the predicted dose did not match between the two dosing schemes for total and euthyroid samples, 76% (n=311) and 76% (n=141) respectively. In patients that achieved euthyroid, agreement between dosing schemes was low to moderate (Kappa=0.360).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Lower rates of&nbsp;overdosing were found for scheme A. No statistically significant differences in predicted&nbsp;THRT&nbsp;dose&nbsp;was&nbsp;observed between schemes. The difference in predicted dose between schemes was on average 15 ug,&nbsp;correlating with an entire dose. The consideration of clinical variables other than weight (scheme A) when determining optimal THRT&nbsp;dosing may be&nbsp;of importance to prevent overdoses, with particular clinical relevance in patients with higher BMIs.

Schneider<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin,General Surgery,Madison, WI, USA <sup>2</sup>Qualitative Health Research Consultants, LLC,Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a vital outcome for thyroid cancer due to low mortality rates, as treatment complications can result in lifelong morbidity.&nbsp;Narrative data, readily available from patient interviews, provide a rich source of HRQOL. Qualitative coding analyzes narrative data, but predictive models cannot utilize qualitative coding in its common forms. This study aims to determine whether qualitative coding can be converted into computable data and used to identify the most important elements for predicting HRQOL in thyroid cancer patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We used a novel dataset from a recently completed randomized prospective trial that pairs semi-structured patient interviews with validated HRQOL surveys (EORTC QLQ-30) taken at five pre-defined time points before and after surgery for thyroid cancer. Interview transcripts were coded using thematic content analysis. Coding was represented by a logical vector for each transcript. To identify important predictors of HRQOL, Lasso regularized regression was used to identify the model with the fewest predictors (sparsest model) while still retaining strong predictive accuracy. Lasso was trained on 80% of the dataset and identified the sparsest model within 1 standard error of minimum deviance across all tested models. It then predicted whether a patient&rsquo;s score fell above the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile for Global-QLQ. Accuracy was tested on the remaining held-out 20% of the data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In total, 100 patients completed 380 interviews. Of 285 possible qualitative codes, each transcript received on average 125. Mean Global-QLQ was 73.68 (SD 19.13). The sparsest model contained 26 predictors, compared to the minimum-deviance model which contained 50. The model predicted held-out data with 76.81% accuracy and identified elements complementary to, but not explicitly included in the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Specifically, codes that positively predicted higher Global-QLQ included attribution of symptoms to life stage or universal experience, development of knowledge, clinician-initiated patient education, cancer survivorship, suggestions of measures to improve patient experience, and discussion of a return to normal. Negative predictors included discussion of previous cancer experiences, treatment interactions, comparison of reality to aspiration, monetary or non-monetary sources of support, mental symptoms including depression and anxiety, and voice-related symptoms.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We demonstrated a novel method for converting qualitative codes into a computable format suitable for predictive modeling. Furthermore, this approach revealed&shy;&shy; important HRQOL not explicitly stated by surveys like the EORTC QLQ-30, which may inform development of new disease specific QOL instruments. Finally, the high predictive accuracy suggests that in the future, narrative data may be used to identify patients at risk for decreased HRQOL and may replace surveys as a measure of these outcomes. &nbsp;

Despite clear guidelines from the Endocrine Society, prior work suggests that most patients meeting PA screening criteria do not undergo screening. We implemented an institutional adrenal incidentaloma quality improvement (QI) program and examined changes in completion of appropriate screening&nbsp;for PA in patients with&nbsp;hypertension and an adrenal incidentaloma.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This quasi-experimental study was conducted in an academic safety-net hospital system. Our QI initiative&nbsp;targeted primary care providers&nbsp;(PCPs) after their&nbsp;patients were&nbsp;found to have an adrenal incidentaloma; the initiative incorporated (1) messages sent via electronic health record, email, and/or hard copy, with follow-up reminders if no action was taken; (2) access to an institutional adrenal incidentaloma workup algorithm; and (3) for a subset of the sample, a standardized radiology report template that specified follow-up needs. Data was collected prospectively from records of all patients found to have a new adrenal incidentaloma from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019, and compared to a historical cohort of adrenal incidentaloma patients diagnosed from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, who received usual care.&nbsp;The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with adrenal incidentaloma and hypertension who were ordered for aldosterone and plasma renin levels to screen for PA. Outcomes were assessed using Fisher&rsquo;s exact test as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regression.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 349 patients with adrenal incidentalomas were identified in the QI cohort and 251 patients were identified in the historical cohort. Hypertension treated with medication was present in 60.5% (211/349) of patients in the QI group and 60.2% (151/251) of patients in the control group. Patients without a PCP within our health system and those with severe comorbid conditions (e.g., end stage cancer) were excluded from further analyses. Among patients in the QI cohort, 22.6% (25/116) were screened for PA, compared to 5.9% (8/135) in the historical cohort (p=0.0003). More patients had follow-up imaging ordered in the QI cohort (31.0% [36/116]) than the historical cohort (18.5% [25/135],&nbsp;p=0.027). The unadjusted odds ratio for completion of PA screening in the QI cohort was 4.18 (95% CI 1.91 &ndash; 10.05). After adjustments for patient insurance status and the setting in which the original imaging was ordered, the adjusted odds ratio for PA screening was 3.80 (95% CI 1.51 &ndash; 10.67).

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients with hypertension and an adrenal incidentaloma discovered after the implementation of a quality improvement initiative had higher odds of PCP-initiated screening for PA. Although the proportion of patients screened tripled after the QI initiative was implemented, screening for PA remains low, and additional work is needed to further improve adherence to recommended guidelines.

While medical treatment of SHPT has considerably evolved over the past two decades to include calcimimetics, parathyroidectomy is typically reserved for refractory cases. However, the association between treatment choice for SHPT and outcomes after kidney transplantation (KT) is not well understood. The primary objectives of our study were to understand the impact of treatment modality for SHPT on post-transplant outcomes and identify patient characteristics that modified these outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Using the SRTR and Medicare claims data, we identified 5,094 adults (age&ge;18) who received treatment for diagnosed SHPT prior to undergoing KT between 2007-2016. We quantified the association between treatment method for SHPT and development of tertiary hyperparathyroidism, delayed graft function, graft failure, and death using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models and assessed whether these outcomes differed by patient characteristics.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 5,094 patients with a diagnosis of SHPT, 4,866 (95.5%) received cinacalcet and 228 (4.5%) underwent parathyroidectomy. Compared to patients treated with cinacalcet, those treated with parathyroidectomy had a lower risk of developing tertiary hyperparathyroidism (aHR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.29-0.82) post-KT. &nbsp;Among patients on maintenance dialysis therapy for &ge;3 years prior to KT (n=3,477, 68.3%), the risk of developing tertiary hyperparathyroidism was reduced by 57% (aHR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.24-0.79, p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.039) compared to those on maintenance dialysis for &lt;3 years. There was no association between treatment of SHPT and post-transplant delayed graft function, graft failure, or death.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Compared to patients treated with cinacalcet, patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for SHPT prior to transplant had lower risk of developing tertiary hyperparathyroidism post-KT, and this risk reduction was greatest among patients who were on maintenance dialysis for &ge;3 years. Therefore, parathyroidectomy should be considered for patients on maintenance dialysis for &ge;3 years while awaiting transplant to reduce the risk of developing tertiary hyperparathyroidism post-KT. &nbsp;

Schneider<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin,School Of Medicine And Public Health, Department Of Surgery, Division Of Endocrine Surgery,Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Up to 30% of thyroid nodules are classified as indeterminate after fine needle aspiration biopsy. These indeterminate thyroid nodules (ITNs) require surgical pathology for definitive diagnosis. Molecular testing provides additional cancer risk stratification but adds expense and invasive testing. The purpose of this study is to utilize a machine learning algorithm to predict malignancy of ITNs using available data from the electronic health record (EHR).
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted a retrospective study using records from two centers: an academic center and a community hospital. Clinical information and notes were obtained from the EHR; ICD-9 codes identified patients with thyroid nodules from 2005 to 2016. We extracted structured data (demographics, TSH values) and unstructured text reports from the EHR. Using a previously reported natural language processing system, we extracted nodule features from text cytology, ultrasound, and pathology reports. Malignancy was defined as cancer greater than one centimeter in size from pathology reports. To predict cancer on pathology, we tested tree-based, rule-based, Bayesian, and ensemble methods for accuracy using 10-fold cross validation. All models were evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and precision and recall scores.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 279 subjects had an ITN on cytology. Of these, 99 (35.5%) were ultimately diagnosed with cancer. For the entire ITN cohort, Random Tree with AdaBoostM1 performed the best, producing an AUROC of 0.985. Subgroup classification for cytological diagnoses yielded the following results (n, AUROC): suspicious for papillary carcinoma (45, 0.951), follicular neoplasm (84, 0.970), Hurthle cell carcinoma (26, 0.648), and follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS) (124, 0.889). Additional model information is shown in Table 1.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Machine learning methods accurately risk stratify ITNs using data gathered from existing, non-invasive, and inexpensive diagnostic tests. Applying a machine learning predictive model with existing data can become a cost-effective alternative to molecular testing. Future studies will prospectively evaluate the performance of this machine learning approach when combined with expert judgement.

Complete surgical resection is the initial treatment of choice for patients with AJCC/ENSAT Stage I-III disease; however some surgical candidates still do not undergo an operation. We sought to determine factors associated with non-operative management of potentially resectable ACC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried from 2004-2016 to identify all patients with a diagnosis of ACC. Patients with metastatic (M1) disease were excluded. Patient, disease, and treatment characteristics were compared between patients who underwent surgery (S) and who did not undergo surgery (NS). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with NS. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to assess differences in survival between the S and NS cohorts. The level of statistical significance was set to p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 3,163 patients with ACC were identified, from which 1,093 patients with M1 disease were excluded. Of the remaining 2,070 patients with Stage I-III ACC, 17.5% were NS patients. NS patients were older (60 vs. 54 years, p&lt;0.01) and less likely to receive care at an academic center (63.5% vs. 69.9%, p=0.019) or a center with high surgical volume (&sup3;10 cases during the entire study period, 14.7% vs. 25.6%, p&lt;0.01). Centers in the Southern US had a significantly greater proportion of NS patients (Northeast 18.1%, West 15.9%, Midwest 13.3%, South 24.0%, p&lt;0.01). Clinically, NS patients were more likely to have advanced T stage (T4, 28.4% vs. 15.5%) and N1 disease (3.6% vs. 1.8%, p&lt;0.01). On multivariate regression, factors associated with lower odds of undergoing surgery include older age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.05), T4 disease (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.26-7.10), N1 disease (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.06-5.81), and treatment at a community center (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.51-4.40). Overall survival was significantly poorer for NS patients (50.4 vs 78.4 months, p&lt;0.01). Of the NS patients, 85.9% were not offered surgery, 3.9% had contraindications to surgery, 2.8% declined surgery, 1.4% died prior to surgery, and 6.1% had an unknown cause for not undergoing surgery. 69.9% of NS patients also did not undergo chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. All centers performing &ge;&nbsp;10 cases (&ge;&nbsp;95<sup>th</sup> percentile for case volume) were academic centers, and 91.4% of community centers performed &pound;4 ACC operations throughout the duration of the study.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Non-operative management of potentially resectable ACC was associated with treatment at community or low-volume medical centers. Those not undergoing surgery were often not offered any treatments, demonstrating significant deviation from the standard of care for ACC. Given the complexity of the operation for and overall management of ACC, patients with potentially resectable ACC appear to be optimally served at high-volume centers with multidisciplinary adrenal specialty teams.

We tracked endocrine surgery patients with treatment delays due to COVID-19 to investigate the relationship between physician assigned priority scoring (PAPS), the Medically Necessary, Time Sensitive (MeNTS) scoring system and time to surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients scheduled for endocrine surgery or clinically evaluated during COVID-19 related elective surgery hold at our institution (2/26/20&ndash;5/1/20) were prospectively entered into a quality-assurance database which was automatically updated from the electronic medical record. Patients were classified by diagnosis category and procedure type.&nbsp; PAPS was assigned based on categories of high, moderate, or low risk, consistent with the American College of Surgeons&rsquo; priority system. MeNTS scores were calculated.&nbsp; The primary outcome was time to surgery. Descriptive statistics were performed, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for PAPS and MeNTS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 149 patients included, 68% (n=101) were female with the median age being 60 yo (IQR:43-67). &nbsp;Self-declared race was Caucasian in 77% (n=114), African-American in 16% (n=24), and 7% (n=11) were other or unknown. 153 procedures were planned. 54%(n=81) were thyroid surgeries, 35%(n=53) parathyroid surgeries, 5% (n=9) lymph node dissections, 4% (n=6) adrenalectomies, with 4 miscellaneous procedures. Diagnosis was thyroid disease in 90 subjects (60 subjects had thyroid malignancy or suspicion for malignancy, and 30 subjects had benign thyroid disease), parathyroid disease in 53 subjects, adrenal disease in 6 subjects, and other in 2 subjects. Time to surgery was analyzed by PAPS score.&nbsp; High risk patients (n=13) had a significantly shorter time to surgery at an average of 35 days, compared with mean time to surgery of 61 days in moderate risk patients (n=34), and 79 days in low risk patients (n=59). PAPS score was significantly associated with time to surgery (p=0.01). MeNTS scores were provided for 80 patients and were analyzed by diagnosis.&nbsp; Patients with benign thyroid disease (n=12) had a significantly higher MeNTS score than patients with thyroid disease which was malignant/suspicious for malignancy (n=35)(51.5 vs. 47.3, p=0.014). However, when all diagnostic groups were compared, differences in MeNTS scores were not statistically significant (p=0.09). Higher PAPS correlated well with a time to surgery of &lt;30 days (AUC: 0.72). MeNTS score did not correlate well with time to surgery &lt;30 days (AUC: 0.63).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;PAPS better predicted time to surgery than MeNTS scores. This suggests that PAPS may incorporate more complex components of clinical decision-making which are not captured in the MeNTS score.

At the same time and perhaps related to the new guidelines, there has been a shift to outpatient thyroid surgery. The aim of the current study was to assess physician adherence to these recommendations by identifying and quantifying temporal trends in the rates and indications for thyroid procedures in the inpatient and outpatient settings.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Using the IBM<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;MarketScan<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Commercial database, we identified employer-insured patients in the United States who underwent outpatient and inpatient thyroid surgery from 2007 to 2018. Thyroid surgery was classified as total thyroidectomy (TT), thyroid lobectomy (TL) or a completion thyroidectomy. The surgical indication diagnosis was also determined and classified as either benign or malignant thyroid disease. We compared outpatient and inpatient trends in surgery between benign and malignant thyroid disease before and after the release of the 2015 ATA guidelines.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of&nbsp;220,088&nbsp;patients who underwent&nbsp;thyroid surgery were included in the analysis. Approximately 80% of thyroid lobectomies (TL) were performed in the outpatient setting vs. 70% of total thyroidectomies (TT). Longitudinal analysis showed a statistically significant changepoint for TT proportion occurring in November 2015 following the release of the ATA guidelines in October 2015. The proportion of TT as compared to TL decreased from 80% in September 2015 to 39% by December 2018. For thyroid cancer, there is an increasing trend in performing TL over TT, increasing from 17% in 2015 to 28% by the end of 2018.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The release of the 2015 ATA guidelines was associated with a significant changepoint in the operative and management trends for benign and malignant thyroid disease.

However, at many institutions, surgical clips remain the preferred option to control small-caliber named vessels. We analyzed our institution&rsquo;s clinical outcomes after adopting an electrothermal sealing device-only approach to laparoscopic adrenalectomy.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;An IRB approved, retrospective single-institution analysis of all adrenalectomies (2007-2019, N=420) was conducted. 24 patients were excluded due to incomplete data. Open adrenalectomies (n=38) or laparoscopic procedures converted to open (n= 6) were excluded. No conversions were due to hemorrhage during adrenal vein ligation. Patients with ligation using both clips and electrothermal sealing or where the adrenal vein was spared were excluded (n=27). T-test and Chi-2 analysis were used to compare outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 329 patients were analyzed. 71.4% were performed via retroperitoneoscopic approach (N= 234) and the rest were transabdominal (N=94). The average age was 53 y/o (IQR:44-63y/o) and 58.7% were women. The most common indications for surgery were primary aldosteronism (n=107, 32.5%), pheochromocytoma (n=74, 22.5%), autonomous cortisol secretion (n=60,18.2%), and nonfunctional incidentalomas (n=46, 14.0%). The majority of operations used only the electrothermal sealing system for ligation of the adrenal vein: 92.1% overall and 98.2% of operations after 2012. Median operative time was 60 minutes (IQR:50-90 min). The complication rate was 8.2% with an average Clavien-Dindo score of 1.4, SD:0.69). No complications were hemorrhage. Post-operative complications were more frequent in operations where surgical clips were used (p=.03).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective study of all patients undergoing thyroidectomy from January 2010 to December 2019. Inclusion criteria: PTC histopathology, Bethesda V-VI, size 1-4cm, and absence of clinical evidence of lymph node or distant metastases pre-operatively. Primary outcome was rate of HT before and after ATA15.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 5,408 patients, 339 (6.3%) met the inclusion criteria &ndash; 186 (54.9%) pre-ATA15 (2010-2015) and 153 (45.1%) post-ATA15 (2016-2019). The patient groups were similar; there was no significant difference between age, sex, tumour size, and the proportion with Bethesda VI cytology, compressive symptoms, or thyrotoxicosis. Post-ATA15, there was a significant increase in HT rate from 5.4% to 19.6% (P=0.0001). However, there was no corresponding increase in completion thyroidectomy rate (50.0% versus 27.6%, P=0.2). The proportion managed with prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) fell from 80.5% to 10.8% (P&lt;0.0001). Pre-ATA15, the only factor significantly associated with HT was Bethesda V.

Ultrasounds are the most frequent imaging modality performed for these nodules. Inconsistent and subjective reporting has led to the popularization of standardized ultrasound reporting systems. The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines and the 2017 American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS), have emerged as the most commonly used frameworks to identify both suspicious and low-risk thyroid nodules in a consistent manner. Nonetheless, the utilization of these systems is variable across different healthcare systems and practitioners. This project investigates the implementation of standardized ultrasound reporting systems in a large, publicly funded, provincial healthcare system.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A cross-sectional survey was performed&nbsp;targeting all provincial outpatient radiology facilities&nbsp;to determine the prevalence of standardized reporting for thyroid ultrasounds. The survey outlined various features of the radiology facility including the use of a standardized thyroid reporting system, the year of implementation, previous attempts to standardize, and the barriers to standardization.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 440 radiology facilities surveyed, 169 centers (38.4%) responded. Of these, 127 facilities used a standardized system (75.1%), which included 114 centers using ACR-TIRADS (90%) and 15 centers using ATA (10%). The majority of respondents implemented a standardized reporting system between 2017-2019 (90.6%). Of the 114 radiology facilities currently using ACR-TIRADS, 32 centers (28.1%) updated to this system from the ATA scheme.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Within a publicly funded healthcare system, most centers have only recently adopted a standardized reporting system for thyroid ultrasounds. We found that ACR-TIRADS was preferred both as the first adopted standard framework among radiology facilities, as well as after a period of using the ATA scheme. As clinical thyroidologists perform more thyroid ultrasounds, the implementation of an effective and practical standard tool should be considered, and ACR-TIRADS may be a suitable option.

No intraoperative adjuncts to aid parathyroid identification are in widespread use. We conducted a proof-of-principle clinical trial to assess the efficacy of near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) using indocyanine green (ICG) for localization of parathyroid glands in both anatomic and ectopic positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  After Institutional Review Board approval, five patients undergoing thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy were enrolled. Patients were administered 5 mg ICG intravenously after exposure of the central neck. FGS was performed with a NIR imaging system to confirm presence of parathyroid glands in their normal anatomic position or to aid the search for ectopic glands. Surgical specimens were imaged ex vivo for fluorescence. To quantitate fluorescence, ImageJ software (NIH) was used to generate signal-to-background ratios (SBRs). Fluorescence was measured in arbitrary units&nbsp;based on the number of photons that reached the camera detector. Parathyroid fluorescence was based on the entire gland, with background readings taken from surrounding tissue.&nbsp;Operative success was measured by intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring, and was defined as &ge;50% decrease.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Three male patients and two female patients were enrolled, with an average age of 48.8 years. Three patients underwent thyroidectomy and two patients underwent parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism. In those undergoing thyroidectomy, FGS confirmed in vivo fluorescence in all (9/9) parathyroid glands located by conventional surgical methods (mean SBR: 2.59). In patients undergoing parathyroidectomy, ectopic parathyroid glands were unable to be located by conventional surgical methods. FGS successfully identified a fluorescent parathyroid gland in the thymus in both cases (mean in vivo SBR: 2.25, mean ex vivo SBR: 2.10). Parathyroid adenoma was confirmed by histopathology and IOPTH fell by &gt;50% in both cases. One patient experienced mild asymptomatic hypocalcemia postoperatively but no other complications were observed. There were no adverse effects related to ICG infusion.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: This proof-of-principle clinical trial demonstrated that FGS is an accurate and reproducible method of localizing parathyroid glands in both anatomic and ectopic locations. Parathyroids demonstrated a high fluorescence signal and FGS accurately identified ectopic glands that were missed by conventional surgical methods. This technology shows promise for further clinical use, and is the subject of ongoing trials.

However, due to concerns of access, increased operative times, and cost it has not been widely adopted. The purpose of this study is to analyze the transition from laparoscopic transabdominal (LTA) to robotic transabdominal (RTA) and posterior retroperitoneoscopic (PRA) to robotic posterior retroperitoneoscopic (RPRA) among two high-volume adrenal practices and compare operative parameters using propensity-score matching.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is an IRB-approved, retrospective cross-sectional review of consecutive minimally invasive (MIS) unilateral adrenalectomies performed by two high-volume adrenal surgeons at teaching institutions between 2007-2020. Transitions to robotic technique were analyzed by comparing polynomial regression of operative time and estimated blood loss (EBL) consecutive unilateral MIS adrenalectomies for both surgeons by each approach. Operative times, EBL, hospital length of stay, and complications were compared by operative approach (LTA vs RTA and PRA vs RPRA) before and after propensity-score matching according to patient age, sex, BMI, tumor size, and history of prior abdominal surgery.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 327 patients underwent unilateral MIS adrenalectomy, of which 68% (n=223) were performed by Surgeon A and 32% (n=104) by Surgeon B. In total, 36% were LTA (n=116), 14% were PRA (n=47), 39% were RTA (n=128), and 11% were RPRA (n=36). After propensity-score matching according to patient age, sex, BMI, history of a previous abdominal operation, tumor size, and surgical indication, LTA (n=73) and RTA (n=73) were similar in median operative time (LTA: 120 vs RTA: 111 min, p=0.31), EBL (LTA: 50 vs RTA: 23 mL, p=0.10), LOS (LTA: 2.0 vs RTA: 1.0 days, p=0.23), and complication rate (LTA: 11.0% vs RTA: 9.6%, p=1.00), and PRA (n=20) and RPRA (n=20) were similar in median operative time (PRA: 94.5 vs RPRA: 100 min, p=0.86), EBL (PRA: 15 vs RPRA: 5 mL, p=0.30), LOS (PRA: 1.0 vs RPRA: 1.0 day, p=0.47), and complication rate (PRA: 5.0 vs RPRA 0.0%, p=1.00).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Utilization of robotic approaches for adrenalectomy did not lead to increased operative times or complication rates in two high-volume adrenal practices when compared to laparoscopic approaches. When operative time and EBL were used as a surrogate for surgeon proficiency, there was minimal disruption transitioning from laparoscopic to robotic adrenalectomy, if any at all. Concerns over increased operative times should not dissuade the high-volume adrenal surgeon from utilizing robotic adrenalectomy.&nbsp;

Chen<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Hyperparathyroidism occurs in about 1% of the general population. Previous studies have suggested that the incidence is higher in those patients with thyroid disease who are undergoing thyroid surgery. The study purpose was to examine the incidence of concomitant hyperparathyroidism in patients already undergoing a thyroid procedure and to identify risk factors.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A prospective database of all patients who had thyroidectomy by the endocrine surgery team was reviewed. Per institutional protocol, all patients having thyroid surgery were screened for concomitant hyperparathyroidism. ANOVA/T-Test and Chi-square were conducted to compare those with and without&nbsp;hyperparathyroidism.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The mean age was 43&plusmn;1 and 79% were female. Of the 481 patients undergoing thyroidectomy, 31 (6%) had hyperparathyroidism. The mean pre-operative calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were 9.6&plusmn;0 mg/dL and 67&plusmn;5.2 pg/mL, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;When comparing the groups, patients with concomitant hyperparathyroidism were older (53&plusmn;4 vs. 42&plusmn;1 years, p=0.005). African American race was a significant risk factor for concomitant hyperparathyroidism. While African Americans were only 29% of patients having thyroid surgery, 58% of those with concomitant hyperparathyroidism were African American (p=0.007).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In patients having thyroid surgery, concomitant hyperparathyroidism was present in 6% of the population, higher than the general population. While we understand that PHPT incidence increases with age, to our knowledge, this is the first study to document that African Americans are at a higher risk for concomitant hyperparathyroidism. Thus, we conclude that routine screening for hyperparathyroidism in patients undergoing thyroid surgery is especially in valuable in vulnerable populations, such as the older and African American population.

Individuals living in refugee camps have complex health needs requiring accessible and affordable health systems and political support from the host country. Referral care is an integral component of a functioning health system, yet it is understudied in refugee camp populations. We aimed to assess the pattern of referrals from Nyarugusu Refugee Camp to Kabanga Referral Hospital in western Tanzania.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective review of referrals from Nyarugusu camp to Kabanga Hospital was performed using a paper logbook containing entries between January 2016 to May 2017. Data included status defined as patient or caretaker, age, sex, address, diagnosis, country and reason for referral. Diagnostic data were coded by organ system (e.g. neurological, cardiovascular, infectious disease (ID), musculoskeletal (MSK), neoplastic, etc.) and reasons for referral were coded as either dental, further management, imaging, specialist, or missing. Diagnoses that involved multiple organ systems were assigned up to three codes (e.g. tuberculosis was coded as ID and pulmonary). Reasons for referral coded as specialist were further coded as either surgery, ophthalmology, gynecology, otolaryngology, or orthopedics. Entries were excluded if both the diagnosis and reason for referral fields were missing/illegible or the status indicated was caretaker (not patient).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The mean age of the 427 referrals analyzed was 29.9 and 50.7% of the patients were female. MSK was the most common diagnostic code (n=118, 29.1%) followed by head and neck (n=102, 25.1%) and ID (n=73, 18.0%). Renal was the least common diagnosis code (n=3,&nbsp;0.7%). Imaging was the most common referral code (n=157, 38.0%) followed by specialist (n=145, 35.1%) dental (n=57, 13.8%) and further management (n= 56, 13.6%). Out of the referrals to a specialist, ophthalmology was the most common (n=69, 47.92%) followed by surgery (n=44, 30.56%), otolaryngology (n=16, 11.11%), orthopedics (n=11, 7.64%), and gynecology (n=4, 2.78%). Exhibit 1 displays reasons for referral by diagnostic code.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
These data represent the burden of disease beyond the treatment capacity of the primary care site, the camp hospital. Imaging and specialist care were the primary reasons for referral, and out of specialist care, ophthalmology and surgery referrals are most common. Further research is needed to investigate the epidemiology of surgical referrals in this population, and future implementation science research might focus on purchasing dental and imaging equipment for the camp, which might significantly decrease referrals to secondary care.

In many low and middle-income countries, the relative shortage of surgical subspecialists, defined as non-general surgeons, represents one dimension of low surgical capacity that is poorly understood. The West African College of Surgeons (WACS) accredits training programs in multiple surgical specialties across West Africa, yet little is known about the subspecialist surgical workforce produced in the region. This study aims to quantify the number of WACS subspecialist fellows and to identify underlying factors predicting the number of surgical subspecialists in member countries.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The roster of fellows and list of WACS-accredited training programs was obtained from the WACS organizational website with WACS approval. Countrywide socioeconomic data (GDP, gross population, percent GDP expenditure on healthcare and education) and number of medical schools were obtained from World Bank and World Health Organization data. Statistical analysis was completed in Microsoft Excel using linear regression models to identify predictors of subspecialist surgical workforce.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 4911 total WACS fellows, 477 (10%) were subspecialist surgeons: 225 otolaryngology (4.6% of WACS fellows), 84 orthopedic surgery (1.7%), 64 urology (1.3%), 42 plastic and burn surgery (0.9%), 35 pediatric surgery (0.7%), 17 neurosurgery (0.4%), and 10 cardiac surgery (0.2%). The mean number of subspecialists per country was 28 (&plusmn; 88), with fewer than 10 fellows in 14 (82%) of the 17 WACS member countries. The mean number of WACS-accredited subspecialty surgery training programs per country was 9 (&plusmn; 31), with 13 countries (76%) containing no programs. On univariate analysis, the total number of subspecialists was significantly correlated with countrywide GDP, population, number of medical schools, and number of WACS-accredited subspecialty training programs (Pearson&rsquo;s R coefficients &ge;0.98, p&lt;0.0001), but not with percent GDP spent on healthcare or education (p=0.6). However, on multivariate analysis, only the correlation with the number of training programs remained significant (adjusted R-square 0.997, p&lt;0.005).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The 477 subspecialist surgeons in WACS represent 10% of all fellows, with an average of 28 subspecialists per country. Although WACS member nations have on average 9 subspecialty training programs, many currently lack accredited programs. The number of subspecialty surgical providers in West African countries is significantly correlated with the number of WACS subspecialty training programs. These results suggest that investing in training programs is the most valuable potential strategy to address the shortage of surgical subspecialists in West Africa.

Patients are referred to other public centers or instead utilize private hospitals, which can delay care and increase hospital burden. This study aims to assess workforce, infrastructure, and consumables as they relate to surgical referrals in Chiapas, Mexico.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Surgical capacity data were obtained with an adapted, validated Surgical Assessment Tool in Chiapas. Consistent availability of predictors were defined by hospitals reporting 100% availability at all times. Hospital infrastructure included electricity, running water, autoclave, and oxygen. Surgical workforce included 24-hour availability of a general surgeon, OBGYN, and anesthesiologist. Blood transfusion availability was the ability to provide a transfusion within 2 hours. Surgical volume and number of referrals were acquired from hospital records and clinicians. A referral ratio (RR) was calculated for level 1 and 2 public hospitals and private hospitals. RR was calculated as the number of referrals per 100 procedures. Wilcoxon rank sum was used to compare the median RR between public and private hospitals. Public and private subgroup analyses were performed to further compare RR based on availability of infrastructure, workforce, and transfusion capabilities.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;18 private hospitals and 13 public hospitals were analyzed. Median RR was higher in public hospitals compared to private hospitals (25 vs 2, IQR 5-33 vs 0-12, p=0.048). For all hospitals, median RR was lower in those with consistent infrastructure availability (1.3 vs 25.7, IQR 0-11 vs 5-53, p=0.029) or with a 24-hour workforce (0.28 vs 26.3, IQR 0-10 vs 7-55, p&lt;0.001). Within private hospitals, median RR in those with infrastructure was 1.3 versus 31.3 (IQR 0-9 vs 16-45, p=0.31). Median RR was lower in those with 24-hour workforce (0 vs 21.9, IQR 0-2 vs 8-69, p=0.016). Within public hospitals, median RR in those with infrastructure availability was 15.5 versus 25 (IQR 1-31 vs 5-52, p=0.35). Median RR was lower in those with 24-hour workforce (1.3 vs 26.3, IQR 1-2 vs 15-43, p=0.048)(Figure). There was a non-statistical association between transfusion availability and decrease in referrals.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;These results suggest that limited 24-hour access to surgical workforce or infrastructure is associated with increased surgical referrals in Chiapas. Targeted interventions to increase surgical workforce density and key infrastructure may reduce referral rates and prevent care delays. Fewer referrals can help reduce the burden on higher level hospitals and strengthen Chiapas&rsquo; surgical systems.

The study of gender balance of Surgical, Anesthesia, and Obstetric (SAO) providers is a growing field. Chiapas, Mexico has an SAO density below 20 per 100,000 population, the threshold defined by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery to manage the volume of surgical need. The gender disparity across specialties further compounds the dearth of providers. We characterize the gender makeup of surgical subspecialties in Chiapas across the private and public sectors of healthcare.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A validated surgical assessment tool (SAT) was developed through collaboration with the World Health Organization and the Harvard Program in Global Surgery and Social Change.&nbsp; It was translated into Spanish and used to evaluate surgical capacity in a sample of public hospitals stratified by level and all consenting private hospitals providing cesarean delivery, laparotomy, and/or open fracture repair. Questions exploring surgical workforce and gender were added. Fisher&rsquo;s exact test was used to compare the share of female SAO providers in 19 private and 17 public hospitals and further disaggregated by specialty.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;706 SAO providers were identified via the SAT. Of these,168 (23.8%) were female (Figure). There was a significant difference in the overall percentage of female providers in public and private sector subgroups (20.7% vs 27.4%, p=0.042), however there was no statistical significance between sectors within specialties. There were no specialty groups in which female providers constituted the majority, but of all specialties there were the most women in OB/GYN at 38.6% (73 women of 189 total providers), 39.8% in the public sector and 37.5% in private. The next highest group of female providers was in anesthesia, with 30.6% (75/245) women total. The percentage of female providers in pediatric, general, and orthopedic surgery dropped precipitously, with 12.9% (4/31) female pediatric surgeons, followed by 8.4% (15/179) general surgeons, and 1.6% (1/62) female orthopedic surgeons.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;There are notable disparities in gender across surgery and anesthesia providers in Chiapas, indicative of a need to actively recruit more females to SAO fields. It is imperative to invest in gender equity at the local level, particularly in resource limited settings, in order to meet sustainable development goals, notably SDG 3 and SDG 5. Finally, a gender variable should be included in further SAT assessments to better characterize SAO workforce in areas with low provider density.

Men who have sex with men (MSM) and have HIV are at significantly increased risk of anal cancer. Anal Papanicolau (Pap) cytological testing can be used to screen for anal dysplastic changes. Due to low anal Pap sensitivity, abnormal results should undergo diagnostic workup via high-resolution anoscopy (HRA), with identified dysplasia treated to limit progression to cancer. However, HRA is not available in Colombia. This study describes the limitations of screening for anal cancer in a setting without HRA in order to determine need for a pilot HRA program.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of MSM with HIV who were &ge;18 years of age and received anal cancer screening via anal Pap at a single institution in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia between January 2019 and February 2020. Data from coloproctology follow-up were collected through July 2020. Cytologic results follow the Bethesda System: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion&nbsp;(HSIL). Categorical and continuous variables were compared via Pearson&rsquo;s &chi;<sup>2</sup> statistic and t-test, respectively.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 212 MSM were screened (Figure), and 63 (29.7%) had abnormal cytology results - ASC-US (n=21), LSIL (n=38), and HSIL (n=4). Of the men with abnormal results, 56 (88.9%) were referred to coloproctology, and 49 (77.8%) attended &ge;1 appointments. At initial coloproctology assessment, 17 were referred for anorectal exam under anesthesia (EUA), and 20 for rectosigmoidoscopy by gastroenterology (GI). Those recommended to undergo EUA were more likely to have a visible abnormality on anal exam (p&lt;0.001), had a lower mean CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte (CD4) count (272.8 v. 408.1 cells/ml, p=0.012), and lower nadir CD4 count (186.6 v. 280.1 cells/ml, p=0.040). Specific anal Pap result was not significantly associated with EUA referral. Only 12 (19.0%) of those with abnormal cytology underwent EUA, all of which had resection of visibly abnormal tissue. Mean time from cytology to EUA was 3.9 months.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Lack of HRA in Colombia limits management of abnormal anal cytology results. Those with visible abnormalities, such as condyloma, may undergo EUA with resection, but diagnostic exam with HRA is necessary to localize and treat less obvious dysplastic tissue, even in those with condyloma. Referral to GI for rectosigmoidoscopy, which adds an additional invasive procedure and referral step, and increases loss to follow-up, was done given lack of management options, and could be avoided with access to HRA. Implementation of HRA in Colombia may decrease unnecessary referrals and increase detection of dysplasia for treatment in MSM with HIV.

Chiapas is the poorest state in Mexico and has one of the largest indigenous populations in the country. Greater than 90% of this subset live below the national poverty line, and indigenous communities are largely located in rural areas. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery defines timely access to essential surgery as 2-hour access to a facility providing the Bellwether procedures (cesarean delivery, laparotomy, and open fracture repair). Patients from these communities may have long travel times to reach hospitals, resulting in high non-medical costs. The objective of this study was to compare non-medical out-of-pocket expenditure for surgery at hospitals with either a majority or minority of patients identifying as indigenous.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A cross-sectional study in Chiapas was done in 2019. Data on patient demographics, travel time, and non-medical costs were collected with a validated Surgical Assessment Tool developed jointly by the World Health Organization and the Harvard Program in Global Surgery and Social Change from a stratified sample of public hospitals and all consenting private hospitals. Estimates of patient population and expenditure were obtained from social workers, accountants, and healthcare providers. Costs were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and converted to United States dollars (USD) adjusted by purchasing power parity (PPP).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 37 hospitals, 34 reported sufficient data for inclusion. 17 had patient populations that were at least 50% indigenous, and 17 had patient populations that were less than 50% indigenous. Median expenditure on transportation was $51.20 (IQR 64.45) in hospitals with high indigenous population and $22.10 (IQR 16.17) in hospitals with low indigenous population (p=.03). Median expenditure on other non-medical needs was $32.33 (IQR 32.33) in high indigenous population hospitals and $21.56 (IQR 52.00) in low indigenous population hospitals (p=.96). 25.6% of hospitals with high indigenous populations and 40% of hospitals with low indigenous populations reported that at least 75% of patients in the catchment population could reach the hospital within 2 hours.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While all Mexicans are entitled to free or low-cost healthcare through the government social insurance program, non-medical expenses are higher in hospitals with high indigenous patient volume compared to those with low indigenous patient volume. These patients often travel more than 2 hours to reach a facility with surgical capabilities, and transportation represents a large out of pocket expense. Indigenous patients need better access to surgical care, and financial risk protection should be considered to provide equitable access to surgical care in the state of Chiapas.

Surgical care costs in low and middle-income countries can cause financial devastation for patients. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) in Kenya is a national health insurance scheme that aims to protect beneficiaries from catastrophic health expenditures. There exists few data on the actual cost burdens on patients and local hospitals, particularly within&nbsp;surgical care. We investigated the impact of NHIF on the surgery service at a tertiary hospital in Eldoret, Kenya.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All surgical patients &ge;13 years of age admitted to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) from January 2018 to July 2018 were enrolled in the study. We reviewed medical records and collected information on NHIF enrollment, cost of surgical procedures and total hospital bill, amount covered by NHIF, amount waived by hospital for uninsured patients, and overall net cost to patients. We also collected demographic information regarding patient sex, marital status and category of diagnosis (cancer or trauma). Descriptive analyses were completed with Pearson&rsquo;s Chi-square and two-sample T-test. Costs were converted from Kenya Shillings (KES) to US Dollars (USD) at a rate of 100 KES to 1 USD.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
300 patients were included for analysis. 51% (n=151) were enrolled in NHIF. Being male and married was significantly associated with having NHIF. Trauma or cancer diagnoses did not have significant difference in enrollment rates compared to control. The average total cost for care was significantly higher among those who had NHIF (mean USD 1,496) compared to those who were not insured (mean USD 950) (Table 1). On average, NHIF covered 88% of the total costs of care, and patients with NHIF on average paid only USD 7.5. Among those without NHIF, on average the hospital paid 30% of the cost (mean USD 2,893) while patients were responsible for the remaining (mean USD 3,790). &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Among surgical patients, NHIF was highly effective in protecting patients from catastrophic health expenditures and paid for the majority of care costs. Those without NHIF, which was almost half of our sample, were at high risk for devastating financial cost following receipt of&nbsp;surgical care. Additionally, a high cost burden existed for the hospital,&nbsp;who must often waive a significant proportion of care cost for patients who do not have NHIF and are unable to pay their hospital bills. Significant enrollment differences within gender and marital status amongst surgical patients can help to target future efforts in the expansion of NHIF.&nbsp;

The Lancet Commission of Global Surgery proposed in 2015 that to prevent morbi-mortality and catastrophic expenditures in low- and middle-income countries, basic surgeries to be performed should include: laparotomy, cesarean delivery, and open fracture. In early March 2019, we reopened an operating room that had not been used for more than 4 years at the &ldquo;&Aacute;ngel Albino Corzo&rdquo; Basic Community Hospital (HBCAAC) in the state of Chiapas in Mexico. The procedures performed from March to November 2019 included: cesarean delivery, laparotomy, and hysterectomy, with a total of 110 procedures performed. Before the operating room reopened in March 2018, patients requiring emergency or elective obstetric-gynecological surgery had to be referred to the nearest facility, the Villaflores Hospital, which is a 90-minute drive away.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The objective of our study was to assess the cost for patients and their families when women need to be referred to Villaflores Hospital and to assess the reduction of referrals after the reopening of the HBCAAC operating room in March 2019 and the corresponding economic savings. The HBCAAC databases were searched for referrals made between October 2018 and January 2020, procedures performed from March to November 2019, and the socio-economic assessment of the women undergoing surgery and their families.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 110 procedures were performed: 39 cesarean sections, 66 tubal ligations, 1 cerclage, and 3 hysterectomies in a total of 100 women.

The operating room reopened in March 2019 and ceased to function due to the remodeling by the Ministry of Health in November 2019. Between October 2018 and January 2020, the 8 months with the operating room in operation (M=21.4,&nbsp;SD=4.1) compared to the previous 8 months with the operating room closed (M=27.5,&nbsp;SD=5.1) showed significantly fewer obstetric and gynecological referrals,&nbsp;t(14)=2.7,&nbsp;p=.01.

The cost of referral to Villaflores Hospital by ambulance was $51.6 and the cost of surgical supplies requested was $75, with a total cost of each referral of $126, while the average income per family was $121. Taking into account the estimated number of referrals that were not made due to the reopening of the operating room (n=49), the women who underwent surgery and their families saved a total of $6,174.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We can conclude that the reopening of the operating room has allowed reducing the referrals of women from &Aacute;ngel Albino Corzo to Villaflores, eliminating the economic burden associated with the estimated number of 49 referrals for obstetric and gynecological surgery. The importance of this study is to demonstrate that the provision of accessible, quality surgical services not only prevents morbidity and mortality in women but also has a positive impact on the economy of women and their families.

The World Health Organization&nbsp;recommends layperson first responder training courses to strengthen pre-hospital care. In India, as many as 80% of trauma patients are unable to access safe, appropriate and affordable trauma care within the first hour. Assessments performed in the rural community of Nanakpur, in North India demonstrated a significant paucity of and limited access to trauma and healthcare facilities. In order to address a deficiency in prehospital care, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, India, constructed the Basic Emergency Care Course (BECC) in 2009. In partnership with AIIMS, this study evaluated the efficacy of the AIIMS BECC in Nanakpur through pre- and post- course knowledge assessments testing.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The first responder courses took place in January 2017 in Nanakpur, rural Haryana. A local government physician recruited local community health workers, known as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) as participants. Each 8-hour course included adult and infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation, vehicle extrication, and trauma management. Instruction was mixed methodology using PowerPoint lectures, audio-visuals and mannequin-training. Local physicians led the course and participants completed both a pre- and post-course evaluation to assess participants&rsquo; baseline knowledge and improvement. A signed rank test was used to determine significance of knowledge improvement. Participants then took a one-year post-course assessment to assess knowledge retention. The results were analyzed with a student t-test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The course included 204 individuals. Pre- and post-course test results were available for 70 participants. Participants included 109/204 (53.4%) ASHAs. The majority (n=108/204) passed at least eighth standard in school. Participants demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge (p&lt;0.0001).&nbsp; The one-year knowledge retention assessment was completed by 48.6% (n=53/109) of the original ASHA participants. The comparison between both the pre- and post-course assessment tests with the 12-month retention assessment demonstrated a significant decay in knowledge (p&lt;0.0001).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing AIIMS BECC to train Nanakpur&rsquo;s ASHAs as first responders. Participants demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge based on pre- and post-course test results. However, after one year, there was a significant loss in knowledge, highlighting the need for refresher courses. These data suggest potential for the use of BECC for training ASHAs countrywide in order to strengthen India&rsquo;s pre-hospital care system. Overall, the ASHA system is a constant throughout India and has the potential to be employed to develop pre-hospital capacity.

Limited data exists on the access and types of pediatric surgical procedures performed in the West Bank. The aim of this study is to explore the pediatric surgical conditions treated at Rafidia Hospital in the city of Nablus, West Bank and compare it to the care provided by visiting subspecialized teams.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  After obtaining local IRB approval, we performed a retrospective chart review of the operative log of a district hospital in Nablus between May 1st, 2018, and July 31st, 2018. Data was pulled for all patients &lt;18 years of age. We compared the patient age, surgical volume and complexity of the care provided by local general surgeons to the care provided by a visiting pediatric surgical team during a 1 week educational mission supported by a local NGO. Complexity for this study was defined by the classification of a procedure as &ldquo;major&rdquo; or &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in the operative log.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over the three-month period, 197 pediatric surgical procedures were performed at Rafidia Hospital. &nbsp;One-hundred and seventy-nine of these cases were performed by local surgeons over the course of three months (average of 15 cases/week). Fifteen cases were performed by the visiting pediatric surgeon during the week-long mission trip. Of the total surgeries, 45.4% (n=89) were classified as major procedures while 54.6% (n=107) as minor. The majority of procedures (93.3%) conducted by the visiting surgeons were major procedures. Out of the 179 procedures done by local surgeons, the most common were appendectomies (48/179) and herniotomies (48/179). Meanwhile, the most common procedures done by the visiting surgeons included sistrunk procedures (3/15), laparoscopic cholecystectomies (3/15), and anoplasties (5/15). One third of the procedures completed by the visiting surgical team were revisions of major procedures.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is a steady volume of pediatric surgical services provided by the local surgeons at the district hospital level.&nbsp; The local NGOs have successfully identified and filled a gap in provisions by hosting visiting surgical teams to perform cases that otherwise are not done by the local general surgeons. Further studies need to be completed to further understand pediatric surgical resources available in the region and to build further capacity for pediatric surgical care.

In this study we aim to determine the rate of growth of the Brazilian surgical workforce from 2012 to 2017, compare the rate of growth of the surgical workforce compared to the total physician workforce, and analyze the ratio of surgeons to anesthesiologists to obstetricians.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The total number of physicians, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and obstetricians in Brazil was extracted from the Brazilian Medical Demography, an official report from the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine which collects data on the physician workforce through registration records and provider surveys. We defined SAO density as the totality of all general surgeons, obstetrician/gynecologists, anesthesiologists as well as 14 surgical subspecialists per 100,000 population using Brazilian Census data for each year that physician workforce numbers were available (2012, 2014, and 2017). We then calculated the total percent change, absolute growth, average annual rate of change in physician density and SAO density, and the ratio of surgeons to anesthesiologists to obstetricians.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Between 2012 and 2017, national SAO density increased by 27% from 54.7/100,000 to 69.5/100,000 with an average annual growth rate of 4.8%. In contrast, the growth of the total physician workforce density increased by 9% from 200/100,000 to 217.6/100,000 with an average annual growth rate of 1.7%. The density of surgeons (subspecialists and generalists) increased by 35% from 32.4 to 43.8/100,000, anesthesiologist density increased by 18% from 9.4 to 11.1/100,000, and obstetrician density increased by 13% from 12.9 to 14.7/100,000. Surgeons comprised 59.2% of the SAO workforce in 2012, vs 63.0% in 2017; anesthesiologists comprised 17.2% of the SAO workforce in 2012, vs 15.9% in 2017; and obstetricians comprised 23.6% of the SAO workforce in 2012, vs 21.1% in 2017.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In Brazil, national SAO density is increasing at a higher average annual growth rate than the national physician workforce, while the ratio of surgeons to anesthesiologists to obstetricians has remained relatively constant over this same time period. This suggests that physicians may be becoming more interested in entering surgical specialties despite the emphasis of national policy on primary care strengthening. Further research into the mechanisms of this growth is warranted to inform surgical system strengthening in other nations.

Access to this health service is scarce worldwide, particularly in limited resource settings. The patients&rsquo; journey for surgical management, from the primary care center to the operating room, is underreported in the literature especially in high burden countries, such as Peru. The study aimed to describe the health cares&rsquo; perspective on the referral process for surgical management of patient with MDR-TB in Lima, Peru.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A qualitative study based on focus groups and interviews was conducted to health care providers in charge of the TB program in health centers of northern and eastern Metropolitan Area of Lima. Subjects included general practitioners, nurses, pulmonologists, and thoracic surgeons who participated in semi-structured focus groups and/or interviews. Audio recordings were transcribed by native Spanish speakers. Thematic analysis and referral process reconstruction were performed using DeDoose software.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 12 sessions were recorded (7 interviews and 5 focus groups) which gathered 36 participants. The main themes identified were: 1. Selection criteria for surgery, 2. Administrative process, 3. Inter-institutional communication, 4. Barriers to surgical management of TB. The referral process structure was mapped, and functions were documented (Table 1). Patients&rsquo; evaluations by different provider from different institutions were reported to be challenging due to limited inter-institutional communication, lack of resources and high emotionally demanding for patients and health care workers.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Health care providers involved in the referral process of surgical management of TB in Lima reported limited standardization of selection criteria, a stepwise administrative structure and limited communication between stages of evaluation of the patient. Interinstitutional communication might be an important interventional point to improve a patient&#39;s quality of care during the referral.

Currently, subnational variation in SAO density remains understudied but may represent a useful metric to capture subnational disparities in access to surgical care. In this study, we assess the change in SAO density among Brazilian states between 2012-2017 and determine if SAO density is associated with increases in Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) at the subnational level.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Population and number of SAO in each Brazilian state were extracted from the Brazilian Medical Demography from 2012-2017. We calculated the density of all general surgeons, obstetrician/gynecologists, anesthesiologists, and 14 surgical subspecialties per 100,000 population from 2012 to 2017 at state level using census data for each year. Data on Brazil&#39;s subnational MHDI&nbsp;was obtained from the 2019 MHDI Radar, Atlas of Human Development in Brazil. The association between SAO density and MHDI was compared longitudinally using a linear mixed effects model.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: National SAO density increased by 27% (54.7 per 100,000 in 2012 to 69.5 per 100,000 in 2017). In 2017, SAO density among states ranged from 25.0 to 160.3 with a median of 44. In 2012, 2 states (Maranh&atilde;o, Par&aacute;) did not meet the minimum SAO density target of 20, and 13 states exceeded the target of 40. By 2017, all states met the minimum target and 22 states exceeded the target of 40. Increases in SAO density among states ranged from 12% to 89%. MHDI ranged from 0.63 to&nbsp; 0.2 with a median of 0.7. SAO density was positively correlated with MHDI status over the study period with an estimated increase of 4.7 SAO for each 0.1 increase in MHDI (P&lt;.001)

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: All 27 Brazilan states currently meet the minimum SAO density targets, and 22 exceeded the target recommendation of 40.&nbsp; Given the wide range of SAO densities among states, additional metrics are needed to capture workforce disparities at the subnational level including rural municipalities in need of improved access to surgical care. State-level Municipal Human Development Index is closely tied to increased surgical workforce, suggesting that other economic and social indicators may be useful in identifying subnational disparities in surgical workforce density in low and middle-income countries.

The Delphi consensus method was used to develop such recommendations.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  International surgeon experts from LMICs developed draft statements then participated in two rounds of anonymous voting via Delphi consensus. Only statements with an approval rate of &gt;80% were accepted in the recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of 75 nominated LMIC surgeon experts, 70% (n=53) from 27 countries in four continents (Africa, Asia, and the Americas) representing 13 specialties voted on twenty-seven statements in Round 1 with 22 achieving &gt;80% consensus. After incorporating comments from Round 1, 16 revised statements were relaunched with 15 reaching more than &gt;80% agreement. The final recommendations covered three major themes: 1) whether services should be decentralized or centralized based on three dimensions: surgical volume, acuity, and complexity; 2) how the implementation of these services should be prioritized at the district level; and 3) the role of international surgical partnerships and how they can contribute to improving the overall quality and safety of surgical care in LMICs.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These recommendations currently constitute the best available expert-informed guidelines for policy making, planning, and allocation of resources for health systems strengthening in LMICs.

Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,Pediatric General Surgery,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Burn injuries are the fourth most common type of trauma worldwide, and disproportionately occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). When inhalation injury is present in association with burn injuries, the morbidity and mortality significantly increase. Frequently, management of this injury is resource intensive. The objective of this review is to assess inhalation injury treatment and outcomes in LMICs.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane literature reviews were performed from 1976 through March 2019 for articles published in World Bank-defined LMICs that discussed burn injury treatment and outcomes in LMICs. Two independent reviewers screened articles and a third party reviewer settled inclusion disputes. Full text articles were screened for discussion of inhalation injury treatment and outcomes.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Articles reporting burn treatment and management in LMICs totaled 336 with 50 (14.9%) at least partially discussing inhalation injury in 14 LMICs. Only one article studied inhalation injury exclusively. Inhalation injury prevalence ranged from 0.8% to 97.2% among the included articles. Of the 19 articles reporting diagnostic criteria, 5 used bronchoscopy reliably. Two hospitals cited lack of funding or reliable access to bronchoscopy as a barrier. All but one article found males more likely to develop an inhalation injury. Prevalence of inhalation injury increased with increasing total body surface area of burn (TBSA). Mortality with inhalation injury ranged from 10.4-100% and was found to increase independently of TBSA. Inhalation injury was associated with increased incidence of nosocomial infection (17-36% v. 12%) and multiorgan dysfunction (60.4% v. 39.6%). One study attributed intensive care unit bed availability to the mortality of seven patients. 16 articles mentioned treatment which included: early tracheostomy for 16-100% of patients, prophylactic antibiotics for 100% of patients, and mechanical ventilation for 45-100% of patients. Two articles stratified the severity of inhalation injury in their respective analysis.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Evaluation of inhalation injury associated with burns in LMICs is underreported, and is often only reported in industrial accidents. Inhalation injury in LMICs has an increased association with poor outcomes independent of TBSA. Areas of improvement for inhalation injury include investing in health services infrastructure, standardization of diagnosing, scoring severity, and treatment algorithms.&nbsp;

Cervical cancer, the most common cancer affecting women in The Gambia, accounts for 22% of cancer related deaths across genders. The &ldquo;Strategic Plan for the Prevention and Control of Cervical Cancer in The Gambia: 2016-2020&rdquo; aimed to train more healthcare providers in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions, and expand the number of facilities offering services. We sought to catalog the number of trained providers and available services for management of cervical cancer currently available in The Gambia.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A facility-based survey, developed based on the Surgeons Overseas&rsquo; Personnel, Infrastructure, Procedure, Equipment and Supplies tool, WHO&rsquo;s tool for situation analysis, and expert opinion was conducted in The Gambia Mar 9 - Apr 9, 2020. Publicly owned secondary and tertiary health facilities were surveyed as well as privately owned medical centers and clinics. Local research assistants (RA) were trained to administer the survey, enter data, and obtain GPS coordinates. Facilities were provided with the survey prior to an in person visit by an RA and were allowed to choose the most appropriate person in the facility to complete the survey.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
102 facilities were surveyed: 1 teaching, 7 general, and 4 district hospitals; 3 major, 56 minor, and 31 private medical centers or clinics. 35% of the facilities, and the majority of services, are located in Western 1 Region (WR1), which houses about 25% of The Gambia population. Visual inspection with acetic acid is available at 23 facilities and human papilloma virus testing at 13, 61% and 62% of which are located in WR1 respectively. All facilities offering cervical biopsy (10), cryotherapy (13), thermoablation (1), loop electrosurgical excision (1), and cone knife conization (3) are in WR1. For invasive cancer treatment, 10 facilities offer radical hysterectomy (90% in WR1), 3 chemotherapy (all in WR1), and radiation therapy is not available. Many healthcare providers are trained in services not offered in their facility&nbsp;(Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The majority of cervical cancer services are concentrated in the WR1 region of The Gambia, and 75% of the population is without access to care in their home district. In WR1, comprehensive cervical cancer care (screening, diagnosis, treatment) is available with exception of radiation therapy. Perhaps as a result of expanded training through the &ldquo;Strategic Plan&hellip;,&rdquo; many health care providers are trained in procedures that are not offered at their facility. This presents a unique opportunity for expanding access to care by focusing on infrastructure development in areas that already have trained healthcare workers.

A core set of essential surgical procedures was defined in Disease Control Priorities 3rd edition, Essential Surgery (DCP3), and has been used as a basis to scale up surgical systems in low-resource settings. Here we aim to identify the diagnostic modalities required for safe and appropriate diagnosis and treatment of conditions related to the procedures included in the DCP3&rsquo;s essential surgical package.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We outlined search terms for each of the 44 surgical procedures listed in the DCP3. We entered these search terms in UpToDate to identify and extract all necessary laboratory tests, imaging, and pathology services. For procedures that did not have information on UpToDate, we searched Dynamed. We considered a normal disease course for all procedures and excluded tests for complications or pregnant patients. We included all recommended tests that UpToDate or Dynamed listed. For procedures with multiple diagnoses, the most common diagnosis for the procedure was used. If multiple diagnostic tests were acceptable, in an effort to reduce the number of discrete tests needed, we included the test or modality that was needed for other DCP3 procedures. To indicate what diagnostics are needed for procedures at each hospital level, we grouped the diagnostics based on the DCP3&rsquo;s stratification of surgical procedures into three tiers of care: community facilities/primary health centers, first level health facilities, and second/tertiary level health facilities.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There are 24 unique recommended laboratory tests, seven imaging modalities, and six surgical pathology and cytology tests for the 44 procedures. The diagnostic tests required for each platform are shown in Figure 1, and each subsequent level of care includes the diagnostics required in the level below.&nbsp;

At community level institutions, there are nine recommended procedures that require five laboratory tests and two imaging modalities. At a first level community hospital, there are a total of 37 recommended procedures, which require 22 laboratory tests, five imaging modalities, and four surgical pathology and cytology requirements. The second and third level hospitals require&nbsp; 22 laboratory tests, seven imaging modalities, and six surgical pathology and cytology requirements.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
A broad range of diagnostic testing is required at all hospital levels in order to support the DCP3 essential surgery package. Scale up of surgical care will require significant investment in laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging, and pathology requirements in order to ensure that safe, high quality surgery can be performed at all hospital levels. In this study we created a list of diagnostics required for scaling up essential surgery according to the DCP3.

There is little information about surgical services in Chiapas and even less regarding the impact of service distribution on the indigenous population. The purpose of this study is to understand surgical care delivery among hospitals serving indigenous patients in Chiapas.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We conducted a cross-sectional study in hospitals in Chiapas from September to December 2019 using a validated, translated Surgical Assessment Tool. Data about workforce, surgical volume, and patient demographics were collected. Stratified convenience sampling was utilized to sample hospitals located throughout nine of the ten health districts in the state. Hospitals included both government-funded public hospitals and private hospitals. We compared hospitals that reported either a minority (&lt;?) or majority (&gt;?) of their patient population identifying as indigenous.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 37 sampled hospitals, 17 (46%) reported their patient population as minority indigenous (median bed size 12, IQR 19) and 12 (32%) reported it as majority indigenous (median bed size 16, IQR 26.8). Of minority indigenous hospitals, 17.6% (n=3) had at least one staff member who spoke an indigenous language compared to 91.7% (n=11) of majority indigenous hospitals. In hospitals serving majority indigenous patients, the number of surgical providers and procedures was lower, with a median of 0 general surgeons (IQR 2.5),0.5 obstetricians (IQR 1), and 52.2 monthly operations (IQR 70.3). Conversely, there were a median of 2 general surgeons (IQR 2) and 2 obstetricians (IQR 4) in minority indigenous hospitals, with a median of 68 operations per month (IQR 91).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Translation services are essential in all hospitals in Chiapas to provide equitable high quality care for indigenous populations. Limited surgical workforce in hospitals treating majority indigenous patients may lead to worse surgical outcomes for these patients. Interventions considering the specific needs of indigenous communities and the hospitals they utilize is essential.

Meckel&rsquo;s Diverticulum (MD) is a common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract caused by a persistent vitelline duct. It accounts for half of pediatric gastrointestinal hemorrhages and can cause obstruction, intussusception, and infection. Although the laparoscopic technique has gained popularity, no large scale studies exist comparing open and laparoscopic approaches and conversion rates remain high. We sought to compare postoperative outcomes associated with each approach and to determine risk factors for conversion to an open procedure.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric was used to identify patients who underwent surgical repair of a Meckel&rsquo;s diverticulum from 2012-2018. &nbsp;Outcomes between patients who were treated with a laparoscopic versus open surgery were compared. Chi-square tests and adjusted logistic regression analysis were used to determine significant differences in patient outcomes between treatment groups and factors associated with conversion.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among the 681 patients identified, there were 295 (43.3%) open, 386 (56.7%) laparoscopic, and 119 (30.8%) laparoscopic converted to open patients.&nbsp; Patients undergoing laparoscopic compared to open procedures had shorter length of stay (LOS) (3 vs. 4 days, p&lt;0.001), fewer unplanned intubations (0.0 vs. 2.4%, p=0.003), less bleeding requiring transfusion (3.4 vs. 6.8%, p=0.04) and lower mortality (0.0&nbsp;vs. 1.7%, p=0.015) without significantly different overall complication rates (11.9 vs. 14.9%, p=0.25) or longer mean operative times (77.3 vs. 76.6 minutes, p=0.84). &nbsp;On adjusted logistic regression analysis, only a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists Classification (ASA Class) was predictive of higher overall morbidity rate, not operative technique. Patients requiring conversion to open did not have significantly different morbidity rates (14.3 vs. 10.9, p=0.34), but did have longer operative times (90.1 vs 71.6 minutes, p&lt;0.001) and length of hospital stay (4 vs. 3, p=0.001). They were also more likely to have a history of cardiac risk factors on adjusted logistic regression analysis (Odds ratio 5.5. 95% Confidence Interval 1.1, 27.5, p=0.038).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Laparoscopic MD repair has fewer complications, lower mortality, shorter LOS, with no significant increase in operative time compared to an open approach. Despite a high laparoscopic to open conversion rate, overall morbidity remained low and not significantly different, although LOS and operative time increased.

Hawkins<sup>2</sup>, S. D. Larson<sup>3</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Florida,College Of Medicine,Gainesville, FL, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Florida,Department Of Surgery,Gainesville, FL, USA <sup>3</sup>University Of Florida,Division Of Pediatric Surgery,Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Pediatric burn-related injuries are a common cause of hospitalization and are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. Larger total body surface-area (TBSA) burns are associated with prolonged immunosuppression and increased risk of secondary infection. However, there is little data regarding the consequences of smaller area burns. We hypothesize that smaller burn wounds (&lt;15% TBSA) carry significant risk of immunosuppression and secondary infection in children.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using the DiCorp V6 Burn Database, we performed retrospective analysis of all pediatric patients admitted to our institution from July 2016&ndash;February 2020 with second or third degree burn &lt; 15% TBSA. Baseline data collected included demographic data, burn type, and grafting requirements. Outcome measures include any infection other than burn site, within 30 days of injury.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There were 494 pediatric patients that met inclusion criteria. Seventeen (3.4%) presented to our institution with a non-burn site infection &lt; 30 days. Two (0.4%) patients required hospital admission (herpes simplex virus and a retropharyngeal abscess). &nbsp;The most common infection was upper respiratory infections (URIs)&ndash;present in 11 of 17 children (64.7%). &nbsp;Two (18.2%) patients with a URI, developed advanced complications of their URI (scarlet fever, and retropharyngeal abscess). Other infections included urinary tract infection, conjunctivitis, molluscum contagiosum, impetigo, and diffuse abscesses. The median age for infected children was 1 year old, compared to 3 years old for all studied patients.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Secondary infection following a minor burn is a potential contributor to morbidity among children. While this study is limited by its retrospective nature, the data suggest that children may be in an immunocompromised state after relatively small burns. Scarlet fever and retropharyngeal abscesses are both rare complications of URIs. It is likely that the rate of infection in this population is significantly higher compared to our results, as many patients likely presented to a primary pediatrician outside of our hospital network. Future prospective work is needed to confirm the higher rate of secondary infection in pediatric burn patients and to identify the&nbsp;factors most predictive of this complication.

Islam<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Florida,Pediatric Surgery,Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Biliary dyskinesia (BD) and gastroparesis (GP) are both poorly understood functional disorders involving the foregut that can cause substantial issues in children, with chronic pain and nausea. Both diagnoses have similar presentations and symptoms which may result in confusion, and surgical treatment of either condition frequently results in recurrent problems, which is frustrating to both patients and surgeons. The purpose of this study is to present and discuss patients who had both diagnoses occurring, and to highlight the potential for management.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who had either undergone a cholecystectomy for BD or stimulator placement for GP were included over a 13-year period. Those who had both diagnoses occur in a metachronous or synchronous fashion were selected for further analysis, and clinical variables on their course were collected and analyzed. Descriptive statistics were performed.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp; Of the 26 patients identified, 16 had an initial diagnosis of BD (61.54%) while 10 had that of GP (38.46%). Mean age at initial diagnosis was 15.4 years (+/- 3.58), with 96% being female. Average time between the initial and secondary diagnosis was 471.88 days (+/- 899.42). Mean ejection fraction on CCK-HIDA was 29.8% (+/- 34.6) and 19 patients had symptom reproduction with CCK (73.1%). Gastric Emptying tests were noted to be moderate to severely delayed in 80.8% of cases, with an average half time emptying of 123.11 minutes (+/- 49.26). The etiology of GP was idiopathic in 23/26 cases, with 8 patients having stimulators implanted after a succesful temporary trial. Over half of recurrences were noted within 6 months of either cholecystectomy or placement of gastric electrical stimulator (GES). All patients responded to the secondary intervention and at last follow up (average 706.36 days (+/- 758.04)), had improvement in their overall symptom scores using the gastroparesis index.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Functional foregut disorders (BD and GP) have similar symptoms and recurrence after surgical management occurs. While persistent symptoms may suggest a recurrence in these cases, these data suggest that further evaluation should include testing for the other diagnosis before considering the patient to have failed from their initial intervention (cholecystectomy or gastric stimulator). Substantial and maintained improvement in children can be obtained from the secondary procedure. Patients and families should be educated regarding the potential for secondary diagnoses. Further understanding of these functional disorders is needed in the future to help improve outcomes.

Without quality anesthesia care, there are increased risks during perioperative care, particularly among children. Moreover, the World Health Organization-World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists (WHO-WFSA) has developed standards for global anesthesia care including metrics for capacity, equipment, infrastructure, and workforce. The purposes of this study are to describe anesthesia capacity in Somaliland for children, and to make recommendations for scale-up of pediatric anesthesia care.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Data on pediatric anesthesia capacity were collected using a hospital capacity survey and surgical record review. A&nbsp;total of 15 private, charity, and government hospitals were included. Data included hospital characteristics (location, type, catchment population), workforce (anesthesiologists and anesthetists), infrastructure, and anesthetic equipment. A total of 1,255 children&rsquo;s surgical records were reviewed to collect data on who administered anesthesia and the type of anesthesia given. Of the available data, Somaliland&rsquo;s anesthesia capacity was compared to WHO-WFSA standards.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Overall, Somaliland did not reach most of the target goals for anesthesia capacity defined by the&nbsp;WHO-WFSA,&nbsp;with four indicators lagging by 77% or more. The greatest need was for anesthesiologists, especially pediatric trained anesthesiologists. The majority (85%) of the pediatric surgical procedures used general anesthesia administered exclusively by anesthetists. Compared to rural regions, urban regions have most of the country&rsquo;s anesthesia workforce (52%), infrastructure (55%), and equipment (61%), as well as provide more pediatric surgical procedures (76%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our study found a vast need for anesthesia capacity, workforce, and equipment for children&rsquo;s surgical care across Somaliland. The disparities in anesthesia capacity between urban and rural regions in Somaliland are indicative of complex disparities and barriers to accessing healthcare, as the majority of surgical resources are concentrated in few places. Scale-up of surgical care will require expansion of anesthetic manpower, resources, and infrastructure. Without this necessary scale-up to pediatric anesthesia care, children and their caretakers are unable to seek or receive life changing surgical operations for the children most in need of them.&nbsp;

Bladder opacification on abdominopelvic x-ray series after administration of enteric water-soluble contrast has previously thought to be indicative of a bowel perforation or anastomotic leak. However, more recent animal studies and rare clinical case reports have demonstrated bladder opacification without frank perforation or leak, but rather in the setting of small bowel obstruction or mucosal abnormality. We sought to evaluate our experience with bladder opacification after enteric contrast in children. We investigated clinical factors that might identify patients who would require surgical exploration.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This retrospective IRB-exempt study (3/2010-10/2019) was performed at a pediatric tertiary referral hospital. We identified 25 children from the Radiology Information System who underwent studies with enteric water-soluble iodine contrast and had opacification of the urinary bladder. Demographic and clinical information for the 24 hours preceding the contrast study, findings from the radiographic studies, and surgery and pathology results were recorded. We identified patients who required surgical intervention within three days of the contrast study. We evaluated the correlation of presence of urinary contrast with need for surgery for bowel perforation or obstruction and pathologic findings. Statistical significance was calculated with chi-square test for categorical variables and ANOVA for continuous variables.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Seven of the 25 children underwent surgery after demonstration of opacification of the bladder with iodinated enteric contrast.&nbsp;Six patients had bowel perforation or necrosis. The remaining patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy for concern of obstruction secondary to Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease and was found to have no ganglion cells in the proximal small bowel. Four of the seven patients had two or more hemodynamic or lab derangements. All seven&nbsp;patients who underwent laparotomy with bladder opacification were younger than four months and had evidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and/or intestinal obstruction.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Bladder opacification after enteral contrast in children may be seen without bowel perforation or necrosis. Presence of tachycardia, hypotension, fever, leukocytosis, or metabolic acidosis did not correlate with the need for operation.

Single site laparoscopic appendectomy (SILA) has not yet been shown to have superiority over&nbsp;conventional 3-port laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA). There may be a cosmetic benefit to a single intra-umbilical scar, but the technique can be technically challenging. We investigated the outcomes in pediatric patients undergoing SILA compared to CLA, including&nbsp;length of operation, length of stay, time to resumption of regular diet, follow up, and rehospitalization.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;After IRB approval (#5200119), data was collected from medical records of children 1-18 years who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy at Loma Linda University from 2018 to 2020. Interval appendectomies were excluded. Data were analyzed using two-sample T, chi-squared, and Fisher&rsquo;s exact tests as appropriate, using Python software.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;173 patients were included, of whom 77 underwent SILA and 96 had CLA. 85 patients were female (49%), while 88 were males, with no difference between the operative groups. The average age was 10.3 years (range 2.3-17.9), with no significant difference between the operative groups. The patients were mostly Hispanic (84 percent, or 144 individuals), with no difference between the groups. The mean leukocyte count (WBC) upon presentation was 17.5 x10<sup>3</sup>/mL in the SILA group, compared to 15.3 x10<sup>3</sup>/mL in the CLA group (p=0.004). The mean length of operation was 47.0 for SILA compared 49.5 minutes for CLA (p=0.269). Of the SILA cases, 55.8% were simple appendicitis on pathology findings, while 53.3% of the CLA cases were simple appendicitis (p=0.857), as opposed to complex, including perforated. Regular diet was resumed after 1.7 days in the SILA group, compared to 1.1 days in CLA (p= 0.018). Average length of stay was 2.9 days for SILA, compared to 2.4 days for CLA (p=0.144). Seven children required hospital readmission, 5 in the SILA group and 2 in the CLA group (p=0.244). Five of the children who returned had intra-abdominal abscesses, of whom four had undergone SILA technique.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The two operative techniques had similar outcomes and operative times. However, the SILA group had slightly higher WBC upon presentation, and longer time to resumption of regular diet despite no difference in simple versus complex pathology. There was a trend toward more intra-abdominal abscesses in the SILA group. This study was limited by including a small number of patients analyzed in retrospect at a single institution with two surgeons. Further study and longer follow up is needed to determine if there is an advantage to one laparoscopic approach over another.&nbsp;

Kelley-Quon<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Children's Hospital Los Angeles,Los Angeles, CA, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Southern California,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Ketorolac (Toradol&reg;)&nbsp;&ndash; a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug &ndash; can be used as part of an opioid-sparing regimen for postoperative pain management. However, surgeons may avoid ketorolac due to a possible increased risk of bleeding.&nbsp;We hypothesized that perioperative ketorolac used in children undergoing appendectomy for perforated appendicitis was not associated with clinically significant postoperative bleeding requiring blood transfusion.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective cohort analysis of healthy children 2-18 years who underwent appendectomy for perforated appendicitis from 2009-2019 was performed using the Pediatric Health Information System&reg;&nbsp;(PHIS). Receipt of blood transfusion within 30 days of surgery was evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression with mixed effects modeling was used to evaluate the association between perioperative ketorolac use and postoperative blood transfusions, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. An interaction was evaluated between ketorolac and perioperative ibuprofen administration due to the risk of NSAID-related adverse effects.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Overall, 56,719 children with perforated appendicitis underwent appendectomy and 189 (0.3%) received a blood transfusion within 30 days of surgery. Of the 46,489 (82%) children who received perioperative ketorolac, 14,929 (32%) also received ibuprofen during hospitalization. On unadjusted analysis, children who received ketorolac were less likely to require blood transfusions than children who did not receive ketorolac (0.3% vs. 0.5%, p&lt;0.001). This relationship persisted on multivariable regression analysis; perioperative ketorolac was associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving a blood transfusion within 30 days (aOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36-0.82). A significant interaction between ketorolac and ibuprofen was noted as patients who received both analgesics were more likely to require a blood transfusion within 30 days compared to ketorolac exposed patients (OR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.52-2.96). Use of ibuprofen alone was not associated with increased risk of postoperative blood transfusion.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Significant postoperative bleeding requiring transfusion is rare after appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. Perioperative ketorolac alone was not associated with clinically significant bleeding requiring blood transfusions in children undergoing appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. Use of both ketorolac and ibuprofen was associated with an increased likelihood of bleeding requiring a blood transfusion. Ketorolac alone may be safe to administer for post-appendectomy pain control, but surgeons and anesthesiologists should ensure that patients have not also received ibuprofen during hospitalization.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective cohort study of all patients that underwent the trephination (Gip&rsquo;s) procedure as part of standard of care for the treatment of pilonidal disease from November 1, 2019 to July 31, 2020 was performed.&nbsp; Patient demographics, individual risk factors, and any previous treatment related to pilonidal disease were identified and recorded.&nbsp; Post-operative outcome measures included development of a chronic wound, signs of recurrent disease, and need for re-operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In total, 17 patients underwent the trephination procedure as part of standard of care.&nbsp; The majority of patients were male (53%) and white (65%).&nbsp; Prior to surgery, 11 (65%) of patients had documented hair in the gluteal cleft and 1 (6%) had a history of trauma to the area.&nbsp; The mean number of disease episodes prior to surgery was 1.76 (SD 0.17), with the most common symptoms being pain (100%) and drainage (78%).&nbsp; In the operating room, the mean number of pits excised was 3.82 (SD 1.94) and there were no reported complications or changes in diagnosis.&nbsp; Following trephination, 8 (47%) patients required at least 1 application of silver nitrate, 3 (18%) underwent a second operation, and only 11 (65%) were ultimately found to be completely healed at the conclusion of the study period.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The use of the trephination procedure has grown in recent years as surgeons explore less invasive alternatives to the more extensive operations traditionally used to treat pilonidal disease.&nbsp; Early results for trephination at our institution shows a high rate of post-operative healing complications, leading to frequent office procedures and re-operation.&nbsp; Given the impact on quality of life for those that are affected, it is important that future research be directed toward discovery of the best practices for treating this challenging disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;

We predict that following initial hospitalization for repair, CDH survivors face many barriers to receiving this care.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;After IRB approval, a retrospective review of all CDH patients who underwent repair at Riley Hospital for Children (RHC) at Indiana University Health from 2010 through 2019 between ages of 0 to 12 years was conducted. CDH survivors&rsquo; follow up status was reviewed and all were contacted via phone, mail, and/or email. Each family was asked to complete a survey regarding various aspects of their child&rsquo;s care, including functional status, quality of life, and barriers to care.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;One hundred fourteen patients underwent a CDH repair during this time; 70 were eligible for contact after exclusions (deceased (n=43), age&gt;12 years at repair (n=1)). Of the eligible patients, 33 (47%) were lost to follow up to all providers or pediatric surgery at RHC, while 37 (53%) had either graduated from regular follow-up or continued to follow-up with the necessary providers at RHC. Patients lost to follow-up were as sick as those who maintained follow-up with respect to their CDH study group defect severity type (A-D, p=0.5663) and ECMO requirements (p=0.3533). Seventeen (32%) families completed the survey. Of these, 88% continued to follow up at RHC for at least one healthcare need, seeing an average of 2 specialist providers (range 0 to 7), and 81% of patients&rsquo; follow-up needs were coordinated through their primary pediatrician. Of survey responses, common themes to barrier to care were ascertained; Table 1 demonstrates those affected by each barrier. The largest barrier to care was related to the physical distance and time constraints making compliance to follow-up with provider(s) difficult (62.5%), while the next largest barrier was access to a pediatric surgeon for questions and information when there was a perceived issue surrounding the CDH repair (37.5%). One hundred percent of survey responders expressed interest in a multi-disciplinary CDH clinic for their child&rsquo;s care.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The CDH population is a group of patients with many needs beyond initial repair, but attrition to follow-up after discharge is high. The most common perceived barrier to this care relates to problems with access to care. Multidisciplinary efforts, such as dedicated CDH clinic with a pediatric surgeon and nurse care coordinator, may offer an opportunity to address these barriers.

Barrios<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - Irvine,Department Of Surgery, Division Of Trauma, Burns, Critical Care & Acute Care Surgery,Orange, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;In the United States, over 65% of motor vehicle accident (MVA) victims tested positive for commonly abused drugs or alcohol, with a sharp upward trend in mortality occurring at age 21. Studies have also shown a correlation between birthdays and Emergency Department visits. However, there is a lack of studies on the relationship between birthdays and trauma. Similar to previous studies, we hypothesize that alcohol is often associated with birthday celebrations and poor decision-making, which may play a role in increasing injury severity and inhibiting recovery rates.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This was a retrospective institutional study using data collected from&nbsp;January 2017 to December 2019. There were 12,044 unique patients over age 18 included. Patients were identified as those admitted within seven days of their birthday (W+), and those who were not (W-). Patients were stratified as young adults (18&ndash;30 years old), middle-aged (31&ndash;54 years old), older adults (55&ndash;70 years old), or elderly adults (71+ years old). Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Length of Stay (LOS) were correlated with Blood Alcohol Content (BAC). All data was analyzed using unpaired, 2-tailed Student&rsquo;s T-tests, and the results were assessed at a 95% confidence interval.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In total, 373 patients (3%) were admitted within &plusmn;7 days of their birthdate (W+) When comparing mean ISS, BAC, and LOS in the W+ vs W- cohorts overall, no statistically significant differences were found (p=0.10, 0.69, 0.66). When stratified by age, however, the W+ 31&ndash;54 age group showed not only a significantly lower mean ISS (p=0.04), but also the highest mean BAC amongst the age strata. Interestingly, female W+ trauma patients had higher BAC levels than average, reaching comparable levels to W+ males (W+ male&nbsp;vs female BAC) than females in general (W+ vs W- female BAC).&nbsp;Mean LOS data reported no statistical differences between W+ and W- cohorts when stratified by age, though patients in the W+ 55&ndash;70 age group had the highest mean LOS. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients sustaining alcohol-related trauma near&nbsp;their birthdays demonstrate similar attributes to the general trauma population. However, our data indicated that younger patients had a higher risk of injury severity despite similar alcohol levels across ages. Opportunities remain for targeted programs related to alcohol-related injury awareness. Future studies for effective education and intervention are warranted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

There were 550,000 people experiencing homelessness (EH) in the US in 2018, and their traffic exposure differs from that of housed pedestrians. We aim to characterize the sociodemographic factors of people EH who sustain traffic crashes and evaluate differences in injury severity and hospital course when compared to housed individuals.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Trauma registry data was obtained from the only level 1 trauma center in a large, urban area from 2008-2016. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared for traffic crashes involving injured pedestrians or cyclists with and without a fixed address, as a conservative proxy for homelessness. Chi-squared and nonparametric tests were used to analyze 8,765 victims of traffic crashes.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In total, 6.6% of pedestrian and cyclist traffic crash victims were EH. Compared to housed victims, people EH were older (42 vs. 38, p&lt;0.05), more often male (84% vs. 64%, p&lt;0.05) and Black (23% vs. 10%, p&lt;0.05), had Medicaid coverage (47% vs. 20%, p&lt;0.05) and were injured between midnight and 6:00am (21% vs. 11%, p&lt;0.05). Victims EH were more likely to require the highest-level trauma activation (relative risk 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.0); require hospitalization (RR 1.8, CI 1.5-2.1), ICU admission (RR 1.5, CI 1.2-2.0), or surgery (RR 1.8, CI 1.3-2.4); and be discharged to a medical-based transitional facility (RR 6.3, CI 4.9-8.0). Injury severity scores were higher for victims EH (8.4 vs 7.3, p&lt;0.05) as were the lengths of hospital admission (9.7 vs. 4.2 days, p&lt;0.05) and ICU admission (8.2 vs. 6.3 days, p&lt;0.05). Mortality rates did not differ by housing status.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Traffic injuries sustained by people EH were more severe and led to longer hospitalization and ICU stays compared to housed individuals. Furthermore, people EH were likely to require ongoing health services after discharge. Addressing traffic injuries in the homeless population requires a multidisciplinary approach including initiatives to decrease traffic injuries, upstream public health interventions to address homelessness, and coordinated discharge planning to promote recovery after injury in this vulnerable population.

Mechanisms behind such disparities are not fully understood. Differences in outcomes may be due to unconscious bias and/or proven inequalities&nbsp;in imaging, interventions and discharge disposition. Times to diagnosis and definitive treatment are key in trauma care and delays have a crucial impact. In this study we investigate&nbsp;the effects of patient characteristics on timing of transfer from the emergency department (ED)&nbsp;to definitive care (i.e. floor, intensive care unit&nbsp;and operating room); we also explore&nbsp;whether patient factors influence&nbsp;likelihood of admission from the ED, hospital length of stay (LOS) and rates of in-hospital complications and death.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients &ge;18 referred to the trauma service via activation between 1/1/16 and 12/31/18 were recruited retrospectively. Data were abstracted from the institutional trauma registry and via chart review. Outcomes were explored with negative binomial and logistic regressions.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;1219 patients were included; most of them were male (68.5%), white (56.8%) and between 25-50 years of age (41.3%). 12.9% of patients were Black and 9% Asian/Pacific Islander. 13.7% were uninsured. Most presented with Glasgow coma scale score (GCS) &ge;13 (88.5%) and injury severity score (ISS) &lt;9 (63.3%), but 14.7% were major traumas (ISS&gt;15). Average hospital LOS was 5 days and mortality was 5.9%. Time to definitive care was not associated with sex, age, race, insurance type, day and/or time of presentation to the ED. Shorter time to transfer was associated with higher activation level (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.93, p=0.0064), higher ISS (IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95-0.97, p&lt;0.0001) and lower GCS (IRR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11, p=0.0020). Time to definite care was not associated with overall LOS, complication rates and/or in-hospital mortality. Similarly, race, sex and socioeconomic status were not associated with likelihood of admission from the ED, overall LOS, in-hospital mortality or complications. On the other hand, uninsured patients were significantly less likely to be admitted from the ED (odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% CI 0.17-0.51, p&lt;0.0001) while being more likely to experience shorter hospital stays (IRR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.78, p=0.0068) and higher death rates (OR 486.62, 95% CI 11.9-19816.76, p=0.0011). As expected, all secondary outcomes were also associated with markers of injury severity.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Insurance status was a major determinant of outcomes; we found no sex, race, age or socioeconomic disparity in timing of transfer to definitive care&nbsp;at least at our single center, perhaps indicating that trauma protocols for the acute management of injury preserves equity. Further investigation on the mechanism of disparities in trauma must investigate processes of care after the initial evaluation.&nbsp;

In transfers of pediatric trauma patients who are likely to require care in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), there are no formal guidelines for transfer through the trauma bay versus transfer directly to the ICU. Protocols can be widely variable between institutions. The aim of this study is to evaluate if there were differences in mortality between the two groups, and if initial intervention was delayed by care in the ICU after transfer from another institution versus patients who were first evaluated in the trauma bay.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We analyzed trauma transfers with admission to the PICU from our institution&rsquo;s trauma registry between January 2016 and December 2018. Demographics and interventions were analyzed using multivariate statistical models, with primary outcome being mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 192 patients were admitted to the ICU, as direct transfers or after evaluation in the trauma bay. Trauma bay patients had a mortality rate of 3.6% (n=4) versus 12.2% (n=10) for direct admits. Mean time to imaging for the direct group was 124.82 minutes (SD=138.03) and for the trauma bay group was 83.51 minutes (SD=155.84, p=0.001). There was no difference in time to imaging (p=0.82) between survivors and non-survivors. Patients with a lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score&nbsp;were more likely to be directly admitted (n=9.53, p&le;.001) and were also more likely to have died, even when adjusted for other variables. (n=4.0, p&lt;0.001)

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Patients who were directly admitted to the ICU saw higher mortality rates, but this may be due to physician bias to transfer non-survivable injuries who would not benefit from operation or additional imaging to the ICU since we did not find any delays to imaging or to intervention. This is supported by our finding that those with a lower GCS were more likely to be directly admitted to the PICU.

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death among the pediatric&nbsp;population and yet does not have a universally accepted treatment protocol.&nbsp;Due to the differences between&nbsp;pediatric&nbsp;and adult cranial&nbsp;distensibility&nbsp;and response to changes in&nbsp;intracranial pressure (ICP),&nbsp;treatment&nbsp;options&nbsp;in adults may not translate to successful treatment of children.&nbsp;According to trauma protocol, Decompressive Craniectomy (DC) is a&nbsp;Tier&nbsp;3&nbsp;approach to lowering ICP in pediatric TBI cases.&nbsp;A key factor in outcomes&nbsp;is the time from onset of injury to completion of DC.&nbsp;Moreover,&nbsp;early versus late DC is&nbsp;not well defined and the impact of&nbsp;stabilization prior to DC&nbsp;in the pediatric population is unknown.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This is a retrospective chart review&nbsp;of children from 0-18 years of age and a diagnosis of TBI&nbsp;presenting to the&nbsp;Emergency&nbsp;Room&nbsp;(ER)&nbsp;to assess the benefit of&nbsp;stabilization treatments prior to DC and&nbsp;the&nbsp;associated surgical outcomes.&nbsp;Patients&nbsp;with any significant&nbsp;congenital&nbsp;comorbidity&nbsp;(e.g.&nbsp;Chiari malformation), psychiatric diagnosis, and pregnant women were excluded.&nbsp;We compared discharge Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) values, as well as our own defined variable, Outcome at Discharge:&nbsp;death (6), resolution of hematoma and symptomatic (5), behavioral change (4), persistence of hematoma and symptomatic (3), persistence of hematoma and asymptomatic (2), and complete resolution (1).&nbsp;A one-way ANOVA test was used to examine whether the administration of stabilization treatments&nbsp;(ventilation&nbsp;or intubation, ICP monitoring,&nbsp;external ventricular&nbsp;drain,&nbsp;sedatives,&nbsp;3% saline,&nbsp;muscle relaxants, or&nbsp;ventriculoperitoneal&nbsp;shunt)&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;DC&nbsp;affects the outcome of such patients relative to those who did not receive such treatment.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

155&nbsp;patients fit the inclusion criteria:&nbsp;95&nbsp;were male&nbsp;(61.3%)&nbsp;and&nbsp;60&nbsp;were female (38.7%)&nbsp;with a mean age of 6.35&plusmn;6.01&nbsp;and&nbsp;admit GCS&nbsp;of&nbsp;11.08&plusmn;5.03.&nbsp;61&nbsp;(39.4%)&nbsp;patients&nbsp;underwent DC&nbsp;and, of those,&nbsp;36&nbsp;received stabilization treatment and&nbsp;25&nbsp;received no stabilization treatment. Within our sample of TBI patients undergoing&nbsp;DC, there was a difference in&nbsp;Outcome at&nbsp;Discharge and discharge GOS between patients receiving pre-surgery stabilization and those who did not receive pre-surgery stabilization&nbsp;(p-value &lt;0.05). Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated the mean&nbsp;Outcome at&nbsp;Discharge and mean discharge GOS for patients receiving no stabilization treatment (2.33&plusmn;1.71 and 4.66&plusmn;0.97, respectively) were&nbsp;significantly different than those who did (3.34&plusmn;1.80, and&nbsp;3.74&plusmn;1.39, respectively).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

This information has potential application for all pediatric patients presenting with TBI. For surgical TBI patients, physicians might consider limiting extensive stabilization treatment prior to decompressive craniectomy and instead immediately performing the procedure upon intake in the&nbsp;ER. This data could be useful in establishing an effective standard of care and contribute to better outcomes for pediatric patients who present with TBI.&nbsp;

Velopulos<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver,Division Of GI, Trauma, And Endocrine Surgery (GITES),Aurora, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Suicide rates for sexual minorities are higher than the heterosexual population, particularly for the young. The purpose of this study is to explore circumstances surrounding suicide completion for identified men and women in these populations as compared to their heterosexual counterparts to inform future intervention strategies for suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We completed an analysis of data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) from 2013-2017. Victims identified as transgender were considered separately, as this is an important population with unique characteristics. Data was further excluded from state/year combinations when sexual orientation was documented for &lt;20% of patients. We stratified analysis by identified sex of the victim (male or female) for the LGB population.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 16,831 victims whose sexual orientation or transgender status was known, 3886 (23.1%) were identified as female and 12,945 (76.9%) were identified as male. 479 (2.8%) were identified as LGBT; of these, 53 (11%) were transgender. LGBT victims were younger than non-LGBT victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;Male LGB victims were more likely to have a history of prior suicide attempts, past or current mental illness diagnosis, and were less likely to use firearms than male heterosexual victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;Female LGB victims were more likely to have known problems in an intimate partner relationship (IPV) than heterosexual women, while LGB men were more likely to have problems in family or other relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;Transgender victims were again more likely to have mental health problems and a history of prior attempts, but less likely to have intimate partner problems and more likely to have a history of child abuse (6% vs. 1%, p=0.01).&nbsp;&nbsp;All LGBT victims were more likely to disclose intent, with female LGB victims most often disclosing to an intimate partner, while male LGB and transgender individuals most likely to disclose to a family member.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our analysis reveals that circumstances surrounding suicide have important distinctions between LGBT and heterosexual individuals. It is important to note that post-mortem identification of sex presents issues of misgendering, and could contribute to a degree of bias in understanding the way suicide circumstances differ in LGBT individuals, particularly for transgender individuals. These results highlight the importance of promoting suicide interventions that recognize the complex intersection between stated gender, sex, and sexuality and the different cultural impacts these interplaying identities can have, which underscores the importance of being able to identify these patients correctly in the context of large datasets.

Our study aims to quantify the Potentially Preventable Readmissions (PPRs) in trauma care to serve as the anchor point for ongoing efforts to curb hospital readmissions and ultimately, bring preventable readmissions to zero.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We identified inpatient hospitalizations after trauma as well as readmissions within 90 days in the 2017 National Readmissions Database (NRD). PPRs were defined as the AHRQ-defined Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions, in addition to superficial surgical site infection, acute kidney injury/acute renal failure, and aspiration pneumonitis. Mean costs for these admissions were calculated using the NRD. A multivariable logistic regression model was utilized to characterize the relationship between payer type (Private, Medicare, Medicaid, Uninsured) and PPR.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 712,008 patients were admitted for trauma care in the 2017 NRD and 102,267 (14.4%) were readmitted within 90 days of discharge. Of these readmissions, 38.8% were potentially preventable. The mean cost was $10,088/PPR, resulting in $1.13 billion in cost to the US healthcare system. Of readmitted trauma patients &lt; 65 years old, Medicaid patients had 3-fold increased odds (OR 2.99, CI 2.78-3.20), and uninsured patients 47% increased odds (OR 1.47, CI 1.30-1.65), of PPRs compared to private insurance patients. Furthermore, as the days from discharge increased, the proportion of readmissions due to PPRs increased (Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Almost 40% of all trauma readmissions are potentially preventable, which account for over $1 billion in healthcare costs. As the days from discharge increase, as do the proportion of readmissions due to potentially preventable conditions. Improved access to post-discharge ambulatory care may be key to minimizing PPRs, especially in the Medicaid and uninsured populations.&nbsp;

The significance of a facet dislocation in patients with cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI) continues to be debated. The aim of this study was to examine if the presence of a cervical facet dislocation was associated with greater neurological deficit and increased ventilation requirements.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This IRB-approved retrospective cohort study included 255 CSCI patients with neurological deficit admitted to one of three Level 1 Trauma Centers between 2015 and 2020. There were 56 patients with radiologically-confirmed facet dislocations (FD) compared to 199 patients without facet dislocations (NFD). Analyzed variables included: age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for spine, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment grade, presence of cervical vertebral fracture, formation of paravertebral hematoma, rate of ICU admission, requirement for mechanical ventilation, rate of tracheostomy, and rate of cervical spine surgical intervention.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Facet dislocations were present in 21.9% of CSCI patients with neurological deficits. Patients in the FD and NFD groups were similar in age (55.1 vs 58.4, p=0.3), ISS (23.3 vs 20.3, p=0.1), and GCS (13.4 vs 13.2, p=0.7) rendering them comparable. The distribution of AIS for spine between the two groups was found to be significantly different (p=0.008), with the FD group having more patients with combined critical and maximal AIS spine severity scores (39.3% vs 22.1%). The distribution of ASIA impairment grades between the two groups was also found to be statistically different (p=0.006). Neurological deficit was more pronounced in FD patients, as indicated by a more severe ASIA grade (A and B) and a larger likelihood of developing motor paralysis (41.1% vs 19.6%). Cervical vertebral fractures were significantly more common in the FD group (89.3% vs 45.7%, p&lt;0.001). Paravertebral hematomas developed in 30% of all patients, with 80% of paravertebral hematomas causing spinal cord impingement. Significantly more paravertebral hematomas were found in the FD group (44.6% vs 26.1%, p=0.008). Rate of ICU admission was significantly higher for the FD group (91.1% vs 69.8%, p=0.001), so was the rate of mechanical ventilation (51.8% vs 29.6%, p=0.002), which included tracheostomy (30.4% vs 13.6%, p=0.003) [Fig. 1]. In addition to traction, cervical spine surgery was performed at a significantly higher rate in the FD group (85.7% vs 58.3%, p&lt;0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Facet dislocations occurred in one-fifth of CSCI patients with neurological deficit, and were associated with more severe neurological deficit and a greater need for mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy.

We aimed to determine the incidence of clinically relevant incidentalomas (CRIs), the rate of documentation, frequency of patient follow-up and subsequent need for intervention.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a retrospective review of all level 1 and 2 trauma patients at a single academic center from 1/2017-12/2019. All patients &gt; 18 years of age with at least one CT scan were included. CRIs were defined as masses with potential for malignancy. Patients with CRIs who were notified during index trauma admission were prospectively surveyed to determine frequency of follow-up and subsequent intervention for CRIs.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 3,464 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 310 patients (9%) had CRIs. Median [IQR] age was 60 [42-73], with 88 (28.4%) residing out-of-state and 115 (37.1%) uninsured. Thyroid (n=71, 22.9%) and pulmonary nodules (n=80, 25.8%) were the most common CRIs. Of these patients, 144 (46%) had documentation that they were notified of the finding. 44 patients with CRIs participated in the phone survey (response rate 30.1%) (Fig 1). 23 (52%) were aware of their CRI, 16 (70%) of whom received the recommended follow-up. 6 patients (37.5%) who followed-up ultimately required surgical intervention, with 4 malignancies identified.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: CRIs were identified in 9% of trauma patients at a single level 1 trauma center. Documentation and patient notification were inconsistent and nearly half of patients presumed to be notified were unaware of their findings. Of patients who were aware and completed follow-up, one third ultimately required surgical intervention for a potentially life threatening condition. Efforts to systematize communication with patients and their outpatient follow-up are needed to ensure necessary treatment is received.

Schuster<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine,New Haven, CT, USA <sup>2</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine,Department Of General Surgery, Trauma & Surgical Critical Care,New Haven, CT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Empiric antibiotic coverage for patients in surgical intensive care units (SICUs) typically cover methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA). Nasal surveillance for MRSA upon SICU admission may mitigate against the need to use anti-MRSA antibiotics empirically. This study aims to examine the clinical value of serial MRSA surveillance nasal swabs during a SICU admission. We hypothesized that a negative MRSA swab on admission can effectively exclude a MRSA diagnosis on subsequent surveillance and precludes the need for MRSA coverage when empiric antibiotics are initiated.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary-care medical center with 39 SICU beds. For all patients admitted to any of the 3 adult surgical intensive care from 6/1/2014 through 6/1/2019, all results of MRSA nasal surveillance cultures on SICU admission were collected along with weekly MRSA surveillance and clinical cultures during their respective admission. Each patient was reviewed for their initial MRSA surveillance culture at admission and any subsequent MRSA surveillance cultures during their stay in the SICU. Demographic and test outcomes were determined for each group.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;7,269 MRSA surveillance cultures from 6,036 unique individuals were identified. 1,125 (18.64%) unique individuals had two or more MRSA nasal surveillance cultures during a SICU stay over the 5-year period. Of those patients with multiple MRSA surveillance cultures, there were 38 (0.63%) unique patients across 101 tests who had a least one positive test during their SICU stay. Of the patients that tested positive with multiple surveillance cultures during their SICU stay, 13 (0.22%) unique patients were identified who presented with an initial negative MRSA surveillance culture and subsequently tested positive later in the same SICU stay. For these individuals, the mean transition period from negative to positive using MRSA nasal surveillance cultures was found to be 8.8 days (Median: 5.9 days; Range: 0.7 days to 28.3 days).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;While current MRSA surveillance guidelines suggest regular cultures, the rate of positive detection following a negative initial MRSA surveillance culture is low, suggesting serial MRSA surveillance swabs may have little clinical value. Further analysis is needed to determine the detection of MRSA in subsequent cultures, done for diagnostic purposes, to fully assess the utility of regular MRSA surveillance cultures.

The specific aim of this study was to describe the natural history and patient characteristics of failed extubation in trauma patients, and determine whether tracheostomy or another attempt at extubation is more appropriate. We hypothesized that patients undergoing tracheostomy would have more severe traumatic brain and chest injuries.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Adult trauma patients admitted to our urban American College of Surgeons verified Level I trauma center from 2013 to 2019 were identified from the trauma registry.&nbsp; Patients met inclusion criteria if they had at least one failed extubation during admission, defined as an unplanned intubation within 48 hours of extubation.&nbsp; Demographics, injury patterns, and outcomes were abstracted from the registry and chart review.&nbsp; Patients who underwent tracheostomy were compared to those who had subsequent attempts at extubation.&nbsp; Patients were excluded from the analysis if they transitioned to comfort care and underwent a palliative extubation.&nbsp; The primary outcomes included mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), ventilator days, and hospital LOS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The population included 96 patients who failed extubation and met inclusion criteria.&nbsp; The mean age was 55&plusmn;18, 70% were male, and 90% were the results of a blunt mechanism.&nbsp;&nbsp; A total of 56 patients (58%) were ultimately successfully extubated, while 40 patients (42%) underwent a tracheostomy.&nbsp; There was no statistically significant difference in age, gender, mechanism of injury, admission vital signs, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Injury Severity Scores, or head and chest Abbreviated Injury Scale scores.&nbsp; Patients who underwent tracheostomy had a longer ICU length of stay (LOS) (19&plusmn;8 vs 14&plusmn;9, p=0.02) and more ventilator days (15&plusmn;6 vs 11&plusmn;8, p=0.003).&nbsp; There was no difference in mortality or hospital length of stay between the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Although injury patterns typically play a role in decisions regarding tracheostomy, we found no differences in characteristics between patients who underwent tracheostomy versus those who were successfully extubated.&nbsp; Additional attempts at extubation did not increase mortality, and tracheostomy was associated with longer ICU LOS and ventilator days.&nbsp; Trauma patients who fail extubation warrant consideration for subsequent attempts at extubation rather than proceeding directly to tracheostomy.&nbsp;

Digit replantation is the ideal procedure for such injuries under appropriate conditions. We aimed to evaluate the various factors that may affect the surgical management for these patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Trauma Data Bank 2007-2016 was queried to identify patients that underwent an upper extremity traumatic single digit/thumb amputation. Patients with severe trauma (ISS&ge;&nbsp;15) were excluded. Patients that underwent either a formal replantation or replantation were evaluated. Patient, injury, socio-economic and institutional characteristics were assessed between groups of patients that underwent formal amputation vs. replantation. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify independent factors affecting odds of replantation vs. formal amputation.

Majority were finger injuries (81% vs. 19% thumb injuries). Demographic characteristics of the two groups are represented in table 1. Thumb injuries were more commonly replanted (31% vs. 12% finger). Comparing replantation to amputation revealed that the incidence for the former were higher in the Northeast (18% vs. 11%) and West (16% vs. 14%) regions (p&lt;0.0001). Majority of the replantations were performed at university hospitals (77%), hospitals with &gt; 400 beds (83%) and at level 1 trauma centers (85%). On multivariable analysis, having a thumb injury (OR 3.28, p&lt;0.0001), age &lt; 18 years (OR 6.13, p&lt;0.001), having private insurance (OR 1.17, p 0.01), presenting to a hospital in the northeast (OR 1.6, p&lt;0.0001) or west (OR 1.40, p 0.001) US region, level 1 trauma center (OR 1.49, p &lt;0.0001) or a university teaching hospital (OR 1.59, p=0.002) were all independent factors for undergoing a replantation vs. formal amputation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Replantation is favored for traumatic thumb amputations. Age, insurance status along with institutional characteristics including region impact choice of procedure performed.

We sought to investigate a similar association in liver trauma using obesity as a proxy for NAFLD.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) database was queried for adults (&ge;18 years) with liver lacerations. Because NAFLD is not accurately captured by TQIP, we selected obesity as a proxy, as there is a strong link between the two, with step-wise increase in NAFLD with increasing obesity severity. Subjects were divided into 3 groups based on traditional body mass index (BMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup>) definitions of obesity: underweight (&lt;18.5), non-obese (18.5-29.9), and obese (&ge; 30) then stratified by liver Abbreviated Injury Scale (Grade 2-5). Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed for multiple comparisons followed by Dunn&rsquo;s tests for pairwise analysis to compare transfusion requirements of each pair among the groups using the number of blood units transfused in the first 24 h after admission. Holm-Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons, and p-values &lt; .05 were considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 17,953 subjects were included in the study: 3% underweight with mean age of 37&plusmn;19 years and 48% male, 69% nonobese with mean age of 38&plusmn;17 years and 67% male, and 28% obese with mean age of 41&plusmn;16 years and 60% male. For almost every liver injury grade, there were higher red blood cell transfusion requirements in the first 24 h among obese patients compared to both nonobese patients and underweight patients. Corrected p-values are listed in the Table respectively for the group pairwise comparisons: obese vs. underweight and obese vs. non-obese.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In liver trauma, obesity is associated with increased blood transfusion requirements in the first 24 hours. The relationship between obesity and NAFLD raises the possibility that underlying liver disease, not obesity itself, may be a factor associated with increased transfusion requirements. Additional research is needed to study the potential effect of other covariates.

Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System (SURPAS) uses 8 variables to predict 12 adverse outcomes for &gt;3000 operations in 9 specialties. We sought to determine whether SURPAS can accurately predict postoperative ICU need.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This was a retrospective observational analysis of the 2009-2018 American College of Surgeons&rsquo; National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. The 8 variable SURPAS model was compared to a model using all 29 preoperative variables available in the database. The main outcome was &ldquo;ICUneed,&rdquo; defined as one or more of the following: cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, unplanned intubation, prolonged postoperative ventilation, septic shock, or in-hospital death. Internal, chronological validation of the SURPAS model was performed, using the years 2009-2017 for development and 2018 for model testing.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A measure of discrimination, c-index (c), and a combined metric of both discrimination and calibration, Brier score (BS), for the eight-variable SURPAS model (c=0.909, BS=0.0151) were close to those of the full 29-variable model (c=0.921, BS=0.0139) representing accurate modeling of the data. The SURPAS c-index and Brier score for the test (c=0.911, BS=0.0121) and training dataset (c=0.909, BS=0.0156) were virtually identical. Calibration as measured by Hosmer-Lemeshow analyses showed excellent calibration of the SURPAS model.

Optimizing timely access to trauma care for all injured children has been and continues to be a core goal for state trauma system leaders. Prior evaluations of pediatric trauma access have been infrequent, requiring proprietary geospatial software and technical expertise. We set forth to determine whether a simple, accessible geospatial approach could achieve similar results while conveying actual injury data to better inform state level systems strengthening efforts and empower more routine analyses.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Virginia was utilized as a test state due to its complex population distribution and mature trauma system. Transport boundaries were defined using one hour driving radii from all state designated trauma centers (TCs) versus PTCs which were simultaneously mapped using the Oalley drive-time visualization tool. Coverage in individual localities was applied across 2017 American Community Survey child population estimates and state-provided child injury hospitalization totals, respectively, for children from 0-14 years. &Chi;<sup>2</sup> with Yates correction was used to compare estimates. A geospatial boundary heat map was developed to visualize three components: transport boundaries in relation to facilities, actual injury data by locality, and top quartile localities for ratio of child injury hospitalizations per child census population.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;964,000 (62%) of children living in Virginia in 2017 were estimated to live beyond a one hour drive of a state PTC, 200,000 (13%) of any state trauma center. 1,928 (49%) of children hospitalized for injury in Virginia from 2016-2018 were estimated to live beyond a one hour drive of a state PTC. A geospatial boundary heat map indicated regions farthest from intrastate PTCs, including Northern Virginia, Southern Virginia, and the Eastern Shore, in perspective with annual injury hospitalizations (Figure).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;A simple geospatial method produced remarkably similar estimates for pediatric injury access to those published by national studies and was useful to identify localities where pediatric trauma system strengthening could have maximum impact. The geospatial boundary heat map differentiated need areas of high volume, which may support designation of additional facilities or reciprocity agreements, versus low-volume where alternative strategies for critical care access would be required. State leaders should consider this data in conjunction with air transport utilization data, which is readily available to them, and this method could be similarly applied in other states to help monitor access to trauma care in state pediatric populations over time.

Using novel machine-learning techniques, we sought to design a non-linear, competing risks paradigm for prediction of older adult discharge disposition and mortality following injury.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Trauma Databank (NTDB) was used to identify patients 65+ years between 2007 and 2014.&nbsp; Trauma centers with annual volume &gt; 48.2 patients per year (10%-percentile) were included.&nbsp; &nbsp;The data was partitioned by stratified random sampling based on Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), such that each stratum contained patients that were effectively independent.&nbsp; Training was performed on 224 strata (90% of the data) and inference was performed on 26 strata (10%).&nbsp; Factors included age, co-morbidities, length of stay (LOS) and physiologic parameters to predict in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition (home vs. other).&nbsp; The training was enriched by reducing the sampling rate of over-represented variables (down-sampling) to develop a predictive model for all patients (not just at the extremes).&nbsp;&nbsp; LOS and discharge status were analyzed via competing risks survival analysis with Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) and a multinomial mixed model.&nbsp; The existing Elderly Mortality After Trauma (EMAT) mobile application will be updated to predict discharge disposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The resulting sample size was 47,037 patients. &nbsp;Emergency department pulse &gt; 120 bpm and systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg were not predictive of death or discharge disposition. Admission GCS, age, year of admission were important in predicting mortality and discharge disposition.&nbsp; As GCS decreased by 2 points, patients were more likely to die (risk ratio[RR] increased by average of 1.4 per 2-point drop in GCS, p &lt;0.001) and be discharged to a nursing home instead of returning home (RR decreased by 0.08 per 2-point decrease in GCS, p &lt;0.001) see figure 1.&nbsp; RR for death increased by an average of 0.15 per 5-year increase in age and RR for discharge home decreased by an average 0.05 of per 5-year increase in age over 65 (p &lt;0.001). The AUC for prediction of discharge home was improved in the competing risks model 0.71 vs. 0.43 in the traditional multinomial mixed model.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Predicting discharge home in older adults is improved using machine learning over traditional regression analysis.&nbsp; Accurate prediction of discharge disposition is an integral tool to bedside shared decision making for older trauma patients and their families, and the updated EMAT mobile application based on this study is now available for use.&nbsp; We confirmed that a non-linear, competing risks paradigm is required for prediction of older adult discharge disposition following injury.

A decrease in total emergency department (ED) volume followed, but the impact on trauma is unknown. We hypothesized that social distancing restrictions increased intentional injuries.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Trauma/ED registries revealed adult patient data at an urban, academic, Level I trauma center. We compared injury characteristics 6 weeks pre and 10 weeks post a statewide stay-at-home order (SAHO, 3/16/2020) and compared 2020 to 2015-2019 data. &nbsp;Demographics, mechanism of injury (MOI), and diagnoses were extracted.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;357 and 480 trauma patients presented before and after SAHO, respectively. Groups demonstrated differences in sex (35.6% vs. 27.9% female, p = 0.02), age (47.4 &plusmn; 22.1 vs. 42 &plusmn; 20.3, p = 0.009), and race (1.4% vs. 2.3% Asian, 63.3% vs. 68.3% Black, 4.8% vs. 7.1% Other, 30.5% vs. 22.3% White, p=0.03). MOI after SAHO demonstrated a decrease in non-intentional trauma and an increase in intentional (GSWs, SWs, assaults) trauma (Fig 1A; p=0.0008) occurring when citywide Covid-19 infection rates increased (Fig 1B). Compared to prior years, 2020 had a significantly greater proportion of intentional violent injury (Fig 2A) and specifically, firearm injury (Fig 2B).&nbsp; There were no differences in injury severity (7.5 &plusmn; 9.1 vs. 7.9 &plusmn; 8.8) or mortality (96.1% vs. 96.0% alive) between time periods.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;While pandemic-related public health measures reduced ED and unintentional injury volume, they did not reduce intentional trauma. Instead, an increase in urban firearm-related injury occurred. These data suggest that pandemic-related public health measures should also embrace intentional injury prevention and management strategies.

De Moya<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Medical College Of Wisconsin,Division Of Trauma And Acute Care Surgery,Milwaukee, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The cardiac box was historically used to identify patients that required a pericardial window in the setting of a penetrating chest injury. Gunshot wounds (GSW) to the chest have an unpredictable trajectory and even stab wounds outside of the traditional landmarks have been associated with cardiac injury. Given the widespread availability of ultrasound we question whether the cardiac box has any clinical relevance.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a retrospective review of the trauma registry and EMR charts of adult patients with a penetrating thoracic injury admitted to a Level 1 urban trauma center between 2013 and 2017.&nbsp; Our primary outcome was penetrating cardiac injury requiring intervention. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression were performed using SPSS.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 634 patients with penetrating thoracic injuries and 265 (42%) had an injury within the cardiac box. Of those, a pericardial window was performed in 17% (45/265) and 8% (20/265) had a cardiac injury. Eighty four percent (16/19) of stab victims versus only 57% (4/7) of gunshot victims with cardiac injury sustained penetrating trauma within the box (Figure 1). Ultrasound (US) was performed in 32% (208/634) of patients with a penetrating thoracic injury and 51% (135/265) of patients with a cardiac box injury. On multivariate regression, the cardiac box was not a significant predictor for cardiac injury due to stab wounds (OR 23.3 [95% CI 0.58-926.4]) or GSWs (OR 3.14 [95% CI 0.48-20.73]). US had a higher sensitivity (83% vs 80%), specificity (93% vs 59%), and positive predictive value (54% vs 8%) than the cardiac box.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The majority of penetrating injuries to the cardiac box do not result in a cardiac injury and a fourth of our cardiac injuries were outside the box. We recommend eliminating the use of a predefined anatomical cardiac boundary and favor US imaging for any penetrating thoracic injury due to its superior diagnostic performance.

Institutional variance exists in the management of blunt splenic injuries. Currently, there are no definitive recommendations guiding the utilization or timing of repeat imaging in these patients. This study examines the rate of delayed complications (pseudoaneurysm, increased hemoperitoneum, injury progression, abscess, vascular thrombosis, pancreatic fistula, arteriovenous fistula, delayed contrast extravasation, etc.) and subsequent intervention (operative or interventional radiologic) in patients with blunt splenic injuries who undergo repeat imaging.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A three-year (2017-2019), retrospective, two-institution study was conducted of adult patients (&ge;18 years) with blunt splenic injuries. Patients were stratified based on whether repeat imaging was performed, and reason for reimaging: standard protocol (SP) or physician discretion (PD) based on clinical findings. The incidence of organ specific complications and need for subsequent intervention was examined.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 235 patients included in the study, 105 (45%) underwent repeat imaging [computed tomography (CT), n=102 or ultrasound (US), n=3]. Thirty-eight (36%) patients underwent imaging due to SP and 67 (64%) due to PD. The mean time to repeat imaging was shorter in the SP group than in the PD group (2.4 &plusmn; 1.9 days versus 5.2 &plusmn; 4.4 days, p=0.0004). Organ specific delayed complications were found in 18 (47%) SP patients versus 28 (42%) PD patients (p=0.683). Interventions for complications were performed in 10 (56%) SP patients versus 6 (21%) PD patients (p=0.027).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our data demonstrates that patients with blunt splenic injuries should undergo repeat imaging following a standard protocol to assess for delayed complications. Nearly half of patients with splenic injuries reimaged based on a standard protocol were found to have a complication, with more than half of this group requiring intervention. These complications were identified and treated earlier than complications found on repeat imaging performed due to physician discretion. A standard approach to early repeat imaging of blunt splenic injuries will allow for prompt identification and treatment of delayed complications.

The degree to which exposure of EMS personnel to high-performing&nbsp;trauma centers (TC) vs non-trauma centers (NTC) translates into meaningful difference&nbsp;in prehospital quality of care and patient outcomes remains unknown. We aimed to examine these relationships&nbsp;through characterizing prehospital tranexamic acid (TXA) administration patterns.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) 2017 dataset was queried for all injured adult patients who were transported either to a TC or NTC. Demographics of patients, geographic differences, physiologic parameters, and TXA administration were compared between the two groups. We used alpha of 0.05 for statistical significance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 390,000 adult trauma patients identified, 90% were transported to TC, 3.7% to level I TC, 47.6% were male, 84.5% were from urban settings, 5.5% had a shock index (SI)&gt;1, 2.4% had at least one episode of hypotension, and 2.1% were transported by air (TC 8.9% vs NTC 1.4%, p&lt;0.001). Patients who were transported to a TC were relatively younger (51.7 &plusmn; 22.5 vs 57.8 &plusmn; 22.9, p&lt;0.001), had higher rate of at least one episode hypotension (4.6% vs 2.2%, p&lt;0.001) and higher rate of having SI&gt;1 (9.2% vs 4.9%, p&lt;0.001). TXA was more likely to be given en route to TC vs NTC (0.2% vs 0.03%, p&lt;0.001, OR 5.8, 95%CI: 4.3-7.8). There were significantly higher rates of administering TXA for patients transported to TC who were hypotensive (1.43% vs 0.46%, p&lt;0.001), had SI&gt;1 (2.56% vs 0.92%, p&lt;0.001), or were transported by air (8.8% vs 0.33%, p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Prehospital administration of TXA remained&nbsp;very low overall in our sample, and as expected, was concentrated among&nbsp;young, male, trauma patients transported directly to a TC. While this is likely a function of urban&nbsp;setting and indication for direct transport, it is important to note that&nbsp;significant variation in prehospital protocols and TXA availability also&nbsp;bias against use in rural systems without a local TC. Further work should investigate methods to optimize feedback between trauma surgery and EMS personnel - especially within rural systems - to maximize quality of care and increase rates of appropriate interventions in the field.

The Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study database was retrospectively queried from 2003-2018 for all pediatric patients (&lt;15y) who sustained liver injury defined by ICD9/10 codes. Patients transferred in/out were excluded. Patients were categorized based on admission to PTC/ATC. Primary endpoint was mortality with secondary endpoints being operative intervention and length of stay (LOS). Multivariate logistic regressions controlling for demographic and injury covariates assessed the adjusted impact on mortality and surgical intervention.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 1600 patients who suffered liver trauma, 608 met inclusion criteria. 78.4% were treated at PTC. Characteristics of patients are in Table 1. Patients underwent hepatobiliary surgery more frequently at ATC [11.45% (n=15) vs. 3.14% (n=15), p&lt;0.001]. Adjusted analysis showed that while abdominal surgery was not different (AOR 2.66, p=0.395), there were lower odds of surgical intervention for hepatobiliary injuries at PTC (AOR: 0.20, p=0.027). There was no decrease in mortality at PTC compared to ATC (AOR: 0.30, p=0.064).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Pediatric trauma patients cared for at ATC have no difference in mortality rate, but, have higher incidence of operative management specifically for hepatobiliary injuries, when compared to PTC. Given these findings, this study demonstrates that pediatric trauma patients who present with liver injuries can be successfully managed at ATC with decreased LOS.

Trevino<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Medical College Of Wisconsin,Division Of Trauma And Acute Care Surgery,Milwaukee, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  It is well established that patients prescribed higher opioid dosages are at a higher risk of overdose and death despite achieving no added long-term pain reduction. Yet increases in opioid prescribing continue to fuel the epidemic in the US. We hypothesized that implementing a comprehensive guideline to standardize opioid prescribing would decrease the dosages prescribed at discharge for trauma patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This quasi-experimental study compared opioid prescribing by trauma providers before and after the implementation of a departmental guideline on April 1, 2019, aimed at aligning opioid prescription patterns with CDC recommendations. Patients prescribed opioids between April and December 2018 were assigned to the control group, whereas those prescribed opioids between April and December 2019 were assigned to the intervention group. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving &ge; 50 Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) per day. A subgroup analysis of patients age &ge; 64 years was performed. Chi squared and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 560 and 535 trauma patients in the control and intervention group, respectively. Total MME and maximum MME per day were 7% and 50% lower, respectively, in the intervention group as compared to the control group (p&lt;0.001). The proportion of trauma patients prescribed &ge; 50 MMEs per day decreased from 66% to 22% after policy implementation (p&lt;0.001). The proportion of trauma patients prescribed &ge; 90 MMEs per day also decreased, from 53% to 18% (p&lt;0.001). The median supply of opioids increased from 3 to 3.3 days over the same period (p=0.004). There was no change in the proportion of patients receiving a supply of &gt; 7 days (Table 1). Lower total MME, maximum MME, and proportion of trauma patients prescribed &ge; 50 and &ge; 90 MMEs per day was again seen in the subgroup of patients &ge; 64 years old.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A departmental guideline aimed at optimizing opioid prescription patterns is successful in lowering the amount of MMEs prescribed to trauma patients and thereby improving compliance with CDC best practice recommendations.

Yu<sup>1</sup>, K. Jackson<sup>1</sup>, D. Segev<sup>1</sup>, A. Massie<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Johns Hopkins University School Of Medicine,Department Of Surgery,Baltimore, MD, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

ABO type B and O recipients have increased difficulty identifying a compatible donor for living donor kidney transplantation. They are also harder to match in incompatible kidney transplantation (IKT) registries due to a shortage of ABO-compatible donors. The Kidney Allocation System (KAS), implemented in 2014, increased offers of ABO type A2 donor kidneys to type O and B recipients, and A2B to B recipients (A2i). To better inform the living donor selection process and ensure the safety of patients, we sought to evaluate the association between A2i deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT) or A2i living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) and graft and patient survival.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Using SRTR data from 2000-2019, we identified adult, first-time kidney transplant recipients with blood type O or B who underwent ABO-compatible or A2i DDKT, or ABO-compatible or A2i LDKT. Inverse probability weighted Cox regression was used to compare post-transplantation mortality, all-cause graft failure, and death-censored graft failure between A2i and compatible recipients.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

We identified 1232 DDKT recipients and 345 LDKT recipients reported as A2i. Patient mortality was comparable between A2i and compatible DDKT recipients (wHR&nbsp;<sub>0.71</sub>0.93<sub>1.21</sub>, p=0.6). There was no evidence of a difference between A2i versus compatible DDKT recipients with regards to all-cause graft failure (wHR&nbsp;<sub>0.88</sub>1.11<sub>1.40</sub>, p=0.4) and death-censored graft failure (wHR&nbsp;<sub>0.93</sub>1.24<sub>1.66</sub>, p=0.14). When comparing A2i versus compatible LDKT recipients, there was no difference in weighted post-transplant survival (wHR <sub>0.80</sub>1.06<sub>1.39</sub>, p=0.7). When death was regarded as graft failure (all-cause), the weighted hazard ratio of graft failure was <sub>1.05</sub>1.35<sub>1.73</sub> (p=0.02), when comparing A2i to compatible LDKT recipients. When death was regarded as censorship rather than graft failure (death-censored), the weighted hazard ratio was <sub>1.24</sub>1.71<sub>2.36</sub> (p=0.001), meaning that the hazard of death-censored graft failure was 1.71 times higher in A2i LDKT recipients than compatible LDKT recipients.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

There is no evidence of harm resulting from prioritizing A2i DDKT in the KAS era. There is, however, some evidence of harm resulting from prioritizing A2i LDKT in the KAS era with regards to death-censored graft failure.

Technical variant donation including split liver transplantation, reduced size and living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) have increasingly been used to meet deceased organ shortage. Single institution and national registry studies have shown that pediatric LDLT decreases waitlist mortality and offers superior post-transplant survival when compared to deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). In this study, outcomes for pediatric LDLT and DDLT were evaluated through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A systematic literature search was performed on December 2, 2019 in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Google Scholar to identify studies reporting outcomes of pediatric recipient (&lt;18 year) LDLT and DDLT published between 2005 and 2019. Studies including adult patients, multi-organ/re-transplant recipients, or those with overlapping cohorts were excluded. Perioperative and survival outcomes of pediatric-LDLT recipients were pooled and compared to those underwent pediatric-DDLT using fixed- and random-effects models.&nbsp;



<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 2518 abstract were screened, from which 11 studies were identified and included in this analysis. In total, 1704 pediatric LDLT and 6351 pediatric DDLT patients were examined. LDLT recipients had superior overall survival when compared to DDLT recipients at 1, 3, and 5 years post-LT [ 1-year OS, OR 0.52, CI 95% 0.34-0.80, =0.003; 3-year OS, OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.90, p= 0.02; 5 years OS, OR: 0.54 CI 95% 0.4-0.72, p&lt;0.0001] (Figure 1). Similarly, LDLT resulted in superior graft survival at 1-, 3- and 5-year post-LT when compared to DDLT [ 1-year graft survival, OR :0.38 CI 95% 0.29-0.50, p&lt;0.0001]. Paradoxically, LDLT was associated higher PELD at LT. There was no difference in the rate of post-LT vascular complications, biliary complications, or rates of acute rejection.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this comprehensive, global meta-analysis, LDLT was associated with higher rates of graft and patient survival post-transplant for children at all time points assessed, without any observed difference in rate of technical complications. These data support the continued expansion of LDLT for pediatric LT candidates, even in regions where DDLT is currently predominant.

Because of the effectiveness of HIV treatment, people living with HIV (PLWH) live longer and develop age related chronic kidney and liver diseases requiring transplantation. PLWH, however, are less likely to achieve transplantation. In 2013, the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (HOPE) amended the National Organ Transplant Act to allow PLWH to be organ donors. Studies related to the efficacy of HOPE vary widely as to the number of potential organs available. The purpose of this study is to analyze data on a national scale, while taking into account organ quality in order to understand the number of organs actually available for HIV+ to HIV+ transplant.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using data collected at Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Systems (CNICS) centers (1995 &ndash; 2018), 6,223 deaths (potential deceased organ donors) among PLWH were identified.&nbsp;1,137 were excluded due to cancer diagnosis. The remaining 5,086 were studied to assess organ quality/suitability. Potential deceased organ donors were further characterized as high (viral load &gt; 200 copies/mL and CD4 &lt; 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) or low (viral load &lt; &nbsp;200 copies/mL and CD4 &gt; 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) risk for transmission of resistant virus. Kidney quality was assessed using the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) with a KDPI &gt; 85 indicating poor quality. Liver viability was assessed via Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, which measures AST, ALT, platelet count, and age, with a FIB-4 score &gt; 3.25 indicating severe cirrhosis rendering the donor liver not suitable for transplantation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In 1995, 100% of PLWH were considered high risk compared to just 42% in 2017 [figure]. 3,907 potential donors were high risk. Among low risk potential donors, 605 (9.72%) had a KDPI &lt; 85, suggestive of high quality kidneys for transplant, and 967 (15.54%) had minimal (FIB-4 &lt; 1.45) to moderate cirrhosis (FIB-4 1.45-3.25), suggestive of high quality livers for transplant. Importantly, 316 (32.7%) of potential liver donors were coinfected with hepatitis C.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Since the introduction of antiretrovirals in the 1990&rsquo;s, HIV care is increasingly more accessible, targeted, and effective, and thus, over time fewer potential donors were high risk. During the 23 years covered by this study, only 25% of deaths occurred among low risk PLWH with laboratory and clinical features suggestive of high quality, transplantable organs.

","A. Aluri<sup>1</sup>, H. Fatima<sup>1</sup>, B. Shelton<sup>1</sup>, V. Kumar<sup>1</sup>, J. Locke<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,College Of Medicine,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

With the advent of anti-retroviral therapy, people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) have improved life expectancy. As a result, PLWH have developed age-related illnesses such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Of the 1.1 million PLWH in the United States as many as 30% of them have CKD. In fact, overlying CKD on a complex condition such as HIV infection may lead to worse outcomes among PLWH.

Multiple risk factors for CKD development have been identified, including genetic risk factors. While APOL1 has been well-studied in this population, UMOD, a gene located on chromosome 16, also associates with CKD in the general population but has not yet been studied among PLWH. As such, we examined the association of UMOD variants with CKD development and characterized the histologic findings of CKD among PLWH.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

PLWH enrolled in CNICS were genotyped using expanded Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array. SNPs were excluded from analysis if the call rate was &lt;98%, discordant in &gt;1 duplicate, missing in &gt; 10% of samples, and/or had a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P-value &le;1x10<sup>-5</sup>. &nbsp;We selected variants +/- 250 kb from the UMOD gene and conducted logistic regression to assess the association between each SNP and CKD development. Each model was also adjusted for age at study entry, sex, genetic ancestry, and follow-up time and was stratified by self-reported race. The effects within each race were meta-analyzed using METAL to generate one summary association. Biopsy images were read by a central pathologist.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The strongest association among African Americans was at 16:20353435 with a risk allele frequency of 2.3% and conferring 2-fold higher odds of CKD development as compared to those with no variants at that location (aOR: 2.06, 95% C: 1.22-3.48, p=0.007). Among European Whites, the strongest association was at rs76621572, 16:20384729, which had a risk allele frequency of 2.2% and conferred 3-fold higher odds of CKD development as compared to those with no variants at that location (aOR: 2.98, 95% CI: 1.32-6.73, p=0.009). &nbsp;After meta-analysis the strongest overall measure was located at 16:2035343 with a risk allele frequency of 0.8%. This variant conferred 2-fold higher odds of CKD development as compared to those with no variants (aOR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.22-3.48, p=0.006).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Some SNP variants within the uromodulin gene have a significant association with CKD development among PLWH. However, top SNP variants differ in risk allele frequency and effect size between African-Americans and European Whites. Variants at 16:20353435 and 16:20384729 were most strongly associated with CKD among &nbsp;African-Americans and European Whites, respectively. Further analysis of biopsies from patients with these variants are needed to determine the mechanism by which increased risk is conferred, specifically among PLWH.

Resweber<sup>1</sup>, J. Panichella<sup>1</sup>, A. Di Carlo<sup>1</sup>, S. Karhadkar<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Temple University,Surgery,Philadelpha, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Following kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive regiments that aim to prevent allograft rejection may simultaneously leave the patient susceptible to opportunistic infections, including the reactivation of BK polyomavirus (BKV). Although BKV Nephropathy (BKVN) was first characterized nearly fifty years ago and has since been frequently implicated in the failure kidney allografts, there is still inadequate understanding of the disease and a lack of effective therapies. For patients whose grafts fail due to BKVN, retransplantation is a viable option. This study further characterizes BK nephropathy and subsequent retransplantation in the most expansive population of this type studied to date, geographically, temporally, and in magnitude.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The OPTN/UNOS database was used to identify patients who received kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantations between October 1, 1987 and December 31, 2018 that resulted in renal allograft failure attributed to BKVN (n=1587). This population was further divided into those who underwent kidney retransplantation (n=495) and those who did not (n=1092). Subject characteristics were summarized using means and standard deviations or frequencies and percentages, as applicable. Significance between groups was determined by independent samples t-tests and &chi;<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>tests (&alpha; = 0.05.). Death-censored graft survival for various subgroups was estimated using Kaplan-Meier with Log-Rank to assess significance. All analysis was completed using SPSS Statistics 26.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The cohort that was retransplanted after BKVN failure was significantly younger and had fewer prior kidney transplants, lower EPTS scores at failure, lower rates of delayed graft function and a greater proportion of living donors when compared to those who were not retransplanted. Allograft lifespan prior to BKVN failure was significantly greater in the population that was retransplanted than the population that was not. Among retransplants, delayed graft function or high KDPI significantly decreased allograft lifespan. The retransplanted allografts lasted significantly longer than the original grafts that had failed due to BKVN. Use of steroids for induction was found to not have a significant impact on graft survival when compared to a steroid-free regiment.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study assessed trends in and characteristics of successful retransplantation after BKVN-associated graft failure, using the largest population of this type to date. Results may be used to both govern the treatment of patients who lose grafts to BKVN and reinforce the viability of retransplantation following BKVN-associated graft failure.

Preliminary data indicate that the ACA has expanded insurance coverage and healthcare access, but has not necessarily improved disparities in access to subspecialty care. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effect of ACA implementation on payor demographics and outcomes for patients&nbsp;listed for kidney transplantation.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Data for all adult patients registered for the kidney transplant waiting list in the United States between 2007 and 2018 were abstracted from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. For patients with multiple records, the first listing in the timeframe was used for analysis. Summary statistics for waiting list registrants and recipients were tabulated by era, defined as 2007-2010, 2011-2014, 2015-2018. We then performed multivariable competing risks time-to-event regression to estimate cause-specific hazard ratios of transplant and death or delisting on the waiting list to evaluate the effect of payor on waiting list outcomes over time.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 345,073 patients met the inclusion criteria.&nbsp;Compared to pre-ACA, the proportion of Asian and Hispanic patients on the waiting list increased over time (6.0, 6.9, 7.5% Asian per era, 16.4, 17.6, 19.1% Hispanic per era). Age at listing and BMI increased over time, while the proportion of patients on dialysis at time of registration decreased. The proportion of patients with Medicaid listed as their primary insurance increased from 7.4% to 7.8% and 9.8% over time, while the proportion of patients with private insurance remained relatively unchanged. Payor distribution and outcomes over time are listed in Table 1.&nbsp;Compared with the privately insured, waitlisted patients with Medicaid had an increased risk of death or delisting (Cause Specific HR 1.12 [1.09, 1.15], p&lt;0.0001) and a lower likelihood of transplant. This trend persisted over time.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite its stated goals, the passage of the ACA in 2010 led to only a modest increase in the proportion of patients on the kidney transplant waiting list who received their insurance primarily through the Medicaid expansion. This effect is likely attenuated by variable implementation at the state level. Furthermore, disparities persist in the outcomes of Medicaid patients on the kidney transplant waiting list. Our further work will focus on understanding patterns of inactivation/delisting and outcomes of transplantation among Medicaid patients.

Fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) induces systemic inflammation, a well-recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality in the general population and allograft dysfunction and mortality among kidney transplant recipients. Therefore, we hypothesize that air pollution is associated with adverse post-kidney transplant mortality and graft failure. Therefore, we sought to investigate the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and these post-transplant outcomes among kidney transplant recipients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Kidney transplant recipients who received transplantation between January 1<sup>st</sup> 2010 and December 31<sup>st</sup> 2016 were identified from the national registry of transplant recipients (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients). PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations for 2010-2016 were obtained from NASA&rsquo;s SEDAC Global Annual PM<sub>2.5 </sub>Grids. Annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration at the year of transplantation was estimated at each recipient&rsquo;s ZIP code. We accounted for demographics, socioeconomic status, recipient health factors, and transplant factors and estimated adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals [CI]) for all-cause mortality and death-censored graft failure (DCGF) using Cox proportional hazards regression with inverse probability weights.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Among 96,109 kidney transplant recipients included in our study, the median age at transplant was 53, 37,435 (39.0%) were female and 45,772 (47.6%) were non-Hispanic White. At the end of follow-up, 14,260 recipients died and 2,395 recipients experienced DCGF. The median ZIP-code level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration was 9.14 &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup> (IQR 7.56-10.69). After kidney transplant recipients living in areas with highest quartile of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration (PM2.5&ge; 10.69 &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>) had 1.09-fold (95%CI 1.02-1.15) higher mortality and 1.08-fold (95%CI 1.00-1.17) higher risk for DCGF when compared to their counterparts living in areas with lowest quartile of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (PM2.5&lt;7.56 &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>). PM<sub>2.5</sub> associated mortality was highest among recipients with cold ischemia time &gt;24hr (HR=1.18, 95%CI 1.02-1.35) while associated risk for DCGF was highest among recipients who received kidney from a donor with history of smoking&gt;20 pack-years (HR=1.19, 95%CI 1.01-1.41).

&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this population of kidney transplant recipients, exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> (&ge;10.69&mu;g/m<sup>3</sup>), which is below the current Environmental Protection Agency standard for PM<sub>2.5</sub> of 12&mu;g/m<sup>3</sup>, is associated with an increased risk for mortality and DCGF. These findings imply&nbsp;the potential need for a lower standard&nbsp;for PM<sub>2.5</sub>&nbsp;among the vulnerable population like kidney transplant recipients.

Air pollution has been repeatedly associated with cardiopulmonary disease and death in the general population. Among common pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is particularly harmful due to its ability to penetrate deeply into areas of gas exchange within the lungs. PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure has been associated with clinical declines in persons with pre-existing pulmonary diseases, including the four most common indications for lung transplant (LT). LT candidates are particularly vulnerable to cardiopulmonary insult and experience mortality rates as high as 121.8 deaths per 100 waitlist-years. For those living in heavily affected areas, PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure may pose a barrier to achieving transplantation by increasing the risk of clinical decline and death. Here we seek to investigate the association between PM<sub>2.5 </sub>exposure and adverse waitlist events among LT candidates.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data were used to identify LT candidates listed between 1/1/2010-12/31/2016. Annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration at year of listing was estimated for each candidate&rsquo;s ZIP Code using NASA&rsquo;s Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center Global Annual PM<sub>2.5 </sub>Grids. We estimated crude and adjusted hazard ratios for adverse waitlist events, defined as death or removal, using Cox proportional hazards regression. Potential covariates that were adjusted for included age at listing, sex, race, education, insurance, smoking status, blood type, and lung allocation score (LAS). The impact on demographic and clinically relevant subgroups was also explored.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 15,075 included candidates, median age at listing was 60, 43.8% were female and 81.7% were non-Hispanic white. Median ZIP Code PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration was 8.95&micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>. When compared to those who were living in ZIP Codes with lower PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure (PM<sub>2.5 </sub>&lt;10.53&micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>), candidates living in ZIP Codes in the highest quartile of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure (&ge;10.53&micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>) had a 1.15-fold (95%CI 1.02-1.30) risk of waitlist mortality and a 1.17-fold (95%CI 1.01-1.36) risk of waitlist removal due to clinical deterioration. Higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> associated risk of&nbsp;adverse waitlist events was observed among candidates with LAS&ge;45 (HR=1.45, 95%CI 1.18-1.77, p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.006).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Elevated ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration was associated with an increase in adverse waitlist events among LT candidates. The association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration<sub> </sub>and adverse outcomes was strongest among persons with more severe lung disease as evidenced by LAS&ge;45. These results suggest that elevated exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduces the likelihood of transplant among LT candidates, particularly among those with the most severe disease at the time of listing.

Quan<sup>1</sup>, N. Budanova<sup>1</sup>, M. Chavez<sup>1</sup>, K. Carmichael<sup>1</sup>, N. L. Ascher<sup>1</sup>, R. Hirose<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Francisco,Department Of Surgery, Division Of Transplantation,San Francisco, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Patients are overprescribed opioids after surgery; this contributes to opioid misuse and diversion. Kidney transplant recipients are prescribed excess opioids at discharge relative to their inpatient opioid requirements, and recipients who continue to fill prescriptions after transplant have an increased risk of death and graft loss. This study sought to examine the impact of a protocol that standardized discharge opioid prescriptions on discharge opioid amounts and outpatient refills in kidney transplant recipients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A discharge protocol was established at a&nbsp;high-volume transplant center: providers were asked to prescribe 0 pills to patients who required no opioids on the day prior to discharge, and 10 pills to those who required any opioids on the day prior. Chronic opioid users (n=44) were excluded. A retrospective chart review of recipients (March 2019-June 2020) was performed for demographic data, oral morphine equivalents (OME) on the day prior to discharge and at discharge, and outpatient refills. These data (Group 3) were compared to a historical cohort (Group 1), and a cohort who underwent a different opioid-reducing protocol (removal of patient-controlled analgesia pumps) (Group 2). Demographics were compared using descriptive statistics. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate predictors of OME at discharge. A subset of patients was surveyed at their first post-operative visit about their experience of pain.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 270 recipients were included: 80 in Group 1, 96 in Group 2, 94 in Group 3. With the protocol, there was a significant decrease in OME at discharge (mean 87.2 in Group 1, 62.8 in Group 2, 26.6 in Group 3, p&lt;0.001). The number of patients discharged on no opioids increased from 23.8% in Group 1, 37.5% in Group 2, to&nbsp;60.6% in Group 3 (p&lt;0.001). OME on the day prior to discharge did not significantly change. Lidocaine patch and acetaminophen use increased significantly (p&lt;0.001). Being a patient in Group 3, of Asian descent, and lower OME on the day of discharge were factors significantly associated with decreased OME at discharge. Length of stay was not a predictor. Twelve percent of Group 2 and 2% of Group 3 patients received an outpatient opioid refill (p=0.02). Forty-two patients were surveyed: 88.1% agreed that they had been educated about the risks of opioids preoperatively; 82.9% reported their pain was as expected or better during their hospital stay; 90.5% said their pain was as expected or better after discharge.



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;An opioid reduction protocol targeting discharge opioids dramatically reduced the amount of opioids prescribed; most patients received no opioids at discharge after the intervention. Non-opioid adjunct use increased, and outpatient opioid refills decreased. Patients felt appropriately educated and counselled regarding their pain. We recommend standardizing opioids at discharge in kidney transplant recipients, with the goal of not prescribing any opioids.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;From a large single-center registry, we compared 25 SOT vs 1718 non-SOT patients with valid COVID-19 diagnosis admitted 3/1/20-6/17/20. SOT status was identified through inpatient diagnosis records.&nbsp;We compared hospital length-of-stay (time to discharge) and inpatient mortality using Fine/Gray competing risks regression.&nbsp;We compared trajectories of the WHO ordinal COVID-19 severity scale between SOT vs non-SOT using mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression, adjusting for severity score at time of admission. We compared greatest severity of illness (highest WHO threshold achieved) using ordinal logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;SOT and non-SOT patients had comparable age (59 [51-66] vs. 60 [45-73]), sex (40% vs. 45% female), and race (Black 40% vs. 34%, Hispanic 28% vs. 25%). SOT recipients were more likely to have diabetes mellitus (72% vs. 35%), hypertension (88% vs. 55%), congestive heart failure (36% vs. 15%), and peripheral vascular disorders (28% vs. 8%)&nbsp;(all p&lt;0.01). Disease severity was comparable in the two groups upon admission (OR = <sub>0.26</sub> 0.55 <sub>1.17</sub>, p=0.12), though 7% of non-SOT and 0% of SOT required intubation immediately. SOT and non-SOT recipients had comparable maximum severity score (OR = <sub>0.36</sub> 0.73 <sub>1.46</sub>, p=0.4), length of stay (sHR = <sub>0.8</sub> 1.1 <sub>1.4</sub>, p=0.7), and mortality risk (2/25 vs 231/1718; sHR=<sub>0.1</sub> 0.6 <sub>2.4</sub>, p=0.5). SOT recipients had faster declining in&nbsp;severity over time (OR for increased severity over time: <sub>0.77</sub> 0.82 <sub>0.88</sub>, p&lt;0.001) (Figure), and shorter duration on oxygen therapy (3.7 [0.2-6.2] vs. 6.1 [2.4-12.5] days, p=0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;With proper management, history of SOT does not necessarily lead to worse COVID-19 outcomes. The trajectory of daily WHO ordinal scale demonstrates more rapid resolution of disease severity in SOT compared to non-SOT patients with COVID-19, with no evidence of increased mortality for SOT patients.&nbsp;

Locke<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Surgery/Transplantation,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Previous studies have demonstrated decreased transplant rates among poor performing transplant centers meeting Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) flagging criteria. However, no studies have examined the risk of waitlist mortality in liver candidates listed at a low performance transplant center. Thus, we sought to evaluate the impact of center flagging for poor outcomes and risk of waitlist mortality and transplant in a contemporary cohort of liver candidates.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;68,500 adult (&gt;18 years) liver-only candidates were listed between 06/18/13 to 12/21/17 in the SRTR. Flagging was defined using CMS criteria for 1-year patient and graft survival. Fine and Gray competing risk models in which flagging was a time-dependent variable were constructed to determine risk of waitlist mortality and likelihood of transplant associated with flagging after adjustment for factors contained in the SRTR waitlist mortality risk-adjustment model.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 123 centers evaluated, 28 (22.8%) were flagged at least once for low performance. Baseline demographics showed centers that were ever flagged had candidates that were more likely to be African American, Hispanic, and diabetic. After adjusting for demographics, flagging of a transplant center was found to be associated with 30% increased risk of waitlist mortality in liver candidates (adjusted HR (aHR): 1.30, 95%CI: 1.09-1.56). After accounting for the competing risks of waitlist mortality or removal from the waitlist, candidates were 15% less likely to be transplanted at a flagged center as compared to a non-flagged center (aHR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76-0.96, p=0.01) (Figure).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;These data suggest that centers became more conservative after being flagged, resulting in higher risk of waitlist mortality and decreased likelihood of transplant. Further research is needed to determine if there is a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations such as racial or ethnic minorities.

Toyoda<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Temple University,Cardiovascular Division/Department Of Surgery,Philadelpha, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic interstitial lung disease that primarily affects people over the age of 50 with a mean survival time of approximately 3 years after diagnosis. IPF accounts for the largest proportion of diagnoses on the US lung transplant (LTx) list. As the demand for donor lungs far exceeds the supply, finding effective sources of donor lungs has become increasingly important. While the average age of LTx recipients and donors continues to increase, the effect of donor age on survival in patients with IPF is poorly understood. Similarly, there is no clear consensus whether single LTx (SLT) or double LTx (DLT) is preferable in patients with IPF. This study analyzed the independent and combined effects of LTx type and donor age on survival outcomes in patients with IPF.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This study retrospectively assessed the survival outcomes of patients with IPF receiving LTx at a single institution over a period of 8 years (Feb-2012 to Mar-2020). Transplant recipients were grouped by SLT&nbsp;or DLT LTx&nbsp;type and donor lung age &lt;50 or 50&ge; years. Survival outcomes for each group were then measured using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and compared by log-rank test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Out of 742 LTx patients, 305 (41%) were diagnosed with IPF, of which 204 (67%) were SLT and 97 (32%) were DLT (the remaining 4 patients underwent either heart-lung transplant or single-sequential LTx). There was no significant difference in survival due to LTx type (p=0.368). Similarly, no significant difference in survival was found for patients with donor age &lt;50 or 50&ge; years (p=0.298). Of the grouped IPF diagnosed patients, there were 12 DLT and donor age 50&ge;, 35 SLT and donor age 50&ge;, 85 DLT and donor age &lt;50, and 169 SLT and donor age &lt;50. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference in survival between the four groups (p=0.455), though DLT and donor age 50&ge; had increased mean and median survival days comparatively.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

With ethical consideration for organ allocation, as the average age of the US population increases, donor lungs aged over 50 years are becoming an increasingly useful resource for LTx. Our findings at a single institution suggest that donor age and LTx type do not significantly affect survival outcomes. Therefore, SLT and donor lungs aged 50&ge; years ought to be more readily considered as non-inferior options for LTx in patients with IPF.&nbsp;

The more granular metric could increase risk aversion for high KDPI kidneys.&nbsp; Discard rates rose in the early post-KAS era and remain over 50% for KDPI&gt;85% kidneys. If high KDPI kidneys are increasingly discarded, this could cause a KDPI drift where kidneys with the same donor factors would translate to higher KDPI percentages over time resulting in perceptions of &ldquo;worse quality.&rdquo;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Using national United Network of Organ Sharing data, we compared deceased donor kidneys transplants (DDKT) alone according to era: 2010-2011 (pre-KDPI, &ldquo;Era 1&rdquo;), 2012-2013 (pre-KAS; KDPI reported but not implemented, &ldquo;Era 2&rdquo;), 2014-2015 (early post-KAS; &ldquo;Era 3&rdquo;), 2016-2017 (&ldquo;Era 4&rdquo;), and 2018-2020 (&ldquo;Era 5&rdquo;).&nbsp; We compared Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI; a composite estimate of relative risk of graft failure), KDPI (percentage normalizing the KDRI according to the prior year&rsquo;s donors), and the individual donor factors in each era.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;KDPI&gt;85% were 9.3% of DDKT in Era 1, but declined to 8.9, 7.6 and 7.1% after KDPI reporting in Eras 2, 3, and 4 before rebounding to 9.8% in Era 5 (p&lt;0.01). These time trends were reflected in both mean and median KDPI and KDRI (see Fig 1). Progressive decline through Era 1-4 with an increase in Era 5 occurred with donor age (&gt;60 years: 9.0, 8.0, 7.4, 6.7 and 8.4% in Eras 1-5 respectively, p&lt;0.01), diabetes (7.6, 7.9, 7.4, 6.7 and 8.0% in Eras 1-5, p&lt;0.01), and hypertension (29, 29, 27, 27 and 29% in Eras 1-5, p&lt;0.01). Donation after cardiac death (DCD) proportion (15, 17, 19, 21 and 26% in Eras 1-5, p&lt;0.01), terminal serum Creatinine (mean&plusmn;SD 1.14 &plusmn; 0.92, 1.15 &plusmn; 0.96, 1.19 &plusmn; 1.01, 1.25 &plusmn; 1.15 and 1.35 &plusmn; 1.29 in Eras 1-5, p&lt;0.01), and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) seropositivity (2.5, 2.2, 2.9, 3.9 and 8.9% in Eras 1-5, p&lt;0.01) progressively increased across each era.&nbsp; We analyzed KDPI and KDRI removing the HCV component given recent improvements in curative therapies and ability to delineate true viremia, but found that era trends remained the same.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Differences in high KDPI kidney utilization were noted initially after KDPI reporting began, but have rebounded in the most recent era.&nbsp; Trends were comparable in KDRI not supporting a drift .&nbsp; There has been sustained increase in the utilization of DCD, higher Cr, and HCV seropositive donors over time.&nbsp;

Panichella<sup>1</sup>, A. Di Carlo<sup>1</sup>, S. Karhadkar<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Temple University,Surgery,Philadelpha, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
With the advent of anti-retroviral therapy in the treatment of HIV, mortality in HIV-infected individuals has become less due to complications from viral infection and more due to chronic issues such as organ failure and dysfunction. Organ transplantation has thus become a viable therapeutic option to treat diabetes and renal failure in HIV+ patients. Although transplantations involving organs like livers and kidneys into HIV-infected individuals have become increasingly common over the past decade, pancreas transplantation into HIV+ recipients is rarely performed. This is despite the fact that type II diabetes and insulin resistance remain a large problem for this population.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using the UNOS database and SPSS, we examined the 31 incidences of pancreas transplantation that have occurred in HIV+ patients in the US. All of these transplantations were simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) procedures, with the first occurring in 2009 and the most recently recorded occurring in 2017.&nbsp;Subject characteristics were summarized using means and standard deviations or frequencies and percentages, as applicable. Significance between groups was determined by independent samples t-tests and &chi;<sup>2</sup>tests (&alpha; = 0.05.). Death-censored graft survival for various subgroups was estimated using Kaplan-Meier with Log-Rank to assess significance. All analysis was completed using SPSS Statistics 26.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Compared to SPK&nbsp;in HIV-uninfected individuals,&nbsp;pancreas graft function was similar (80.6% vs 85.3%), type I diabetes rates&nbsp;were similar (83.9% for HIV+ vs 87.4% for HIV-), and pancreas graft survival was higher (583 days for HIV+ vs 533&nbsp;days for HIV-). Similar rates of thymoglobulin induction were observed&nbsp;in both groups (54.8% for HIV+ vs 64.3% for HIV-), Simulect (22.6% vs 10.2%) and Rituxan&nbsp;(3.2% vs 0.7%) induction rates were higher in the HIV+ group. Reasons for&nbsp;pancreas graft failure in the HIV+ recipients included graft/vascular thrombosis (n = 1),&nbsp;anastomotic leak (n = 1), acute rejection (n = 2), and chronic rejection (n = 1), the graft/vascular thrombosis (3.2% vs 4.3%) and chronic rejection (3.2% vs 2.3%)&nbsp;occurred at a similar rate in the HIV+ and HIV- individuals, while the anastomic leak (3.2% vs&nbsp;0.3%) and acute rejection (6.5% vs 1.7%) occurred at higher levels in the HIV+ recipients.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Similar to outcomes seen in kidney&nbsp;transplantation, pancreas transplantation&nbsp;provides a viable therapeutic option for treatment of diabetes&nbsp;in HIV+ individuals. Ovrall survival of HIV+ SPK recipients was&nbsp;much lower than their HIV-uninfected counterparts (647 days for HIV+ vs 1059 days for HIV-), but the successes in both graft function and graft survival provide an optimistic outlook for&nbsp;SPK transplantation&nbsp;in this demographic.

However, applications of glycomic analysis in thyroid cancer are lacking. &nbsp;We aimed to evaluate the glycome of thyroid tissue to determine whether malignant and benign&nbsp;tissues are differentially glycosylated.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Fourteen tissue samples from&nbsp;seven patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) were identified from our institutional Endocrine Surgery Biorepository, which collects paired benign and malignant tissues from patients with biopsy-confirmed thyroid cancer undergoing total thyroidectomy. After tissue homogenization and trypsinization, N- and O-glycans in tryptic glycopeptides were enzymatically and chemically released, respectively.&nbsp; The released glycans were purified and permethylated prior to analysis by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MS). Reflective positive mode was used and a signal/noise ratio of at least 2 was considered. MS post-data acquisition analysis was made using mMass, and Student&rsquo;s t-test was used to compare relative abundances of N- and O-glycans, with p&lt;0.05 considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;All patients had pathologically confirmed PTC. Overall, cancer tissue exhibited N-glycans with higher masses and more complex structures. When compared to benign thyroid tissue, cancerous tissue exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of N-glycans containing extra HexNAc (e.g. GlcNAc and/or GalNAc) (20.3% vs. 7.0%, p=0.047). There were no significant differences in relative abundance of high-mannose type N-glycans (20.8% vs. 29.6%, p=0.16), fucosylated (62.5% vs. 57.6%, p=0.26) and sialylated N-glycans (43.1% vs. 43.8%, p=0.47). Regarding O-glycans, the relative abundance of unmodified core-2-based O-glycans was significantly higher in cancer tissue (26.2% vs. 12.8%, p=0.027). However, the overall sialylation level of O-glycans was lower in cancer tissue (66.9% vs. 83.5%, p=0.032). Specifically, the relative abundance of di-sialylated O-glycans was lower in cancer (37.9% vs. 58.0%, p=0.015) while mono-sialylated O-glycans was unchanged (28.7% vs. 25.0%, p=0.18).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our results demonstrate that there are profound and consistent N- and O-glycosylation differences between papillary thyroid cancer tissue and benign thyroid tissue. &nbsp;Further investigation of these glycans and their functional pathways will elucidate their roles in oncogenesis and neoplasia. Additionally these altered glycans may provide diagnostic value in identifying more indolent versus aggressive subtypes of thyroid cancer.&nbsp;

Marshall<sup>1</sup>, M. Nehs<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Brigham And Women's Hospital,Surgery,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare but devastating malignancy without effective current treatments. Glucose is an essential nutrient for cancer growth that is preferentially metabolized through the glycolysis pathway in tumor cells, even in the presence of oxygen (Warburg effect). Inhibition of glucose metabolism has been shown to have anti-tumor effects in various types of cancer. This study aims to determine if disruption of glucose availability in vitro and in vivo can suppress tumor cell growth and prolong survival in a mouse model of ATC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The human ATC cell line 8505C was cultured in medium containing high (25 mM) or low (3 mM) concentration of glucose. Cellular proliferation was determined using a standard BrdU assay. An orthotopic xenograft model of ATC was generated via injection of&nbsp;8505C cells into the thyroid glands of immunocompromised mice. Animals were subsequently provided with either standard chow diet (SD) (20% protein, 64% carbohydrate, 16% fat) or ketogenic diet (KD) (10% protein, 90% fat). SD control (N = 9) and KD treatment (N = 8) groups were monitored weekly for body weight and blood levels of glucose and ketones for up to 9 weeks. Tumors were harvested after animal death and measured using a digital caliper.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Proliferation of 8505C cells in vitro was significantly diminished in the low glucose setting (1.4 &plusmn; 0.1 vs 2.0&nbsp;&plusmn; 0.1 optical density units in high glucose medium; P = 0.01). Animals consuming KD had consistently higher blood ketone values throughout treatment compared to those given SD (1.5 &plusmn; 0.1 vs 0.7 &plusmn; 0.1 mM in week 4; P&nbsp;&lt; 0.01 for all weekly time points). Blood glucose levels were decreased in the KD treatment group during the initial 2 weeks of treatment (68 &plusmn; 4 vs 131 &plusmn; 5 mg/dL in week 2; P &lt; 0.01 for both time points), followed by normalization of glucose measurements to similar levels as SD controls for the remainder of the experiment. Mice in KD and SD groups exhibited similar rates of weight gain during the first 5 weeks of treatment, prior to the incidence of weight loss due to tumor burden. No difference in overall survival was observed in KD treatment and SD control groups (median survival 52 vs 53 days). Tumor sizes measured during necropsy were generally similar in KD and SD fed animals.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Glucose restriction alone significantly decreased in vitro growth of ATC but did not improve survival or reduce tumor size in an orthotopic murine model of ATC. This may be explained in part by the normalization of blood glucose values after an initial period of treatment in mice consuming a glucose restricted diet. Combination therapies including concomitant restriction of glucose intake along with pharmacologic inhibition of glucose metabolism may be more effective in the treatment of ATC and should be further studied.

Thyroid carcinomas are the most common endocrine malignancy. Though many patients respond to standard therapy and thyroidectomy, there&rsquo;s a subgroup of patients for whom that is not the case. Patients with aggressive or recurrent malignancies may develop tumors that de-differentiate, lose capacity of radioiodine uptake and often metastasize proving difficult to treat.&nbsp;Natural compounds remain one of the best sources for potential therapeutic agents.&nbsp;Piperlongumine (PL), a piper amide produced by pepper plants, has been shown to have anticancer properties against breast, colorectal, renal, bladder and prostate cancer cells.&nbsp;The purpose of this study was to explore the anticancer therapeutic efficacy of piperlongumine in anaplastic thyroid cancer and H&uuml;rthle cell carcinoma&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;andin vivo.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Anaplastic (THJ-16T) and H&uuml;rthle cell (XTC.UC1) thyroid cancer cell lines were treated with PL. A neutral red assay was used to determine the IC50 values for all cell lines. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation after PL treatment was assessed by using a 2&prime;,7&prime;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe on cells pre-treated or not with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Immunofluorescent analysis was used to visualize cell damage after PL treatment. Additionally, nude mice were used to establish subcutaneous xenografts of both XTC.UC1 and THJ-16T. Mice were treated with piperlongumine at 2.5 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg IP and compared to a vehicle control group. Lastly, a metastatic model consisting of IV injection of THJ-16T cells was also treated with PL.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
PL demonstrated an IC50 of&nbsp;3.08 uM against THJ-16T and&nbsp;2.36 uM&nbsp;against XTC.UC1 cell lines. Immunofluorescence analysis of PL treated cells revealed increased nuclear instability in a dose dependent manner. The DCFH-DA probe showed ROS formation in a dose dependent manner in cells treated with PL. Additionally, treatment with NAC, an ROS scavenger, prevented PL induced cell death. The&nbsp;in vivo&nbsp;study demonstrated a 55 &ndash; 60% reduction in tumor burden for XTC.UC1 and THJ-16T xenografts treated with PL when compared to controls. Lastly, the THJ-16T metastatic mouse model exhibited a 25% increase in survival for mice treated with PL compared to our control mice.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

PL suppresses proliferation in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells and H&uuml;rthle cell carcinoma cells&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;by inducing ROS. Furthermore,&nbsp;in vivo&nbsp;studies using mice xenografts and metastatic models showed decreased tumor burden and increased survival in mice treated with PL. Our results suggest this naturally derived compound may be a promising therapeutic agent&nbsp;to treat patients with aggressive or recurrent thyroid cancers.&nbsp;

Type II Diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance in peripheral adipocytes. Treatment is complicated by poor compliance and stigma. Natural remedies are increasingly popular among patients. The botanicals Alma, Olive, Rosemary, Gotu Kola, Bitter Melon, and Artichoke attenuate lipid accumulation consistent with the Thiazolidinediones (TZD) class, which acts through agonism of the transcription factor PPAR&gamma;. Sumac was reported to possess insulin sensitizing effects in vivo. In this preclinical study,&nbsp; the effect of these traditional remedies on expression of genetic markers for insulin resistance was investigated.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Aqueous extracts were derived from Alma, Olive, Rosemary, Artichoke, Gotu Kola, Bitter Melon, and Sumac. Toxicity was assessed using cell viability assays for 48 and 72 hours. Adipocytes were generated from murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using treatment for 2 days with dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and insulin, and then followed by insulin alone for another 5 days. Adipocytes were treated with aqueous extracts starting on day 2. Oil Red O staining procedure followed by elution and spectrophotometric measurement was used to quantify the effect of extracts on lipid accumulation. Expression of genetic markers for insulin resistance and adipogenesis was measured using RT-PCR. The effects of the aqueous extracts were compared to the antidiabetic drug Rosiglitazone.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
No effect on 3T3-L1 proliferation was observed following treatment with the aqueous extracts from Olive, Gotu Kola, Bitter Melon, or Sumac (0.0-1.0 mg/mL). The extracts from Alma, Rosemary, and Artichoke decreased proliferation of 3T3-L1 cells at the concentration of 1.0 mg/mL at 48 and 72 hours. The extracts did not lead to significant changes in lipid accumulation (P&gt;0.05). Plant extracts and Rosiglitazone significantly downregulated mRNA expression of adiponectin, perilipin, FABP4, and CD36. Attenuation of adiponectin expression ranged from 6.0x10<sup>-2</sup>&plusmn;4.3x10<sup>-4</sup> to 50.3&plusmn;8.7x10<sup>-1</sup> (Percent Change &plusmn; SE). Percent Change in perilipin expression was between 4.0&plusmn;2.0x10<sup>-1</sup> and 18.9&plusmn;1.7. Percent Change in FABP4 expression was between 4.9&plusmn;3.5x10<sup>-1</sup> and 16.9&plusmn;1.5. Percent Change in CD 36 expression was between 6.0<sup>-1</sup>&plusmn;4.3x10<sup>-4</sup> and 51.2&plusmn;1.4.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Downregulation of genetic markers for insulin resistance and adipogenesis were observed for all extracts tested, verifying their antidiabetic activity. Increases in markers of adipogenesis is consistent with the fatty acid steal hypothesis proposed for TZDs. Future investigation should investigate the effect of these compounds on the expression of upstream transcription factors. The inhibitory concentrations should also be determined to facilitate comparisons of efficacy. Given the safety, demonstrable mechanism, and patient interest in these botanicals, practitioners should maintain an open mind to their therapeutic usage.

However, their survival dramatically decreases with soft tissue or lymph node involvement or distant metastatic spread. Tumor progression anchored in tumor metabolism and its modulation of the tumor-infiltrating immune phenotype in the PTC tumor microenvironment (TME) remains largely understudied. The purpose of our study was to explore the immuno-metabolic impact of the citric acid (TCA) cycle metabolism in TME immune landscape and patient survival.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;To examine TCA cycle metabolism in PTC, we performed targeted and untargeted metabolomics on PTC samples (20 untargeted, 10 targeted) and unrelated benign controls (8 untargeted, 9 targeted). To characterize the TME immuno-metabolic landscape of PTC, we generated a TCA cycle metabolic enzyme gene list using KEGG pathway and performed RNA sequencing analysis of 20 PTC samples to further&nbsp;correlate differential immunogenomic and metabolic enzyme gene expressions in the PTC TME. We used 2 different computational deconvolution platforms, TIMER2.0 (Tumor Immune Estimation Resource) and CibersortX, to correlate enzymatic and immune expression patterns. Significantly correlated TCA metabolic genes expressions and immune cell types were then analyzed for their impact on overall patient survival using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, PTC=500 samples) program.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Untargeted metabolomics revealed key alterations in the TCA cycle and targeted metabolic flux studies &nbsp;demonstrated atom percent enrichment of TCA cycle metabolites with significant enrichment of citrate in tumor samples when compared to controls. Mass isotopomer of citrate demonstrated a lower M+4/M+5 ratio in tumor samples, indicative of forward movement of TCA cycle and a component of active reductive carboxylation of &alpha;-ketoglutarate (&alpha;-KG) to citrate for biosynthetic purposes. Our immunogenomic profiling of sequenced PTC tumors identified significant correlations between TCA cycle metabolic gene expressions and higher recruitment of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes.&nbsp; TCGA analysis of the PTC TME&nbsp;immune landscape showed that BRAF mutations, which confer a worse prognosis, were associated with significantly increased infiltrate levels of B cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells compared to wild-type BRAF tumors. TCGA analysis of impact of all TCA metabolic genes on patient survival identified ACO1, SUCLG1, and SDHC genes to be associated with worse overall survival.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;We observed key TCA cycle metabolite differences and a strong correlative relationship between metabolic enzyme gene and immune cell expressions in the PTC tumor microenvironment. Exploiting the complex interplay of tumor metabolism and its modulation of the immune landscape will provide new insights for emerging prognostic markers and future therapeutic targets in tumor progression and treatment of advanced PTC.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Saleh<sup>1</sup>, G. K. Gittes<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Children's Hospital Of Pittsburgh Of UPMC,Pediatric Surgery,Pittsburgh, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Currently, 10.5% of the US population has diabetes mellitus (DM), the 7th leading cause of death. Type 1 DM is an autoimmune disease that results in a loss of beta-cell mass. In contrast, type 2 DM is marked by insulin resistance, which causes a loss of beta-cell mass and subsequent beta cell dysfunction. Both populations have insulin deficiency. Gene therapy may treat DM by reprogramming alpha-cells into new beta-like-cells via forced expression of specific transcription factors: pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein-1 (Pdx1) and V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A (mafA). In toxin-induced and autoimmune genetic diabetic mouse models, a pancreatic intraductal infusion of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-CMV-Pdx1-mafA resulted in the formation of new beta-like-cells and normoglycemia. Moving forward, we aimed to replicate these results in a toxin-induced diabetes model in NHPs using a similar construct.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Administration of streptozocin&nbsp;induces diabetes in NHPs by ablating the pancreatic beta cells. After an acclimation period and confirmation of diabetes, we proceed with surgery. We make a midline laparotomy, clamp the common bile duct, make a duodenotomy, cannulate the Ampulla of Vater, clamp the minor duct; pancreatography ensures cannulation of the common channel without spillage into the duodenum or flow into the common bile duct beyond the clamp. Upon completion of the infusion, we allow the virus to dwell for ten minutes. We then remove the clamps and the catheter and close the enterotomy, followed by closure of the laparotomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Over time, the NHPs required less insulin (see attached figure) and had increased c-peptide compared to their preoperative baseline, with some NHPs being nearly insulin-independent. Three separate NHPs underwent glucose tolerance testing (GTT) after streptozocin administration and then after the AAV infusion.&nbsp; The GTT demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the glucose homeostasis after intraductal infusion by 2-way ANOVA (p&lt; 0.01). Immunohistochemistry revealed positive insulin, glucagon, and amylase staining, suggesting the formation of new insulin-producing-cells and normal exocrine tissue.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The newly formed beta-like-cells can produce insulin and provide long term replacement of beta-cells. Thus, this targeted gene therapy may be a promising treatment for diabetes and easily translate to humans via ERCP.&nbsp;

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are the second most common pancreatic malignancy. Many patients present with metastatic disease and current therapy options for advanced disease are rarely curative. Inhibitors of the mTOR pathway improve progression-free survival in patients with advanced PNETs, but many patients eventually develop resistance and recurrence.&nbsp;We have found that PNET cells highly express protein kinase D-1 (PKD-1), a signaling protein that plays a critical role in the maintenance of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs).&nbsp;Previous studies have shown that CD36 can regulate fatty acid metabolism in CSCs to promote disease progression and that ALDH1A1 is involved in CSC plasticity. We hypothesize that the plasticity of CSCs contributes to drug resistance in PNETs through PKD-1 signaling.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;

To test this hypothesis, we generated drug-resistant PNET cells through continual treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.&nbsp;To define the molecular mechanisms by which PKD-1 signaling regulates CSC features, we inhibited PKD-1 pathway pharmacologically and genetically and determined the expression of CSC-associated genes using cellular and molecular approaches. Tumorsphere assays were used to elucidate mechanisms by which PKD-1 signaling regulates CSC function.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Drug-resistant PNET cells significantly increased the expression of CSC markers: CD133, CD24, and ALDH1A1, along with the stemness-associated genes: CD36, Notch1, and Zeb1.&nbsp;In the meantime, PKD-1 expression was also significantly increased. However, inhibition of PKD-1 signaling was able to abolish LPA-induced expression of ALDH1A1, CD133, CD24, Notch1, and CD36. Moreover, knocking down endogenous PKD-1 expression significantly impaired the self-renewal potential of BON cells.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our study indicates that PKD-1 signaling may regulate the phenotype of CSCs in PNETs, promoting resistance to mTOR inhibition via modulation of metabolic plasticity of CSCs. Targeting PKD-1 signaling should provide insights into therapeutic strategies against drug resistance and cancer recurrence in PNETs.

During trauma, this BBB integrity can become compromised from direct brain injury, shock, or remote tissue injury. We hypothesize that there are specific genomic drivers of signaling pathways that directly affect the integrity of the BBB following severe injury.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Human cerebral endothelial cells and/or astrocytes were grown as monocultures or as co-cultures to replicate the BBB in vitro. The cultures were then incubated for 4hours with trauma plasma ex vivo from severely injured(ISS&gt;15) and shocked(BD&lt;-6) patients. RNA samples were prepared and sent for sequencing for RNAseq analysis. Sequence reads were processed with previously published protocols and significant gene lists were used for downstream pathway analysis.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Plasma from severely injured and/or shocked patients induced changes in cell signaling depending if the cells were grown in mono-or co-cultures. The astrocyte monoculture had increased downstream signaling responsible for neutrophil extravasation from the vasculature, while the endothelial monoculture exhibited increased signaling involved in proliferation of endothelial progenitor cells and the migration of connective tissue(Figure1). When grown in co-culture, there was increased signaling responsible for endothelial cell maturation and angiogenesis. Lastly, the plasma elicited activation of NUPR1 transcription factor, which is directly involved in the response to cell stress in all cell cultures and could be a key mediator in the initiation and propagation of the response to traumatic stress.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Cell signaling pathways in an in vitro model of the BBB are distinctly different from the individual component monocultures. Crucial signals that are transmitted within and between the astrocytes and endothelium to maintain the integrity of the BBB during traumatic stress. Future studies will focus on enumeration of transcriptional changes and the inherent signaling cascades induced by severe injury and shock phenotypes.

Here we hypothesize that within-group mortality differences following IP injection of Serratia marcescens are dependent on peritoneal macrophage phenotype transition during infection.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: C57/B6 wild type mice were subjected to IP Serratia Marcescens at an LD<sub>60</sub>.&nbsp; Body temperature was used to track the progression from infection to sepsis in addition to a 6 component sepsis score between 0-3 based on appearance, level of consciousness, activity, response to stimulus, eyes, and respiratory status. To define the role of macrophages in the LD60 response, macrophages were depleted with IP clodronate liposomes. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated using magnetic bead isolation. RNA was extracted from isolated peritoneal macrophages and RT-PCR was used to determine gene expression of M1 versus M2 specific genes.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Survivors and non-survivors were clearly delineated by a reduction in their temperature (24.7&deg;C v 30.7&deg;C: non-survivor vs survivors, p &lt; 0.01) and an increase in their sepsis score (13.9 v 2.0: non-survivor vs survivors, p &lt; 0.01).&nbsp; When mice were pretreated with clodronate liposomes, the LD60 dose of SM increased to 100% demonstrating that macrophages are required for survival. Comparison of macrophages gene expression between surviving and non-surviving mice demonstrated a significant increase in expression of M1, pro-inflammatory genes (IL-6, TNF, and NOS2) in the non-surviving mice.&nbsp; The macrophages from surviving mice had a significant increase in ARG1 expression compared to macrophages from non-surviving mice (P&lt;0.05). The increase in NOS2 and reduction in ARG1 seen in non-surviving peritoneal macrophages is likely a reflection of an increased M1 phenotype compared to M2.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In this study, presence of macrophages and their ability to appropriately transition from the inflammatory, M1 phenotype, to a pro-resolving, M2, macrophage phenotype discriminated between those that survived versus died following IP Serratia marcescen administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;

However, prolonged endoaortic occlusion contributes to morbidity and mortality due to distal ischemia reperfusion. Targeted regional optimization (TRO) describes a partial REBOA strategy with active compartmentalization of central aortic and cerebral pressure optimization, and regional subdiaphragmatic hypotension while maintaining targeted distal perfusion. This technique strikes the balance between hemostasis and tissue perfusion. Using the next-generation REBOA catheter, this study characterized the hemodynamics at specific targeted distal flow rates in a swine model of uncontrolled hemorrhage.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Anesthetized swine (68.6&plusmn;0.9 kg) were subjected to uncontrolled hemorrhage initiated by liver laceration. Animals were randomized into 3 groups with TRO established at 300 (n=5), 500 (n=5) or 700 ml/min (n=4). Following a 90-min TRO phase, the animals received damage control perihepatic packing and were subsequently monitored for 6 hours (ICU phase). Pressor/fluids were provided to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP)&gt;55 mmHg. Hemodynamic parameters (flow rates at common carotid artery, renal artery and suprarenal aorta distal to the endoaortic balloon;&nbsp;and MAP at common carotid and femoral arteries) were measured continuously.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During TRO phase, distal aortic flow rates in all groups were tightly regulated and average percent deviation from the targeted flow was -0.54% for TRO300, -2.30% for TRO500, and -3.34% for TRO700. Femoral MAP in the TRO500 group was significantly higher than in the other 2&nbsp;groups (p&lt;0.001; TRO500=38.8&plusmn;0.3 mmHg; TRO700=34.9&plusmn;0.4 mmHg; TRO300=31.3&plusmn;0.3 mmHg). Carotid flow rates gradually decreased during TRO phase, in which the flow rate trended lower in the TRO700 group. Carotid MAP remained supraphysiologic in the TRO300 group (109.2&plusmn;0.3mmHg), whereas it was dampened and more physiologic at higher TRO (p&lt;0.05; TRO500=97.9&plusmn;0.5mmHg; TRO700=95.9&plusmn;0.2mmHg). Renal flow rate was comparable between groups during TRO phase. Aortic and carotid flow rates decreased gradually during the initial ICU phase and reached a plateau at 1.5 hours. No differences in flow parameters were detected between groups. TRO700 group had a slightly lower femoral and carotid MAP than TRO300 and TRO500. TRO500 yielded the lowest renal flow rate among the 3 groups during ICU phase, but the differences did not reach statistical significance.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study demonstrated technical feasibility of TRO at multiple targeted distal flow rates. With next-generation REBOA, flow past the endoaortic balloon can be precisely and accurately regulated with great fidelity to achieve TRO as a resuscitative strategy in the setting of hemorrhagic shock. Higher TRO (500 or 700 mL/min) resulted in less supraphysiological proximal blood pressure.

Hemorrhage is a leading cause of death after trauma. Development of therapies to slow or stop bleeding after injury could help reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. Our goal is to develop an injectable therapy that targets specifically to sites of injury to deliver a prothrombotic agent. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated successful targeting to the site of bleeding using peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofibers that are targeted to tissue factor (TF). The goal of the current study is to design, synthesize, and characterize TF-targeted PA nanofibers that incorporate prothrombotic therapeutic options.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

PA molecules were synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with purity assessed by LC-mass spectrometry (LCMS). We co-assembled four TF-targeted PA nanofibers at previously successful targeting molar ratios with the maximum amount of backbone PA conjugated to one of two therapeutics: TXA and RGDS peptide. A polyethylene glycol spacer was added between the therapeutic and the PA to ensure the therapeutic did not interfere with nanofiber formation while remaining accessible to clotting factors in the blood. To confirm nanofiber formation, we performed both conventional and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in Hank&rsquo;s balanced salt solution (HBSS) and HBSS with serum, respectively. To characterize secondary structure within the nanofibers, we used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. To confirm nanofiber formation at proposed in vivo administration doses, we assessed critical aggregation concentration (CAC) using a Nile Red assay.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

PA molecules were &gt;95% pure as assessed by LCMS. Co-assemblies of all four TF-targeted PA nanofibers containing either prothrombotic agent were noted to form nanofibers by conventional TEM and this was confirmed by cryogenic TEM for six of the eight nanofibers. Characterization by CD spectroscopy showed expected peaks consistent with &alpha;-helix and &beta;-sheet formation. Additionally, CAC measurements demonstrated that the TF-targeted PA nanofibers containing a prothrombotic agent formed fibers at concentrations ranging from 46.6&plusmn;2.5 to 72.2&plusmn;4.6 &micro;M. These concentrations are 17-fold lower than the injection dose, indicating that these TF-targeted prothrombotic nanofibers will retain their shape when administered in vivo.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

We successfully designed, synthesized, and co-assembled four TF-targeted PA nanofibers with two prothrombotic moieties and demonstrated nanofiber formation in buffer and serum at the proposed dose for in vivo testing. In the future, we plan to characterize the prothrombotic activity of each nanotherapeutic in vitro and ultimately test our most successful TF-targeted therapeutic nanofibers in vivo in our established rat liver hemorrhage model.

Hypertrophic scar (HTS), a common complication of burn injury, has few prevention and treatment options due to a poor understanding of its pathogenesis. Fibroblast dysfunction leading to excessive collagen deposition has been implicated in scar formation and severity, however&nbsp;dermal microvascular endothelial cells&nbsp;(DMVECs) may also play an important role because of endothelial dysfunction&rsquo;s (EnD) well-studied role in trauma and acute burn injury. Previous studies of HTS have shown partially or totally occluded vessels and local tissue hypoxia, which contributes to scar severity.&nbsp;This study uses immunofluorescence to determine microvasculature area&nbsp;density&nbsp;of normal skin vs HTS and a primary cell culture model&nbsp;to identify permeability in normal DMVECs and HTS DMVECs.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
In a Duroc pig model, full thickness excisional wounds were created and formed HTS by day 98. Biopsies taken on day 0, representing normal skin, and day 98 scar were stained for smooth muscle actin. Immunofluorescence was used to identify microvasculature area&nbsp;density.&nbsp;Fibroblast?DMVEC co?cultures were derived from regions of normal skin and HTS. Each co-culture was positively sorted using magnetic activated cell sorting for microvascular cells with ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 lectin and negatively sorted for fibroblasts, creating a monoculture of DMVECs.&nbsp;Normal DMVECs and HTS DMVECs were cultured separately in transwell inserts to form confluent monolayers as determined by trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values&nbsp;&gt;30&Omega;. On day 5, cell injury was induced in 2 of the 4 plates with 1&micro;M Epinephrine and 1mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp;Permeability was then assessed in each plate by applying&nbsp;a 40kDa FITC-dextran tracer in the apical well and measuring tracer diffusion across the monolayer via fluorescence spectroscopy. Average&plusmn;SEM are presented with statistical significance determined by&nbsp;Student&rsquo;s t-test with p-values &lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
HTS had an increased area density of dermal microvasculature compared to normal skin (169.6&nbsp;&plusmn; 20.5 vs 106.2&nbsp;&plusmn; 10.4 vessels/mm<sup>2</sup>; p=0.03).&nbsp;Using a permeability index, HTS DMVECs without injury were 17.59% less permeable than normal DMVECs (p=0.002) to 40kDa FITC-dextran. After injury, normal DMVECs were 28.4% and HTS DMVECs were 18.8% more permeable than uninjured controls (28.4 &plusmn; 4.8 vs 18.8 &plusmn; 2.8; p=0.11).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
HTS has more blood vessels than normal skin and HTS DMVECs have decreased permeability in an in-vitro permeability assay. After injury, both normal and HTS DMVECs are more permeable than their respective baseline measurements, however HTS DMVECs have a dampened response compared to normal DMVECs. This data supports that EnD plays a role in scar pathology because HTS DMVECs have both a discordant response to cellular insults and baseline differences in function.&nbsp;

Accurate fluid replacement is associated with decreased 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality, whereas inadequate resuscitation can lead to systemic hypoperfusion and its sequelae and excessive resuscitation can result in pulmonary edema and increased ventilator requirements. While vital signs and central hemodynamic indices are used to guide fluid administration during surgery, there is a paucity of data regarding how these parameters change over the spectrum of volume states in the perioperative period.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An adult porcine model of controlled hemorrhage and volume overload resuscitation was used to continuously record vital signs: heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse pressure (PP), and pulse pressure variation (PPV); and central hemodynamic indices: mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output (CO), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). Blood was removed from a series of 8 adult pigs to a total of 400mL [representing 10-15% of total blood volume (class 1 hemorrhage)] and vital signs and central hemodynamic measurements were obtained after each 100mL of volume loss. Hemorrhaged volume was returned to restore euvolemia, then crystalloid was infused up to 2,500mL with vital signs and central hemodynamic measurements obtained after each 500mL infused. Linear correlations (R<sup>2</sup>) of the means of values from all 8 pigs at each of the volume states were determined.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During hemorrhage, HR had little correlation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.22) with bled volume, while SBP, DBP, MAP, PP and PPV all demonstrated linear conformity with a R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.80, and all central hemodynamic indices demonstrated linearity with a R<sup>2</sup>&ge;0.98. During resuscitation, all vital signs demonstrated a linear correlation with a R<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.800 and central hemodynamic indices, MPAP (R<sup>2</sup>=0.89), PCWP (R<sup>2</sup>=0.98), CVP (R<sup>2</sup>=0.93) and CO (R<sup>2</sup>=0.95) also demonstrated strong linear correlations. PCWP demonstrated the strongest linear correlation of any other parameter in detecting changes in both hemorrhage and volume overload (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study confirms the superiority of central hemodynamic indices, particularly PCWP, relative to vital signs, in quantifying fluid status during hemorrhage and volume overload resuscitation. However, intraoperative use of PCWP is cumbersome, invasive, and may pose high and unnecessary risk to the patient. Thus, there remains a clinical need for a non-invasive, PCWP-equivalent surrogate for perioperative fluid management.

Cardin<sup>1</sup>, J. J. Glaser<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Naval Medical Research Unit San Antonio,Expeditionary & Trauma Medicine,San Antonio, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Currently, limited animal models for testing human-derived blood products (HDBP) exist due to xenocompatability issues. Old World non-human primates (NHP) are considered physiologically, immunologically, and genetically most similar to humans, generating interest as a potential animal model for testing blood-based resuscitation strategies. Ensuring compatibility with a pre-clinical animal model is necessary for clinical translatability. We investigated the xenocompatability of rhesus macaques with HDBPs following polytraumatic hemorrhagic shock.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Six adult male Chinese rhesus macaques were randomized into three treatment groups: 1. Human AB+ platelet-rich-plasma (PRP; n=2), 2. Human O negative whole blood (WB; n=2), and 3. Crystalloid (Lactated Ringer&rsquo;s Solution - LRS; n=2). Baseline serum samples were collected from the subjects prior to the initiation of decompensated hemorrhagic shock. The serum and HDBPs were used for gel agglutination crossmatch and immediate spin tests. The in-vivo polytrauma model of pressure targeted and decompensated shock model was utilized.&nbsp; &nbsp;After decompensation (T0), the designated pre-hospital resuscitation fluid was administered. At T60, all groups entered a simulated hospital phase with resuscitation, injury repair, and observation. After removal from anesthesia (T180), animals underwent continual observation for 24 hours (T1440) from end of shock. Survival time, complete blood cell counts, chemistries, and arterial blood gas parameters were analyzed. Statistical significance was determined by t-test and one-way ANOVA (p&lt;0.05).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The gel agglutination and immediate spin tests demonstrated a 1+ agglutination in one of four PRP units and in both WB units administered. There were no significant differences in survival time between the three groups (PRP: 1319min, WB: 1440min, LRS: 1440min; p=0.46). Hemoglobin (HGB) and hematocrit (HCT) remained higher in the WB group compared to PRP and LRS group from T30 (HGB: 11.5g/dL v. 5.9, 8.7; p=0.020 and HCT: 36.05% v. 17.15, 25.85; p=0.017) through T180 (HGB: 12.35g/dL v. 8.45, 9.75; p=0.016 and HCT: 38.20% v. 24.55, 29.00; p=0.009). There were no significant differences in ALT or AST. At T60, total bilirubin (tBili) levels were significantly increased in both WB and PRP group compared to LRS (0.50mg/dL, 0.45 v. 0.10; p=0.04). There were no significant differences in potassium or pH levels between the groups.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In-vitro results demonstrated slight agglutination with HDBPs and rhesus macaques in parallel in-vivo studies showed limited acute reactions. This preliminary study suggests there are no clinically significant xenocompatibility issues nor adverse short term outcomes in this model, supporting its use for human whole blood preclinical investigations. Further xenocompatibility validation in this NHP model with human-derived blood therapeutics should occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;

TBI is a chronic disorder resulting from a heterogenous mechanical insult to the brain. This mechanical insult initiates a biochemical cascade of pathophysiological complications such as edema and neuroinflammation which severely impacts patient outcomes. Current experimental in vitro models attempt to mimic the complex pathophysiology of TBI, but often neglect the hemodynamic parameters that recapitulate in vivo TBI leading to a poor Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) phenotype. The development of a suitable in vitro TBI model will mimic pathogenesis by sequentially imposing the mechanical, metabolic, and inflammatory insults in a functional BBB in a high-throughput platform. This platform will allow for the independent modulation of the brain and blood compartments&rsquo; hydraulic forces, perfusion rates, and biochemical environments that have been neglected in previous models. Based on these parameters, we engineered a modular, dynamic platform around a Matrigel<sup>?</sup> coated Transwell<sup>?</sup> membrane. Our novel TBI platform utilized key BBB cellular components such as brain microvascular endothelial cells, astrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (pericytes) arranged into either a direct contact coculture or triculture system.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Cellular layers were exposed to either a combination of Wall Shear Stress (WSS) (average of 4 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup>), and/or biochemical insult of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a, 5 ng/ml) or Cytochalasin-D (cD, 2.5 ug/ml). To mimic conditions of TBI, cellular layers were also exposed to an oxygen-glucose depleted environment followed by reperfusion (OGD/R). Transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), FITC-Dextran extravasation (1, 7, &amp; 15 kDa), and tight junction&nbsp; immunofluorescence were used as validation markers of a BBB phenotype.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Our results indicate that shear stress resulted in the enhancement of and maintenance of BBB phenotype through enhanced TEER in comparison to static condition in both the coculture and triculture BBB system. The triculture system achieved BBB characteristics including TEER up to 510 ? cm<sup>2</sup> and a permeability coefficient (P<sub>app</sub>) of 2.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup> in 10 kDa FITC-dextran. Treatment with inflammatory insults TNF-a and cD caused a decrease in TEER over time, confirming the BBB phenotype of paracellular tightness. Glucose starvation with oxygen deprivation caused a decrease in TEER of the coculture system at the 2 hr timepoint and eventually recovered 4 hr after this metabolic insult.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our findings suggest that our in vitro TBI platform is capable of initiating and/or enhancing the BBB phenotype over time to relevant in vivo characteristics. The goal in the development of our novel in vitro TBI platform is the potential refinement of current in vivo experiments, as well as the enhanced translation of preclinical results into clinically meaningful neuroprotective strategies for the future.&nbsp;

Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are an integral part of innate immunity through eradication of pathogens and are key mediators in ARDS and multiple organ failure post-injury. Priming of PMNs causes adherence to the vascular endothelium and hyper-reactivity, such that agents that usually do not activate the respiratory burst cause PMN activation and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), endothelial damage, and organ injury. Severe injury causes the release of many potential mediators which may act as a first event including circulating bradykinin (BK); and a second insult, such as bacterial infection, reperfusion injury, etc., will activate these primed PMNs, releasing ROS. We hypothesize that BK primes PMNs and a BK antagonist (HOE140) will inhibit&nbsp;priming.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 


PMNs were isolated from whole blood from healthy volunteers. PMNs were incubated with 31.2-1000 ng/ml of BK for 5 min at 37<sup>&nbsp;&ordm;&nbsp;</sup>C, and activated with 1 &mu;M fMLF. Priming, augmentation of the fMLF-activated respiratory burst, was measured by the maximal rate of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&ndash;&nbsp;</sup>production by cytochrome C reduction. Pre-incubation with HOE140, a bradykinin receptor antagonist, followed by BK stimulation, assessed for inhibition. Statistical differences were determined via an ANOVA (p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:


Compared to vehicle controls BK primed PMNs at all tested concentrations (p=0.013), which was inhibited by HOE140 (81.4&plusmn;33.3%) at the highest concentrations.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:


Severe injury causes the release of mediators, such as BK, priming PMNs and predisposing the patient to ARDS and MOF post-injury. BK, a component of the coagulation cascade, induces activation of innate immunity providing evidence for crosstalk between it and the coagulation system. This data also suggests HOE140 may be useful in inhibiting kininopathy caused by BK.

Cockrell<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Vermont College Of Medicine / Fletcher Allen Health Care,Surgery,Burlington, VT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The process of wound healing after a Volumetric Muscle Loss (VML) injury is broadly characterized by extensive phases of degeneration, repair, and remodeling, culminating in fibrosis within the injured muscle and within surrounding tissues. In typical muscle repair, both the innate and adaptive immune response play a role in this healing through upregulation of genes expressed by M1 and M2 macrophages as well as CD4+ and CD8+ helper T cells. These genes, expressed as cytokine markers, can be used to characterize the extent of the immune response. Currently, quantifying the cytokine profile at a specific location in a wound requires the excision of tissue for subsequent analysis, a process which disturbs the wound and alters the future wound healing dynamics. In this work, we utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze wound images pre-biopsy in order to regress the relative up or down-regulation of the gene expression for TGF&beta; in order to elucidate phases of wound healing without disturbing tissue.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We have obtained a set of images of volumetric muscle loss injuries in a canine model. Tissue biopsies are samples from each of these injuries in a spatial grid over the injury. We have isolated a set of 81x81 pixel images of the biopsied tissue prior to its excision and subsequent analysis. We then annotate/label these images with the associated TGF&beta; expression (measured in pg/mg of tissue) at that specific site in the wound. We then regress the expression in TGF&beta; as a function of the pixels in the image (color and spatial distribution) using a CNN.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The CNN is able to establish both relative relationships between the spatial concentrations of TGF&beta; in the same wound (e.g., TGF&beta; concentrations are greater at the wound edge than wound center), as well as accurate (within 10%) estimates of TGF&beta; expression in the global training set of pre-biopsy tissue images.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This project lays the groundwork for further research into the uses of image regression in analyzing other types of medical images. Of specific use to the area of surgery, CNNs, with the ability to recognize the levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels explored in this project, would be able to determine the stage of repair or disrepair in a VML wound, giving healthcare professionals a new perspective in clinical decision-making. Future experiments would be aimed at the sophistication of this workflow, with hopes that we can enhance the utility of CNNs for adoption in real clinical practice.

Patient reported outcomes are becoming increasingly important in surgical quality in healthcare projects. There has been a continuing decline in health-related survey responses in the last 30 years, with most published data claiming between 20-60% response rates. A 75% response rate has been deemed necessary to ensure validity in a study; a very difficult target to reach. We have sought to design a methodology to increase the response rate of patient phone surveys using unblocked numbers and text messages for a quality in healthcare project.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
For our project, patients were contacted via unblocked mobile phones one week after discharge from hospital. They were not made aware that they would be contacted for the project. If contact was not made after two consecutive phone calls on the same day, a text message was sent to the patient explaining the rationale for the call. If still no response by the following day, patients were then called once again with the same number. We recorded our response rate including at which stage in the method it occurred. The survey itself was always conducted via a call and could not be completed through text message.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We attempted contact of 1112 patients. Though our method we achieved an 83.7% response rate. 74% of the patients responded to the first attempt at contact. A further 9.7% of patients were recaptured using text messaging and a call the following day. Of the 181 patients who did not participate the in study, 20 of them answered the call but did not wish to participate.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
With this method, we were able to achieve a superior response rate of 83.7%. At our institution, patients are routinely called the day after discharge with a blocked number which achieves a response rate of 20-50%. We believe our high response rate can be contributed to two main factors: firstly due to the unblocked number which allows patients to directly return a missed call and may increase the likelihood of answering, and secondly the text messages which notifies the patients of the reason for the call, serving as a less intrusive method of communication. We have demonstrated the effectiveness in our centre for achieving a response rate greater than 75%. Validation in other centres is required to ensure reproducibility.

The SUrgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System (SURPAS) offers an accurate, parsimonious risk assessment method to predict postoperative complications in a broad surgical population. SURPAS, which is integrated in the electronic health record (EHR), requires manual input of 5 predictor variables (3 variables are added automatically) to generate individualized predictions of 12 postoperative complications compared to national averages. However, SURPAS has not yet been assessed specifically in patients undergoing emergency surgery. Accuracy of SURPAS risk assessment was assessed and compared to the American College of Surgeons Surgical Risk Calculator (ACS-SRC) in a sample of emergency surgery patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
SURPAS and ACS-SRC predicted risks of 7 postoperative adverse outcomes that are common between the two risk calculators (mortality, overall morbidity, readmission, UTI, cardiac, VTE, renal) were calculated for 1010 emergency surgical patients randomly selected from the ACS-NSQIP 2013-16 database; risk estimates were compared with known patient outcomes. Analysis of the data included Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) goodness of fit graphs and p-values, C-Indexes, and Brier scores.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Results were similar between SURPAS and ACS-SRC for mortality, UTI, cardiac, VTE, and renal complications. The ACS-SRC tended to underestimate overall morbidity compared to SURPAS (H-L p-values 0.05 vs. 0.45). Both calculators tended to overestimate risk for readmission (H-L p-values 0.04 and 0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Both calculators predicted mortality, UTI, cardiac, VTE, and renal complications well, but readmissions relatively poorly. SURPAS was better than ACS-SRC for predicting overall morbidity. Furthermore, SURPAS is integrated into the EHR and requires user input of only 5 variables.

Many health care organizations, however, fail to integrate health literacy principles into its structure. This study aims to assess the organizational health literacy of an academic medical center (AMC) through the perspective of the Department of Surgery and to identify areas in need of improvement.



<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;To assess organizational health literacy, the 10-item Health Literate Health Care Organization survey (HLHO-10) was administered to all the attending staff in the Department of Surgery at a single AMC from December 2018 to May 2019. The 10 items are based on the 10 attributes of a health literate organization as defined by the NAM. These include effective leadership, integration with healthcare system, employee training, patient inclusion, patient accommodation, clear interpersonal communication, easy access/navigation, media variety, informed consent, and clearly explained benefits/coverage. &nbsp;Each item is scored on a scale from one to seven, with one being &ldquo;absolutely not&rdquo; to seven being &ldquo;to a very large extent.&rdquo; Data was analyzed to estimate the organization health literacy level of the AMC through the perspective of the Department of Surgery by each domain.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Among the 118 attending physicians of the Department of Surgery who received the survey, 65 (55%) responded. The mean health literacy level of the AMC as rated by Department members was 3.84 out of 7.00. The domains &ldquo;employee training&rdquo; and &ldquo;patient inclusion&rdquo; scored the lowest with an average of 3.08 and 3.23, respectively. &ldquo;Employee training&rdquo; evaluates employee health literacy training with an emphasis on &ldquo;expert educators&rdquo; and progress monitoring. &ldquo;Patient inclusion&rdquo; assesses the involvement of patients in the development of health information and materials. Assessment of &ldquo;easy access/navigation,&rdquo; defined as access to health information and navigation within the healthcare facility, scored the highest with an average score of 4.98. Other scores are summarized in Table 1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Opportunities for improvement exist in all domains of organizational health literacy. From the perspective of the Department of Surgery, employee training in health literacy and patient inclusion in health material development at the AMC scored the lowest. Major opportunities exist to address health literacy at an organization-level with several points of needed action.

This evolution towards health system growth and consolidation has drastically changed the environment in which surgical leaders are tasked with maintaining a high standard of care within their departments. The objective of this study was to understand the most important competencies that surgical leaders used to navigate their hospital network expansion.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;In this qualitative study, we recruited 30 surgical leaders within the United States and Canada through an email sent via the Society of Surgical chairs.

Second, surgical leaders navigated the tension and dynamics that exist between the goals of their department and the goals of the healthcare system. Third, in advancing their surgical department, surgical leaders invested into the people within their department and communicated a unifying vision and culture amongst their staff. Surgical leaders have recognized that investing in the human capital will ultimately lead to the synchrony between advancing the surgical-patient experience within an economically sound healthcare network.

Many studies have identified racial disparities in access to surgical care, but there have been few investigations of disparities in the use of different anesthesia modalities for surgery. Inguinal hernia repair is the most common general surgery operation in the US, and using local rather than general anesthesia for hernia repair may enhance postoperative recovery. Our study examined racial disparities in the use of local versus general anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair. We hypothesized that African American and Hispanic patients would be less likely than Caucasians to receive local anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We analyzed data from 78,766 patients aged &ge;18 years in the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program database who underwent elective, unilateral, open inguinal hernia repair under general or local anesthesia from 1998-2018. We used multiple logistic regression to compare risk-adjusted use of local versus general anesthesia by race/ethnicity. We also compared 30-day postoperative complications among racial groups, and used a time series analysis to track trends in use of local anesthesia over the study period.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

In total, 17,892 patients (23%) received local anesthesia. When divided into groups by race/ethnicity, Caucasian patients more frequently received local anesthesia (15,009; 24%) compared to African Americans (2353; 17%) or Hispanics (530; 19%), p &lt;0.05. After adjusting for confounding variables (age, comorbidity, functional status, and frailty), we found that both African Americans (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77-0.86) and Hispanics (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.87) were significantly less likely to have hernia surgery under local anesthesia compared to Caucasians. These differences were present in each year of the study. Additionally, local anesthesia was associated with fewer postoperative complications for African American patients (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.77), but not for Hispanic patients (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.24-1.59).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Although the use of local anesthesia was associated with enhanced postoperative recovery for African American patients, they were significantly less likely to have inguinal hernias repaired under local than Caucasians. Addressing this disparity will require better understanding of how factors, including surgeon, anesthesiologist, and patient biases or preferences, may affect the choice of anesthesia modality for hernia repair.

Acute cholecystitis is among the most common biliary pathologies, and is effectively managed with cholecystectomy. In select patients, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube (PCT) placement can provide temporary drainage of the gallbladder, allowing for stabilization and interval cholecystectomy. Prior studies have reported an association between safety-net hospital status and inferior clinical outcomes, often attributing these disparities to resource limitations. We aimed to determine the impact of hospital safety-net status on cholecystostomy utilization, mortality and readmissions following PCT placement in patients with Tokyo Grade III acute cholecystitis

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All adults hospitalized for Tokyo Grade III acute cholecystitis were identified in the 2010-2015 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Hospitals were stratified into low-(LSH), medium- (MSH), or high- (HSH) safety-net tertiles based on the proportion of uninsured or Medicaid patients, and comparisons made between LSH and HSH. Categorical and continuous variables were studied using chi-square test and adjusted Wald test, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of PCT utilization. The primary outcome of the study was PCT utilization, while secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and readmission at 30 days.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 147,413 patients included for analysis, 27.5% were treated at HSH and 29.5% at LSH.

Patients treated at HSH more frequently received PCT than LSH (16.4% vs 14.7%, P=0.007), and less frequently underwent inpatient cholecystectomy (83.6% vs 85.3%, P=0.006). Mortality rates were similar at HSH and LSH (4.6% vs 4.7%, P=0.39) while 30-day readmissions were greater at HSH (25.2% vs 21.4%, P=0.009). After adjustment for patient and hospital factors, predictors of PCT use included HSH (adjusted odds ratio, AOR, 1.27, P&lt;0.001), metropolitan teaching hospitals (AOR 2.23, P&lt;0.001) and a history of chronic kidney disease (AOR 1.09, P=0.02, Figure). Among those receiving PCT, HSH was associated with increased odds of 30-day readmission (AOR 1.23, p=0.007).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Safety-net status is associated with greater use of PCT in patients admitted for Tokyo Grade III acute cholecystitis. Although there were no differences in mortality, patients receiving PCT at safety-net hospitals experienced greater readmissions. Efforts to address underlying disparities, such as access to care and resource availability, may improve care for those treated at safety-net hospitals.

Benign gallbladder disease (BGD) is one of the most common reasons for emergency general surgery admission. There are over 700,000 reported cholecystectomies performed annually in the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel SARS-COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The purpose of this study was to compare the number of cases presenting to our urban safety-net hospital and the severity of BGD admissions before and after the declaration of the pandemic and to compare trends to historic controls. We hypothesized that as a result of the pandemic declaration we would experience a decrease in the number of patients admitted but an increase in the severity of disease managed.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We performed a retrospective review of BGD admissions from January 1st - May 31st in 2018, 2019, and 2020 at our institution. The rates of BGD admissions in two-week intervals before and after the pandemic declaration were compared against an average rate from historic controls. Difference-in-differences analysis was used to determine change in trends of BGD admissions post-pandemic. Additionally, the cohort was stratified by severity of disease based on Tokyo Guidelines. Finally, the odds of presenting with greater severity of disease after the pandemic was estimated using multivariate logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There was a significant difference in differences of BGD admission rates between 2020 and previous years (DID: -1.00, 95% CI: -1.82, -0.18, p=0.0168). The mean rate of BGD in 2-week intervals decreased from 5.2 to 2.67 cases after the pandemic declaration compared to previous years, where it increased from 4.3 to 6.0. After stratifying by severity, Tokyo I admissions decreased significantly after the pandemic declaration whereas severe cases (Tokyo II and III) did not. There was no significant difference in the odds of presenting with severe disease after the pandemic was declared (aOR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.30, 3.38, p=0.9982).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

From the time the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 to May 31, 2020 there was a significant decrease in BGD admissions at our urban safety-net hospital. However, among those cases presenting to the hospital, there was no increase in the severity of disease based on the Tokyo classification. This data highlights that the pandemic impacted health care seeking behaviors for patients with milder disease while patients with severe disease continued to present to the hospital. Furthermore, this change in health seeking behavior did not lead to significantly worse disease among those admitted.

Surgeon perceptions of palliative care may drive lack of use of specialty palliative care even though data show that patients and families in the SICU could have decreased length of stay, improved communication, and improved physical and emotional well-being with earlier integration of palliative care. This study evaluated family perceptions and experiences around palliative care in a Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Semi-structured interviews were conducted from February 1, 2020 to March 5, 2020 with five families of patients in the SICU at a single institution. Given COVID restrictions, the number of interviews was limited to a pilot study. The purpose was to understand experiences of palliative care conversations with the SICU team and determine preferences for educational materials on palliative and ICU care.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The three main themes deduced from the interviews included communication, team performance, and family awareness. All&nbsp;interviewees spoke about the importance of learning style with regards to their preference of modalities for learning about palliative care and their family members&rsquo; illnesses, citing written materials, speaking with a doctor or nurse, and speaking with a social worker as&nbsp;the top three preferred modes of information delivery. Eighty percent of interviewees also emphasized the importance of clear, honest communication with the families, as well as the care team&rsquo;s inclusiveness of patients and families in decision making. Families want a general idea of the patient&rsquo;s status or condition relayed early in the conversation to set expectations, followed by the details. While 80% of interviewees had participated in goals of care (GOC) meetings based on Advanced Care Planning notes, only 40% of the interviewees correctly understood that they had been part of a GOC conversation; Forty percent reported not having had a GOC discussion when they actually had participated in one, and 20% reported having a GOC discussion when they had not. Eighty percent of&nbsp;family members&nbsp;lacked understanding of the patients&rsquo; illnesses.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This study highlights the significance of frequent communication and goals of care discussions in the SICU, as well as the importance of incorporating a variety of educational material formats.&nbsp;Further studies are needed to fill the large gap in research regarding how SICU&rsquo;s can integrate resources to help surrogates make end-of-life decisions.

During the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in New York City, we and other hospitals canceled elective surgeries to increase hospital capacity for critically ill patients. We present data from our community hospital demonstrating how such restrictions affected operative case volumes between different surgical specialties, and how we recovered from it.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Between March 17 and June 15, 2020, all elective surgeries were canceled. Operations were restricted to urgent and emergency surgeries during this time. All procedures performed during this shutdown (ORS) were recorded, as well as those 4 weeks before (PRE) and 4 weeks after (POST) for comparison. Volumes by specialty and level of surgical urgency were analyzed and compared between the three cohorts. Data is presented as mean &plusmn; SD (ANOVA) or percentages (&chi; <sup>2</sup> test).

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 2,475 cases were included in our analysis, of which 754 (30.5%) occurred during the 13-week shutdown. Overall case numbers dropped significantly during ORS and increased during recovery once restrictions were lifted (mean 245.0 &plusmn; 28.4 PRE vs 58.0 &plusmn; 30.9 ORS vs 186.0 &plusmn; 19.4 POST cases/week, p &lt; 0.001). Although emergency surgeries comprised the majority of cases during ORS (26.4% PRE vs. 59.3% ORS vs. 31.5% POST, p &lt; 0.001), the overall frequency of emergency cases decreased during this time (mean 64.5 &plusmn; 7.9 PRE vs. 34.4 &plusmn; 12.1 ORS vs. 58.5 &plusmn; 4.0 POST cases/week, p &lt; 0.001). Open surgeries represented half of all surgeries throughout all three phases and remained relatively constant proportional to caseload (52.2-54.1%). By comparison, intravascular surgeries were proportionally increased during ORS, whereas minimally invasive and robotic surgeries were proportionally decreased (+7.6%, -3.4%, -3.0%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001, see Fig. 1). General surgery saw the largest proportional increase of any service during ORS, followed by urology and neurosurgery (+9.5%, +3.0%, +2.8%, respectively).&nbsp; In contrast, orthopedics, gynecology, and otolaryngology/plastics surgeries all decreased (-5.0%, -4.4%, -5.9%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001).&nbsp; Nearly all specialties recovered to pre-shutdown levels after the OR was reopened.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

Operative volume significantly decreased during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and vascular/general surgery became the most active surgical services. Most cases recorded during this time were urgent and emergency in nature, although there were fewer emergency cases overall. We further observed a shift away from minimally invasive and robotic approaches in favor of open surgeries. This reallocation of resources may be useful for future crisis planning among community hospitals.

Bernard<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Kentucky,College Of Medicine,Lexington, KY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Acute care surgery (ACS) diagnoses make up 20% of all inpatient admissions in the U.S. and 25% of hospital costs (Knowlton). In order to inform cost reduction efforts, we sought to measure variability in hospital costs for short stay emergent laparoscopic appendectomy.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We queried our consortium database for adult and pediatric patients who underwent emergent laparoscopic appendectomy for appendicitis with length of stay &le; 3 days. We extracted calendar FY 2019 direct costs (DC) by age group and diagnosis code for sites reporting at least 5 cases. Costs in the database are derived from actual charges multiplied by a site and cost center specific cost-to-charge ratio. Labor portions are scaled per site by the area wage index by VIZIENT. Sites were ranked by quintile of DC per case to provide confidentiality and blinding.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In a total of 128 hospitals, the median number of cases per site was 35.5 (IQR 20 &ndash; 65) with a total of 6,585 cases analyzed. The largest cost centers by descending order included the OR, Med/Surg. Supplies, Routine Floor Care, Pharmacy, Emergency Room, Anesthesia, Laboratory, and CT Scans, with all others each less than 2% of total costs. The relation between OR costs and total costs is strong but not complete. The mean DC per case was $4,609 (SD 1,347). DC did not correlate with age, diagnosis code, nor total volume of cases reported by site.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Wide variation in cost of laparoscopic appendectomy in academic medical centers suggests potential for significant cost reduction. Strategic opportunities in cost reduction appear to lie outside the OR.

The objective of this study was to examine the association between primary language and urgent versus elective admission type for colon resection in patients who underwent surgery for diverticulitis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients aged 18-90 years from the 2009-2014 New Jersey Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database (NJ SID) were included if they underwent a partial colon resection (with or without ostomy) for diverticulitis. NJ SID was linked with the Federal Information Processing System to include sociodemographic information. Primary language was dichotomized into NEPL versus English primary language (EPL), and further sub-categorized into Spanish NEPL versus non-Spanish NEPL. The outcome of interest was acuity of surgical admission, dichotomized into urgent/emergent versus elective. Multivariable analyses were performed, controlling for age, sex, race, year, insurance payer, income quartile, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 9,561 patients underwent surgery for diverticulitis, of which there were 594 (6.2%) with NEPL. Among NEPL patients, 301 (51%) were primary Spanish-speakers. Patients with NEPL and EPL were similar in age (median age 58 vs 59 years; p=0.51), sex (52% vs 53% female; p=0.46) and CCI (median 1 vs 1; p=0.55). Patients with NEPL were more likely to be uninsured (19% vs 5.6%; p&lt;0.001), and more likely to live in a neighborhood below the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile for median household income (31% vs 13%; p&lt;0.001). 60% of NEPL patients had surgery during an urgent/emergent admission (as opposed to during an elective admission), compared to 48% of patients with EPL (p&lt;0.001). On multivariable analysis, NEPL was associated with increased likelihood of undergoing surgery during an urgent/emergent admission for diverticulitis (OR 1.53; p&lt;0.001) compared to patients with EPL. On further analysis of NEPL subgroups, patients with non-Spanish NEPL had significantly increased odds of urgent/emergent surgical admission&nbsp;compared to patients with EPL (OR 2.36; p&lt;0.001). The relationship between Spanish NEPL and presentation acuity did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.88; p=0.384).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients with NEPL are more likely to undergo surgery during an urgent/emergent&nbsp;admission for diverticulitis compared to their EPL counterparts. Our findings suggest that language barriers may contribute to disparities in access to elective surgery. These language barriers may manifest through disparities in&nbsp;referral patterns, provider-patient communication, and/or health literacy, and merit further examination.

Benharash<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - Los Angeles,Division Of Cardiac Surgery,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;While the laparoscopic approach is widely accepted and used in elective ventral hernia repairs, open surgery remains the standard in urgent settings. This study compared the clinical and financial outcomes of non-elective open and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair using a nationally-representative cohort.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The 2010-2017 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to identify non-elective adult (&ge;18 years) hospitalizations for ventral hernia repair performed within two days of admission. International Classification of Disease 9/10th Revision codes were used to tabulate patient and operative characteristics. Trends were examined using nonparametric tests while Chi-square or adjusted Wald tests were used to compare categorical or continuous variables, respectively. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to adjust for a multitude of covariates, including operative approach, time to operation, gangrene, obstruction, and requirement of bowel resection. Outcomes of interest were mortality, rate of routine discharge, total duration of hospitalization (LOS), and adjusted costs.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of an estimated 164,780 hospitalizations for non-elective ventral hernia repair, 22.9% utilized a laparoscopic approach. The proportion of laparoscopy exhibited a steady trend (23.9 in 2010 to 23.7% in 2017) with increased costs ($13,600 in 2010 to $16,700 in 2017, NP-trend&lt;0.001) over the study period. Concomitant bowel resection was performed in 10.3% of open and 2.0% of laparoscopic cohorts (p&lt;0.001). Patients who underwent an open repair were on average older (59.6 vs 57.4 years, p&lt;0.001) and had higher rates of ischemic bowel (1.1 vs 0.2%, p&lt;0.001) or obstruction (70.8 vs 66.3%, p&lt;0.001) compared to laparoscopic. Patients undergoing open repair had increased rates of wound infection (2.3 vs 1.0%, p&lt;0.001), sepsis (3.6 vs 1.4%, p&lt;0.001) and prolonged mechanical ventilation (5.6 vs 2.3%, p&lt;0.001). The laparoscopic cohort was discharged home more frequently and had reduced mortality, costs, and LOS (Table). After adjustment, use of laparoscopy was not associated with lower odds of in-hospital mortality, but was significantly associated with increased odds of routine discharge, and reduced LOS and costs (Table).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;While patients receiving open repair appear to be more complex, their clinical outcomes remained comparable to those having a laparoscopic repair. Further study of hernia-specific factors not captured in the NIS is warranted in order to improve patient selection for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair in the non-elective setting.

Palliative care consultations are increasing for critically ill patients and have been associated with improved outcomes and decreased cost in medical and surgical patients during their hospitalization. There is a knowledge gap on the effects of palliative care consultation on readmissions in post-surgical patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV). Thus, investigation into the fiscal efficacy of palliative care utilization within this group is warranted and we hypothesize that palliative care consultation will decrease length of stay and readmission.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Readmission Database was queried for persons between the years 2010 and 2014 who underwent a major operation (HCUP data element ORPOC=1) and required MV for over 96 consecutive hours (ICD-9-CM V46.1). Univariate and bivariate statistical analyses were performed with the outcomes of interest being total cost, length of stay, and readmission rates. For bivariate analysis, those that had a palliative care consultation were compared to those who did not. Linear regression modeling was then performed. All statistical calculations were performed using STATA (STATA Corp, LLC; College Station, TX).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The palliative care group had more comorbidities (4.7 vs 4.3, p&lt;0.001), suffered from more chronic diagnoses (8.6 vs 7.8, p&lt;0.001), and were older in mean age (65 vs 59, p&lt;0.001). Patients in the palliative care group were less likely to be discharged to home and mortality was higher (11% vs 1.2%, p&lt;0.001). Palliative care was associated with decreased average cost ($94,369 versus $112,202.10, p&lt;0.001), decreased length of stay (29.6 days vs 33.1 days, p=0.0031), but no significant difference was observed in the rate of readmission (24% vs 25%, p=0.75).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Palliative care offers benefits in terms of both healthcare resource allocation and quality of life for the critically ill patient. Our results support the efficacy of palliative care use within post-surgical patients requiring prolonged MV for inpatient outcomes.&nbsp; Further work needs to be done to understand the finding that initiating a palliative care plan did not decrease the rate of readmission.&nbsp;

Cholecystectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with over 90% of these procedures performed laparoscopically. A major cholecystectomy complication is an injury to the common bile duct (CBD). Bile duct injury incidence has been reported to be 0.3%-0.6%, with increased risk in laparoscopic procedures.&nbsp;Bile duct repair (BDR)&nbsp;following cholecystectomy is an expensive procedure, associated with higher healthcare utilization rates, cumulative cost, hospital stay, and occasional litigation.&nbsp;The true incidence, cost, and readmission rates of bile duct repair&nbsp;following cholecystectomy in the U.S. have been difficult to assess at a national level.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Readmissions Database (NRD) was used to define the incidence, cost, and readmission prevalence of post-cholecystectomy biliary repair. In this retrospective cohort study, analysis of cholecystectomy patients (N= 1,768,725) was performed using STATA software, version 14.0 (College Station, TX). Patients were included based on a series of ICD-9 codes associated with bile duct repair. Individuals were organized into cohorts based on if they were readmitted following cholecystectomy or not. Patients were stratified based on if and when they required bile duct repair following cholecystectomy.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Incidence of necessitated bile duct repair was 1.67%. Repair surgery doubled the length of stay and cost of the cholecystectomy. 2.27% of bile duct repair patients (N=671) were readmitted to the hospital. Double the proportion of patients in the lowest socioeconomic quartile were readmitted when compared with those in the highest socioeconomic quartile.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The National Readmission Database indicates the incidence of the bile duct repair following cholecystectomy is 1.67% with an average hospital stay of 10 days at a cost of approximately $33,390.48. The hospital ownership, or location did not impact the rate of BDR or readmission. Teaching hospitals had the highest rate of BDR. The socioeconomic status of patients, likewise, did not impact the rate of BDR. Patients in the lowest income quartile were twice as likely to be readmitted following BDR when compared with patients in the highest socioeconomic quartile.&nbsp;BDR is a rare but potentially impactful complication after cholecystectomy. Often iatrogenic in nature, various practices exist in documenting and billing for this procedure. To our knowledge, this is one of the few publications exploring the incidence and impact of BDR on a national level.

Lebares<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Francisco,Department Of Surgery,San Francisco, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Surgery interns are at highest risk for attrition early in training, with significantly increased risk of developing depression during the first few months and high burnout, thereafter.Many efforts to address these issues have had limited success; in part due to our incomplete understanding of causation.Maslach frames burnout as the product of a mismatch between the expectation and reality of one&#39;s work. In occupational science, demand, control and support(or resources) are recognized as critical factors influencing worker satisfaction versus strain. In General Surgery residents realistic expectations of residency demands in regard to work hours and stress levels have been associated with increased likelihood of completing training. Nevertheless, little else in known about the expectations of in-coming general surgery residents, nor how expectations might vary by gender-identity or race.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we interviewed 14 incoming interns at our institution, 57% women,exploring expectations regarding work demands and control, personal and professional support, race/gender relations, and means of experience management. An interview script was developed guided by the Job Demand Resources model.Transcripts were manually coded through an iterative process involving discussion between researchers, comparing codes between participants and noting emergent codes; later analyzed using the software Dedoose.Thematic analysis was used to develop themes, framing our understanding of intern&rsquo;s expectations.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Four main themes emerged: past experience, rewards, challenges, and the desire to belong. Key Related sub-themes were&nbsp;uncertainty, stereotypes, and lack of preparation. For example: all PGY-1s expected to encounter sexism and racism based on past experience, but had little idea of how to defend themselves or be an ally within the bounds of &nbsp;cultural stoicism; most expressed belief that previously effective methods of social support and self care wouldn&#39;t be possible during residency; a common challenge expressed involved &ldquo;hidden curriculums&rdquo; and &ldquo;backroom judgements&ldquo;. Feeling expressed&nbsp;varied from resigned and matter-of-fact, to fearful, and resentful. &nbsp;Despite this, all interns expressed excitement at starting residency.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our results suggest that expectations are influenced by&nbsp;past experience, resident shared mythology/stereotypes, level of program diversity, creating unprepared interns, and surgical culture. It is unclear exactly why interns express excitement about surgical residency after professing the culture as toxic and unreasonable, and this warrants further investigation into the surgical personality, surgical culture, and their intersection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Despite this variation, outcomes are assessed as if each procedure was equivalent. Efforts to address this disparity include scores measuring gallbladder inflammation, such as the Parkland Grading Scale (PGS), which scores inflammation on a scale from 1 to 5 based on the initial view of the gallbladder. The PGS has been prospectively validated to correlate to post-operative outcomes. We investigated if PGS led to variation of intra-operative outcomes, including operative duration (overall and per surgical phase), attainment of the Critical View of Safety (CVS), and inadvertent gallbladder injury during removal from the liver bed.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Laparoscopic&nbsp;cholecystectomy videos were&nbsp;annotated&nbsp;by one surgeon&nbsp;who&nbsp;labelled&nbsp;the timestamps for start and end of surgical phases, total laparoscopic duration (with intra-operative cholangiogram time subtracted), PGS, time the CVS was attained, and the timestamps of gallbladder injury during removal from the liver bed. Each video was also linked to the surgeon performing the case with an anonymized&nbsp;identifier. To&nbsp;analyze&nbsp;effect&nbsp;of PGS&nbsp;on overall and per-phase duration, we used a linear regression model, with the surgeon identifier as an interaction variable. We used&nbsp;this&nbsp;interaction&nbsp;variable&nbsp;because each surgeon has a different operative course due to their individual technique preferences and&nbsp;typical&nbsp;patients&rsquo;&nbsp;pathology&nbsp;(e.g.?more&nbsp;cholelithiasis&nbsp;versus&nbsp;acute cholecystitis). To analyze the PGS&rsquo;s effect on attainment of CVS and gallbladder injury, we performed&nbsp;logistic&nbsp;regression with a generalized linear model,&nbsp;using&nbsp;the surgeon as an interaction variable&nbsp;for the CVS&nbsp;to account for surgeon technique preference.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We analyzed 150&nbsp;laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos performed by 22&nbsp;surgeons.&nbsp;The videos&nbsp;had a&nbsp;median&nbsp;laparoscopic duration&nbsp;length&nbsp;of 37.2&nbsp;minutes (1<sup>st</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;quartile&nbsp;23.0-54.5&nbsp;min).&nbsp;Each point increase in the PGS led to a&nbsp;6.39&nbsp;minute&nbsp;increase in operative duration (R<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.708, 95% CI 0.330-12.5, p = 0.039),&nbsp;4.53&nbsp;minute&nbsp;increase in active dissection time (R<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.530, 95% CI 0.667-8.39, p = 0.022),&nbsp;4.96&nbsp;minute&nbsp;increase in time to first clip application (R<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.600, 95% CI 1.34-8.58, p = 0.008), and 1.40 increased odds of creating an inadvertent hole in the gallbladder (95% CI 1.03 - 1.91, p = 0.0318).&nbsp;Increases&nbsp;in PGS&nbsp;did not result in increased&nbsp;time to remove the gallbladder from the liver bed&nbsp;(p = 0.273)&nbsp;and&nbsp;did not impact&nbsp;the&nbsp;odds&nbsp;of&nbsp;attaining&nbsp;a&nbsp;CVS (p = 0.380).&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Initial assessment of gallbladder inflammation with&nbsp;PGS is predictive of the intra-operative course.&nbsp;Initial gallbladder inflammation assessment could be applied to optimize operative workflow&nbsp;and generate per-surgeon&nbsp;and per-resident&nbsp;metrics&nbsp;for&nbsp;use&nbsp;in&nbsp;quality and safety improvements&nbsp;and education.

Kaplan<sup>1</sup>, B. Moran<sup>1</sup>, P. Leung<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Einstein Medical Center,Surgery,Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
With routine administration of Gastrografin (GG) in the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO), it is important to characterize predictors of long term outcome following its use. The purpose of this study is to identify factors predictive of 1-year mortality following GG Challenge for ASBO.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective chart review from January 2016 to January 2018 identified patients who were diagnosed with ASBO by computed tomography (CT) and underwent GG Challenge. Patients were classified by 1-year survival. Patient factors, comorbidities, surgical history, features of GG administration, complications, and operative requirement were compared using chi-square or t-test. Multivariable logistic regression analyzed variables with P &lt; 0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 134 patients identified, 123 survived at least 1 year. 11 patients were deceased within 1 year conferring a 1-year mortality rate of 8.21%. Non-survivors compared to &ge;1 year survivors had a significantly higher age (77.18 vs. 65.76), proportion with congestive heart failure (CHF) (54.55% vs. 13.83%), time from admission to GG administration (45.36 hours vs. 26.48 hours), complication rate (63.64% vs. 19.42%), and operative requirement (45.45% vs. 17.89%) (P &lt; .05). On multivariable logistic regression, CHF, any post-operative complications, and operative requirement created the best-fit model for predicting 1-year mortality (R2 = .321, P &lt; .05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Advanced age, presence of CHF, late GG administration, post-operative complications, and operative requirement correlated to higher 1-year mortality in our population of ASBO patients who received GG. In particular, CHF, having any complication, and operative requirement, considered simultaneously, were the most predictive of 1-year mortality.

However, emergency general surgery continued with no changes in operative management of surgical diseases. We examined changes in appendectomy and cholecystectomy volume during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;We hypothesized that the pandemic would not affect the volume of cholecystectomies and appendectomies performed for acute disease.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Using an administrative database, appendectomies and cholecystectomies performed by the Acute Care Surgery Service at an urban academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA between April and May of 2018-2020 were identified via CPT codes. March was excluded as a washout period. Case volume from 2018 and 2019 was averaged to establish a baseline. The baseline was then compared to its respective months during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 161 appendectomies and 187 cholecystectomies performed between April 1st and May 31<sup>st</sup> of 2018-2020. Figure 1 shows the aggregate baseline for both procedures as well as the volume during COVID-19. The non-COVID data&nbsp;represents an average of case volume between 2018 and 2019 with standard error shown. The average volume per month decreased to 13 cases from 24 (-45%) in April and 21 cases from 27 (-22%) in May 2020. In April 2020, average appendectomy case volume decreased 26% while average cholecystectomy volume decreased from 14 cases to 6 (-57%). Cholecystectomy volume dropped by 24% and appendectomy by 17% in May 2020 from their respective baselines.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We saw a decrease in volume during our COVID-19 peak; a surprise given the acute nature of these disease processes. We did not note a difference in illness severity or an increase in non-operative management. As restrictions lifted in early June, appendectomy volume increased and overall volume approached historic averages. Additional analysis is required to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 on emergency general surgery volume.

Intraoperative carcinoid crisis (CC), characterized by hemodynamic instability, is thought to be a common and potentially lethal complication, with preoperative octreotide often recommended as a prevention strategy. However, recent society guidelines raised concern regarding limited data on CC and the use of prophylactic octreotide. Our goal was to systematically evaluate existing evidence characterizing CC, and to examine the efficacy of prophylactic octreotide from published reports. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. A systematic search was done using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library to identify published studies relevant to CC occurring during surgery for NET (2000-2020). Records were independently reviewed by two authors for study relevance and discrepancies resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. Eligibility criteria included studies of patients having surgery for well-differentiated midgut NET and/or NET liver metastasis, and reporting data on any of the following CC endpoints: incidence, risk factors, and prognosis, and on the efficacy of prophylactic octreotide. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects restricted maximal likelihood models.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The initial search produced 345 unique records. After screening and full-text review, 8 studies met inclusion criteria (n=943 operations). Hemodynamic instability was the primary feature used to define CC, with some variation and no standard definition across the studies. Similarly, for studies comparing use of prophylactic octreotide, regimens varied by dose and timing of octreotide administration. After meta-analysis evaluation, the pooled incidence of CC was 19% (95% CI [0.06-0.36]), with presence of liver metastasis (odds ratio 2.85 [1.49-5.47]) and male gender (0.58 [0.34-0.99]) found to be the only significant risk factors. The occurrence of CC was not associated with increased risk of postoperative mortality (1.19[0.13-11.02]), however it was associated with increased risk of major postoperative complications (2.12[1.03-4.35]). The use of prophylactic octreotide was not associated with decreased risk of CC on the pooled data (0.73[0.32-1.66]) or sensitivity analysis for studies that tested multiple regimens&nbsp;(preoperative octreotide: 0.70[0.30-1.59] and intraoperative octreotide: 0.82[0.36-1.85]).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We found that CC occurs frequently in patients having surgery for midgut NETs, specifically those with NET liver metastasis, and is associated with worse postoperative outcomes. Current data does not support the use of routine prophylactic octreotide. Future studies should focus on prospective evaluation of well-defined prophylactic protocols using a standardized definition for CC.

The expansion of robotic-assisted surgery is occurring quickly, particularly with resections of the pancreas. While many surgeons are proficient in open pancreatic surgery, few have been trained to perform pancreatic resections utilizing the robot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many high volume robotic pancreatic surgeons advocate starting a robotic pancreatic practice utilize a 2-surgeon (2S) approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, little is known regarding the outcomes of the 2-surgeon approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this study is to evaluate a 2-surgeon approach in application for robotic pancreatic resections.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We queried a prospectively maintained pancreatic database to identify all patients undergoing pancreatic resection utilizing the robot from 2012-2019. The surgeon who instituted the database was involved in all the surgical procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional surgeon was hired in 2017 and a 2-surgeon technique was adopted for all pancreatic resections. We then compared a single surgeon&rsquo;s experience to a dual surgeon approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;We compared operative times, conversion rates, morbidity, mortality, pancreatic leak and re-admissions. Statistical analyses were undertaken utilizing Chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U-test where appropriate. Significance was accepted with p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified 160 patients with a median age of 71 (24-91).&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 91 males and 69 females.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mean BMI and ASA was 27.4&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;4.7 and 2.8&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.6. There were 61 (38.1) adenocarcinomas, 44 (27.5) IPMN, 29 (18.1) neuroendocrine, and 26 (16.3) other.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 83 patients who underwent surgery by a single surgeon and 77 by a 2-surgeon technique.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mean operative time was lower in the 2S approach 401 vs 194, p&lt;0.001. Estimated blood loss was also slightly lower in the 2S cohort 125 vs 50, p=0.02.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversion to open was 4.8% in the 1S vs 1.3% in the 2S group, p=0.37. There were no differences in R0 resections p=0.5, re-operations p=0.11, or length of stay p=0.15.&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-admission rates were lower in the 1S group 12% vs 24.7%, p=0.04.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no differences in overall or grade III-V morbidity between groups, p=0.07. The pancreatic leak rate was higher in the 2S group compared to 1S: 27.3% vs 10.8%, p=0.01.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no differences in mortality between groups, p=0.28.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
A 2-surgeon approach to robotic pancreatic resection does improve operative time, estimated blood loss with&nbsp;slight improvements in conversion to open procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the morbidity, and oncologic parameters were not significantly different amongst the 2 groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pancreatic leak rates however were higher in the 2- surgeon approach, but this may be related to differences in experience between the co-surgeons.&nbsp;

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma commonly metastasizes to lymph nodes (LN) and adequate lymphadenectomy is a key component of pancreatic oncological resections. Minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (MIP) is increasingly being performed in the United States. This study aimed to compare the lymph node yield between MIP and open approaches.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The 2010-2016 National Cancer Database was utilized to identify patients who underwent laparoscopic, robotic or open pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Primary outcome was adequate lymphadenectomy, defined as retrieval of &ge; 15 LNs. LN yield was examined for MIP (laparoscopic and robotic) and open approaches.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 11888 patients were identified, of those 2172 (18.2%) underwent MIP. The conversion rate was 24.4% (n=531). The majority of the MIP cases were performed at Academic Cancer Programs (64.3%). Interestingly, 66.2% of the MIP cases were performed at facilities with less than 15 cases/year. Compared to open pancreatoduodenectomy, MIP was associated with higher odds of LN yield &ge;15, with an adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 1.24, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.06-1.39. There was no significant difference in the odds of positive margins (aOR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.82-1.06) and 90-day mortality (aOR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.67-1.06) between MIP and open approaches.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this large population-based database analysis, MIP was independently associated with a higher LN yield than open pancreatoduodenectomy. No difference in rate of positive margins or 90-day mortality. These findings suggest MIP can be performed safely, while maintaining oncological standards. Further prospective data is needed to confirm these findings.

We aim to evaluate our initial outcomes with robotic Klatskin tumor resection as a potential alternative to the &lsquo;open&rsquo; approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: With IRB approval, all patients who underwent robotic resection of a Klatskin tumor were prospectively studied. Demographics, jaundice, ASA class, and perioperative outcomes were collected. Postoperative complications were defined according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, data are presented as median (mean &plusmn; SD).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Eight patients who underwent robotic Klatskin tumor resection were included. Their median age was 75 (72 &plusmn; 8.2) years, BMI of 23 (25 &plusmn; 6.1) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, ASA Class of 3 (2.8 &plusmn; 0.5), and MELD score of 9 (11 &plusmn; 6.8). By the Bismuth-Corlette classification 3 patients had type 2 lesion, one type 3A and four type 3B. Median tumor size was 2 (3 &plusmn; 1.8) cm. Two patients (25%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical resection. All eight patients had preoperative stent placement. Estimated blood loss was 150 (175 &plusmn; 130.9) mL and operative time of 492 (466 &plusmn; 96.2) minutes.&nbsp; There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to &lsquo;open&rsquo;. 6 patients had concomitant major hepatectomy (Table). Three patients developed postoperative complications (two bile leak, one perihepatic collection).&nbsp; No patients required ICU admission, blood transfusion, or reoperation. On final pathology, seven patients had cholangiocarcinoma; one demonstrated a complete pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy. Negative margins were achieved in all patients. 7 patients received adjuvant therapy. No 90-day mortality occurred.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: To our knowledge, this is the first U.S study evaluating this technique. Robotic resection for Klatskin Tumor is safe and feasible with favorable short-term outcomes. Robotic approach serves as a potential alternative to the conventional &lsquo;open&rsquo; method.&nbsp;

Bile duct obstruction (BDO) due to choledocholithiasis can be treated using different procedural modalities, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), common bile duct exploration (CBDE), and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC).&nbsp;ERCP is generally seen as the standard of care for BDO, with CBDE and PTC serving as viable alternatives when ERCP is unavailable. We used a retrospective cohort analysis to compare the outcomes of these three techniques in the clearance of biliary obstruction.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using data from the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) from 2010 to 2014, we identified 25,985 patients with a non-malignant etiology of biliary obstruction who received ERCP, PTC or CBDE. The NRD utilizes Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project&rsquo;s (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID) discharge data from 28 states, which accounts for 60% of the U.S. resident population and can be used to produce estimates on approximately 36 million discharges. Patient demographics, treating hospital characteristics, and patient outcomes were explored using this data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
ERCP was&nbsp;the most common procedure for BDO (22518 patients vs. 1316 for CBDE, 964 for PTC). Patients treated by PTC had the most readmissions (8.9% vs. 5.4% for ERCP, 0.6% for CBDE, p&lt;0.0001), longer LOS (9.325 vs. 6.400 and 7.729, p&lt;0.0001), and higher total cost ($27,787 vs. $17,371 and $23,492, p&lt;0.0001). Compared to CBDE, PTC was associated with significantly longer LOS (IRR=1.14, p=0.001) and a higher rate of readmission (OR=16.03, p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our results demonstrate that PTC is performed on patients with overall increased morbidity and is associated with worse outcomes when compared to ERCP and CBDE. In patients with BDO who cannot undergo ERCP, our data suggests that surgical exploration is preferential to percutaneous biliary drainage.

Therefore, we sought to provide a descriptive analysis of prisoners involved in trauma and evaluate whether any healthcare disparities exist for this vulnerable population. We hypothesized that prisoner trauma patients have a similar risk of mortality and in-hospital complications compared to non-prisoner trauma patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2015-2016) was queried for trauma patients based upon location inside or outside of prison at the time of injury.&nbsp;A multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for age, injury severity score, comorbidities and initial vital signs amongst other known predictors of mortality, was performed to compare these groups for risk of mortality&mdash;the primary outcome.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;From 593,818 trauma patients, 1115 were located in prison.&nbsp;Compared to non-prisoners, prisoner trauma patients had no significant difference in mortality (5.1% vs. 6.0%, p=0.204). However, prisoners had a shorter length of stay (LOS) (mean days, 6.3 vs 7.8, p&lt;0.001), shorter intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (mean days, 5.44 vs 5.89, p=0.004), and fewer complications, including lower rates of drug/alcohol withdrawal (0.4% vs 1.1%, p=0.030), pneumonia (0.5% vs 1.6%, p=0.004), and urinary tract infections (0.0% vs 1.1%, p&lt;0.001).

Trauma or other unintentional injury is one of the most common causes of death in the United States. With the high prevalence of trauma cases nationwide it is important to improve both the efficiency and outcomes of trauma services. Although trauma readmission rates are generally low, trauma readmission is indicative of both quality of care and level of acuity. Understanding predictors for unplanned readmissions could help prevent and mitigate their impact. We aim to identify factors that predict readmission among trauma patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We performed an IRB approved retrospective chart review of all patients over 18 admitted to our trauma service between 2016 &amp; 2018. Patients who expired during the initial admission were excluded from analysis. From hospital records we were able to isolate all readmissions for included patients within 30 days of initial discharge. Each readmission was validated to ensure that it was related to the initial admission and classified based on reason for readmission. Univariate/multivariate analyses were performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

9,081 patients were included with 906 readmitted within 30 days (9.98%). There were 1,050 total readmissions within this time period.

Patients in the readmitted group presented at a significantly younger age (51.43 vs 56.09, p&lt;0.001) with significantly higher BMIs (32.18 vs 27.57, p=0.002). Patients in the readmitted group were significantly more likely to be male (68.32% vs 60.81%, p&lt;0.001).

The most common reasons for readmission were fracture complications (25.5%), pain control (16.4%), sepsis or other infection (13.6%), and disease/symptom progression (11.9%). Initial injury type was significantly different between the groups with more readmitted patients presenting with penetrating injuries (p=0.035). Initial discharge disposition was also significantly different between the groups (p&lt;0.001). There were no differences in ISS, GCS, or length of initial admission between the groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our results suggest that age, BMI, gender, injury type, and discharge disposition are associated with unplanned trauma readmissions. These factors should be addressed when counselling and planning discharge.

Compared to the PRE cohort there were less patients in the POST cohort (277 vs. 373). Patients in the POST group had higher rates of insurance coverage (91.3% vs. 78.8%, p&lt;0.001), self-transportation (7.2% vs. 2.7%, p&lt;0.01) to the hospital, and hospital admission (72.6% and 46.1%, p&lt;0.001). There was no difference in patient demographics including age, sex, field and emergency department vitals, and presentations of penetrating trauma (all p &gt;0.05). Patients in the POST cohort had higher rates of motor vehicle accidents (56.7% vs. 46.5%, p&lt;0.01) and crush injuries (1.1% vs. 0%, p= 0.044). There was no difference in mortality (1.6% vs. 1.4%, p=0.866) trauma bay procedures (18.1% vs. 12.6%, p = 0.056), operations (12.6% vs. 8.6%, p=0.093), total ( 2 vs. 2, p = 0.719) and intensive care unit length of stay (LOS) (0 vs. 0, p = 0.871), ventilator days (0 vs. 0, p = 0.840), and transfusion of all blood products at 4 and 24 hours. All complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia/ventilator associated pneumonia, urinary tract infection, stroke, and bacteremia were also similar between the two cohorts (all p&gt;0.05).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
After opening a second L-II PTC within a two-mile radius, there was an increase in patient admissions and self-transportation at the pre-existing L-II PTC. Despite a nearly 26% decrease in trauma volume, there was no difference in LOS, hospital complications, or mortality. Further studies are warranted to assess long-term outcomes at existing PTCs with decreasing volume due to new trauma centers&nbsp;to understand any long-term ramifications of opening new PTCs.&nbsp;

Doing so may highlight healthcare disparities that could benefit from public health education and advocacy. We sought to investigate whether the ethnicity of farmers in the United States (U.S.) predicts for disparities in injury severity, initial presentation, management, and outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective cohort study of the NTDB was performed including adult farmers in the U.S. who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) after experiencing traumatic injury during 2012-2016. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the differences in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) response and transport time, transfer rates, presentation to University or Level I trauma hospitals, Injury Severity Scores (ISS), length of stay (LOS) in the ED or hospital, being taken to the OR, mechanical ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU),&nbsp;and mortality based on ethnicity.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 6,161 farm-related injury incidences included in this study, 23% were amongst Hispanics, and 77% were amongst Non-Hispanics. The distribution of sex was identical: 93% male and 7% female in each group. The majority of Hispanic patients were located in the West (51%), while the majority of Non-Hispanic patients were located in the Midwest (40%). Hispanic patients were more likely to present to a University or Level I trauma hospital (45% &amp; 46%, respectively vs. 38% &amp; 37% of Non-Hispanics). Both groups relied primarily on private insurance for payment (75% of Hispanics and 64% of Non-Hispanics). However, a greater proportion of Non-Hispanic patients had Medicare coverage (14% vs. 1% of Hispanics), while more Hispanic patients paid out-of-pocket (15% vs. 11% of Non-Hispanics). Non-Hispanic patients had longer EMS response times (21 minutes vs. 17 minutes for Hispanics) and total EMS transport times (88 minutes vs. 72 minutes for Hispanics). Non-Hispanic patients had a shorter length of stay in the ED (167 minutes vs. 184 minutes for Hispanics) and in the hospital (3 days (IQR=4) vs. 3 days (IQR=5) for Hispanics). Non-Hispanic patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (17% vs. 15% of Hispanics). ISS was higher in Non-Hispanics (9) than Hispanics (5).&nbsp;Transfer rates, being taken to the OR, mechanical ventilation, and mortality were similar in both groups. Multivariable analyses indicated small statistically significant differences between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic farmers with respect to EMS response, EMS transport times, and length of stay in the ED or hospital.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Fortunately, there exist marginal but clinically insignificant differences in the EMS response time, EMS transport time, ED LOS and hospital LOS among farm-related injuries, indicating a clinically equivalent level of care between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic farmers.

We sought to prospectively evaluate the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA-PS) classification and the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) surgical risk-calculator (SRC), hypothesizing that they will improve the predictions for risk of mortality and LOS compared to TRISS alone.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A prospective, observational multicenter study (9/2018-2/2020) of trauma patients &ge;18 years-old undergoing an operation within 24 hours of admission was performed.&nbsp; Logistic regression models were performed with Brier scores and ROC area calculations and R<sup>2</sup> and root mean squared error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the ability to predict mortality and LOS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 4 Level I trauma centers, 1231 patients had a mean ISS of 13 and the most common ASA-PS was ASA II (36.1%). Blunt trauma accounted for 75.5% of traumas. &nbsp;The overall mortality rate was 4.6%. The Brier Score and ROC for mortality were found with improving accuracy in the following order: ASA-PS (0.037, 0.885), NSQIP (0.035, 0.909), TRISS (0.030, 0.915), TRISS+NSQIP (0.023, 0.935) and TRISS+ASA-PS (0.029, 0.937). However, when comparing TRISS alone to TRISS+ASA-PS (p=0.07) and TRISS+NSQIP (p=0.38) there was no improvement in prediction of mortality. NSQIP performed best for LOS (R<sup>2</sup>: NSQIP 24.9%, ASA-PS 18.3%, TRISS 8.6%) (RMSE: NSQIP 14.65, ASA 15.27, TRISS 16.17). The addition of TRISS to NSQIP performed minimally better (25.2%, 4.651).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite lacking comorbidities, TRISS predicts mortality better than ASA-PS and NSQIP-SRC. TRISS mortality prediction is not improved by adding ASA-PS or NSQIP-SRC. However, NSQIP-SRC was the most accurate predictor of LOS.

Taking methamphetamines (meth) causes significant vasoconstriction, which can be severe enough to cause bowel ischemia. Methamphetamines have also been shown to alter the immune response through changes in cytokine signaling, as well as macrophage and T-cell activation. These effects could predispose meth users to poor wound healing, increased infections, and other post-operative complications. The effect of meth use on surgical outcomes in trauma patients is not known. We hypothesized that methamphetamine users would have longer length of stay and higher rates of complications compared to non-meth users.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The trauma registry for our urban Level 1 trauma center was searched for patients that received an exploratory laparotomy for traumatic injury from 2016 to 2019. Length of stay (LOS) and ventilator days were compared using nonparametric statistics and reported as median and interquartile range. Age, injury severity score (ISS), and abbreviated injury scale (AIS) were compared using a Student&rsquo;s T-test. A Chi Square test was used to compare gender, mechanism of injury, and rates of infectious complications. Significance was set at &lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Hospital LOS [8.0 (5-18) v 7.5 (4-15) days, p=0.73], ICU LOS [2.0 (0-5.0) v 2.0 (0-6.0) days, p=0.98], and ventilator days [0.0 (0-4.0) v 0.0 (0-3.0) days, p=0.95] were equivalent between meth positive and negative patients. Age (37.3&plusmn;12.0 v 38.1&plusmn;17.3 years, p=0.74), percent male (94.4% v 86.4%, p=0.11), percent penetrating injury (66.7% v 52.6%, p=0.18), and abdominal AIS (2.9&plusmn;0.9 v 3.0&plusmn;1.0, p=0.62) were equivalent between groups. There were no central line-associated infections in either group. Rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia, intraabdominal abscess requiring percutaneous drain placement, and unplanned returns to the operating room were the same between groups (see table 1), as were ISS and mortality. Methamphetamine positive patients had a significantly higher rate of surgical site infections (SSI).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Methamphetamine use is associated with an increased rate of SSI after trauma laparotomy. This could be related to microvascular disease and immunomodulation caused by meth use, though the mechanism is not known. However, other serious complications and mortality were not affected by methamphetamine use.

Despite evidence showing a low incidence of cervical spine injuries on CSCT in pediatric, including adolescent, trauma patients, recent evidence demonstrates that adult trauma centers over utilize this imaging modality during the trauma evaluation of adolescent patients. The aim of this study is to review our trauma center&rsquo;s use of CSCT in the adolescent blunt trauma population. We hypothesized that our level one trauma center will overuse CT scans.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a retrospective review of adolescent (13-18 year old) blunt trauma patients at our urban adult level 1 trauma center from January 2016 to December 2019. We accessed our trauma database to identify patients &lt; 18 years old that underwent a CSCT scan following blunt trauma. The primary outcome was the prevalence of positive findings on CSCT scan. Univariate Fischer-Exact analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between the national emergency x-ray utilization study (NEXUS) criteria and CSCT result. Individual components of the NEXUS criteria were assessed using multivariate regression.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Two hundred seventy-seven adolescent patients underwent a CSCT. Of those, 68% (189) were male, the mean age was 16.5&plusmn;1.6 years old, and 56% (156) were African American. The most common mechanism of injury was motor vehicle collision (58%) and the mean injury severity score (ISS) was 16.6&plusmn;11.6. Thirty-five patients (13%) had a positive finding on CSCT. Of those, only 3 (1%) required surgical intervention. Thirty-four (97%) patients with a positive CSCT also failed NEXUS criteria. Ninety-three (38%) patients with a negative CSCT met NEXUS criteria indicating a low suspicion for cervical spine injury. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, midline cervical spine tenderness (OR = 4.7; 95% CI: 1.9-11.9; p &lt; 0.01), focal neurological deficit (OR = 5.5; 95% CI: 1.9-16.2; p &lt; 0.01), and presence of a distracting injury (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.0-5.0; p = 0.04) were independently associated with a positive CSCT. NEXUS criteria based on our data has a sensitivity of 97.1% and a specificity of 38.4%, which is comparable to the current literature.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: CSCT scans in adolescent blunt trauma patients are overutilized. There is a low positive CSCT scan rate among this population.&nbsp; A quality improvement project focusing on the use of the NEXUS criteria to assess risk of cervical spine injury could potentially reduce the use of CSCT scans by nearly 40%.

The benefit of whole blood transfusion in pre-hospital cardiac arrest has not been previously reported. The objective of this study was to determine if patients in cardiac arrest who received pre-hospital low titer O+ whole blood (PH-LTOWB) had improved survival in the trauma bay and also improved overall survival to discharge.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of 546 trauma patients receiving blood transfusions was performed from 2015-2019. Inclusion criteria included patients with documented prehospital cardiac arrest and patients were excluded if the full prehospital record was not available. Univariate analysis was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 40 (7.3%) patients had on-scene CPR with 11 patients receiving PH-LTOWB. Baseline demographics, ISS, AIS chest and AIS abdomen, and arrival pH were similar between groups (p&gt;0.05). Higher AIS head was found in the non-transfused cohort (2.7+/- 0.3 vs. 3.9+/- 0.2, p=0.003).&nbsp; EMS on scene time was significantly longer in the patients receiving PH-LTOWB (18.4+/- 1.6 vs 11.1+/- 1.4 min, p=0.006). Trauma bay mortality was similar with 63.6% (n=7) in the transfused group and 55.0% in the non-transfused group (n=22) (p=0.46). In-hospital mortality for the PH-LTOWB group was 81.8% and 100% for the non-transfused group (p=0.07).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Pre-hospital blood is an important adjunct in the surgeon&#39;s armamentarium for the management of patients with hemorrhagic shock. In our study, we found no survival benefit in transfusing PH-LTOWB for trauma patients in cardiac arrest on the scene and with likely unsurvivable injuries. We also found a longer on-scene time for patients receiving blood transfusions. Blood should be reserved for patients with a survival benefit.

Use of machine learning (ML) based prediction models may identify previously unconsidered factors predictive of transfusion need. Our goal was to use ML novel approach to identify parameters most predictive of blood transfusion need following MT activation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Trauma patients who received MT activation upon presentation were reviewed from March 2015 to September 2019 and grouped by those who received blood (+) and those who did not (-). Parameters reviewed included demographics, injury characteristics, interventions (embolization or operative), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), and blood product utilization. The automated ML platform MILO (Machine Intelligence Learning Optimizer) generated models using different parameter combinations and compared each model&rsquo;s performance against the target&rsquo;s (blood given or not) true prevalence through seven supervised statistical algorithms (Gradient Boosting Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, na&iuml;ve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1,302 patients were included; 797 received blood products. The training data set [443 patients; 212 (+), 231 (-)] and generalization set [593 patients; 352 (+), 241 (-)] created a total of 350,811 models for analysis. The model with the highest F1 (0.802) included age, sex, cause and grade of injury, initial imaging, vital signs (SBP, RR, O2 Sat, HR), GCS, hematocrit (HCT), TXA administration, (+) FAST exam, intervention performed, ISS, and RTS. This model had a sensitivity of 71.9% [66.9%-76.5%], specificity of 92.5% [88.5%-95.5%], and positive predictive value (PPV) of 93.4% [90.0-95.7%]. A second model with a similar F1 (0.802) considered 75% of parameters after excluding sex, penetrating injury, FAST, and embolization location. This model had a sensitivity of 72.2% [67.2%-76.8%], specificity of 92.1% [88.0%-95.2%], and PPV of 93.0% [89.6%-95.4%].

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: ML analysis revealed several models with high accuracy for predicting blood transfusions by F1 score, high specificity, and positive predictive value. This was also maintained in models using a reduced number of parameters. Parameters most predictive of blood transfusion included age, cause and grade of injury, initial imaging, presenting vital signs and HCT, TXA administration, operative need, and both ISS and RTS. ML remains novel in the trauma setting and will require further optimization to best predict blood product utilization.

Large-scale disasters are hazardous events that overwhelm a community&rsquo;s capacity and typically require external assistance. With increasing threats from climate change, rapid population growth, suboptimal urbanization, and poverty, the human impact of large-scale disasters is likely to grow. &ldquo;Resilient hospitals&rdquo; have been increasingly recognized as a critical element of disaster reduction. While various frameworks of hospital resilience have been proposed, they mostly emerged from pre-disaster considerations, and have not incorporated evidence from post-disaster impact on hospitals and post-disaster resilience mechanisms. We aimed to&nbsp;investigate&nbsp;the impact of a high-magnitude earthquake in a tertiary hospital in Nepal, and its&nbsp;resilience mechanisms. Specifically, we studied&nbsp;the profile of admitted earthquake victims, analyzed differences in total&nbsp;hospital admissions, and examined staff experiences of hospital resilience.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We used a combination of quantitative data from routinely generated hospital records and qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with hospital staff. We described the profile of admitted earthquake victims to understand the burden to the hospital, and compared total admissions after the earthquake with a pre-earthquake baseline in terms of number, diagnostic category, and length of hospital stay. Finally, we used mixed deductive and inductive coding for the qualitative data&nbsp;to analyze hospital resilience.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Many of the injured who made it to the study hospital required surgical interventions and long hospitalizations. Being a tertiary hospital, it also received referrals of more severe cases, which posed additional strains. For six weeks, the average number of daily admissions decreased. During this period, the share of injury-related admissions was particularly high, and such admissions were particularly long. Admissions due to other conditions relatively decreased and were shorter than usual. We found that the hospital&rsquo;s resilience was highly dependent on emerging adaptations in addition to pre-existing conditions. Operational aspects were the biggest influencers of hospital resilience. Since they were highly dependent on human behavior, individual resilience played a major role, and we found that hospital staff were conditioned by senses of safety, meaningfulness, and belonging.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Hospitals should prepare resources and plan for their known disaster risks, but should also allow for a certain flexibility to innovative adaptions to emerging, unforeseen challenges. In addition, challenges faced by hospital workers should not be undermined, and supporting them will increase hospital resilience.

With the growing geriatric population, there is a paralleled increase of spinal trauma in elderly patients. The aims of this study were to compare injury characteristics and outcomes between geriatric (&ge;65 years old) and non-geriatric patients who had a cervical spinal cord injury with neurological deficit (CSCIND).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This retrospective cohort study included 255 patients with CSCIND admitted to three Level 1 Trauma Centers between February 2015 and March 2020. Patients were separated and compared in two groups: 104 geriatric patients (GP) and 151 non-geriatric patients (NGP). Analyzed variables included: age, comorbidities, anticoagulation use, mechanism of injury (MOI), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment grade, Neurological Level of Injury (NLI), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) co-injury, incidence of vertebrae fractures, cervical spine procedures, hospital discharge disposition, and mortality.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The GP group was significantly older than the NGP group (77.4 vs 44.1 years), and accordingly had significantly higher rates of comorbidities (85.6% vs 53.6%), dementia (10.6% vs 0.7%), and anticoagulant use (49.0% vs 7.3%), with all p&lt;0.001 [Fig. 1]. Regarding MOI, the GP group was significantly more likely to get a CSCIND as a result of a fall (69.2% vs 25.2%, p&lt;0.001), while the NGP group as a result of a motor vehicle accident (28.9% vs 62.9%, p&lt;0.001). There was no difference in injury severity between the groups, as the ISS (20.6 vs 21.3, p=0.7), GCS (13.6 vs 13.1, p=0.3), and TBI co-injury (5.8% vs 6.6%, p=0.8) were all similar. Additionally, there was no difference in the distribution of ASIA grade (p=0.9) or NLI (p=0.3) between the groups. GP had a significantly higher incidence of vertebrae fractures (67.3% vs 50.3%, p=0.007), with cervical vertebrae fractured in 62.5% of GP versus 50.3% in NGP (p=0.06). Cervical spine procedures were performed equally often in both groups (64.0% vs 64.0%, p=1.0). Significantly more GP than NGP were discharged to hospice (16.3% vs 4.0%, p&lt;0.001), resulting in a significantly higher mortality rate among GP (19.2% vs 6.0%, p=0.001). Of the GP who expired, 25.0% (n=5) had a Do Not Resuscitate order or an Advanced Directive in place.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Despite geriatric cervical spinal cord injury resulting from a lower energy trauma, the spinal injury severity was similar to non-geriatric trauma patients, even in the presence of more vertebrae fractures. Geriatric patients had higher rates of discharge to hospice and mortality, which can be attributed to their higher rates of underlying comorbidities and presence of advanced directives, as compared to their non-geriatric counterparts.

New injury severity score (NISS) and clinical outcomes were obtained. Plasma HA levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 0, 12, 24, and 48h. HA levels were also measured in healthy controls (HC). TIC was defined as admission INR &gt; 1.2 or PTT &ge; 36.5 sec. Comparisons of HA levels were assessed at each time point, and Spearman&rsquo;s correlations were performed between 0h and 24h HA levels, coagulation measures and clinical outcomes. P-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Forty-nine trauma patients and 25 controls were enrolled for study. Sixteen (32.7%) trauma patients were coagulopathic at admission. NISS did not differ between patients with and without TIC; however, HA levels in coagulopathic trauma patients were higher than non-coagulopathic patients at all time points and elevated above HC levels at 24 and 48h (Figure 1).&nbsp;At arrival, HA levels correlated with TEG R-time (Spearman&rsquo;s rho = 0.395,&nbsp;p = 0.021), PTT (rho = 0.420,&nbsp;p = 0.003), and INR (rho = 0.405,&nbsp;p = 0.004). At 24h, HA levels correlated with total 24h blood product transfusion requirements (rho = 0.371,&nbsp;p = 0.010), intensive care unit length of stay (rho = 0.359,&nbsp;p = 0.012), and hospital length of stay (rho = 0.337, p&nbsp;= 0.019).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Shed HA is associated with coagulation abnormalities in trauma patients, which may contribute to worse outcomes. These findings highlight the need for additional studies to evaluate the mechanistic role of HA in TIC.

Benharash<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - Los Angeles,Division Of Cardiac Surgery,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

&nbsp;

Frailty has been associated with increased mortality and postoperative complications following endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR). While coding-based frailty tools may readily identify at-risk patients, their utility has not been examined in EVAR or TEVAR (thoracic aortic aneurysm repair) at the national level. We aimed to characterize the differential impact of frailty on clinical outcomes and resource use following such procedures using a nationally representative cohort.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

&nbsp;

The 2005-&lsquo;17 National Inpatient Sample was queried to identify all adults undergoing EVAR or TEVAR. Patients were considered frail&nbsp;if they suffered from any of the frailty defining diagnoses in the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups based on International Classification of Diseases Revisions 9/10. Relevant patient and hospital variables were compared across groups using the chi-square test for categorical and adjusted Wald test for continuous variables. Multivariable regression models were used to identify independent associations with outcomes of interest which included in-hospital mortality, length of stay, non-home discharge and hospitalization costs. Predicted marginal effects were used to provide risk adjusted estimates with 95% confidence intervals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

&nbsp;

Of an estimated 489,219 patients, 86.8% underwent EVAR and the remainder TEVAR. The annual incidence of EVAR (21,568 in 2005 to 43,140 cases in 2017) and TEVAR (649 in 2005 to 7,230 cases in 2017) increased significantly over the study period (all NP-trend&lt;0.001). The prevalence of frailty was lower in the cohort undergoing EVAR (4.5%) compared to TEVAR (8.9%).&nbsp;Frail&nbsp;patients were on average older (74.4 vs 72.0 years, P&lt;0.001), more commonly female (31.2% vs 22.1%, P&lt;0.001), and had a greater burden of comorbidities as measured by the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (4.3 vs 3.3, P&lt;0.001). After adjustment, frailty was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and non-home discharge rates for both EVAR and TEVAR cohorts (Figure). Frailty was also associated with higher predicted costs (EVAR: $51,300 vs $30,000, TEVAR: $100,500 vs $59,800) and longer lengths of stay (EVAR: 10.9 days vs 3.4 days, TEVAR: 20.4 days vs 9.5 days). Frailty had a greater marginal effect on mortality and non-home discharge rates in the setting of EVAR relative to TEVAR (Figure).&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

Although frailty portends inferior outcomes for both cohorts, it imparts a greater detriment to those undergoing EVAR compared to TEVAR. Given the apparent impact of coding-based frailty determination, its inclusion in existing risk models may better inform shared decision making.&nbsp;

Hospitals with a high safety-net burden have been associated with inferior clinical outcomes and increased resource use.&nbsp;However, there is a paucity of studies examining this relationship in patients undergoing carotid revascularization. We aimed to characterize the association of safety-net burden with outcomes and resource utilization in a nationally representative cohort of patients undergoing carotid interventions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The 2010-2017 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) was used to identify all adults undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS). International Classification of Diseases 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> Revision codes and the NRD data dictionary were utilized to tabulate patient and hospital characteristics. Using previously reported methodology, hospitals were classified as low- (LBH), medium-, or high- safety-net burden (HBH) based on the proportion of uninsured or Medicaid patients undergoing the above procedures. Multivariable regression models were developed to evaluate associations between safety-net burden and in-hospital mortality, postoperative stroke, length of stay, hospitalization costs, and 30-day readmissions.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of an estimated 540,558 hospitalizations for a carotid intervention, 28.5% were at HBH. Compared to LBH, a greater proportion of patients at HBH received CAS (18.7% vs 8.9%, P&lt;0.001). Patients treated at HBH were more likely to be admitted non-electively (28.7% vs. 20.2%, P&lt;0.001), have a higher burden of comorbidities (2.8 vs 2.6 as measured by Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, P&lt;0.001) and have symptomatic presentation (11.0% vs 7.7%, P&lt;0.001). HBH was associated with increased unadjusted rates of in-hospital mortality (0.8% vs 0.4%, P&lt;0.001),&nbsp;stroke (0.9% vs 0.7%, P=0.03),&nbsp;30-day readmissions (7.4% vs 6.2%, P&lt;0.001) as well as hospitalization costs ($16,537 vs $14570, P&lt;0.001) and length of stay (3.7 vs 2.9 days, P&lt;0.001). Hospitalization costs increased significantly over the study period for both HBH and LBH as shown in Figure 1 (nptrend&lt;0.001). After adjustment for patient and hospital factors, HBH remained associated with increased odds of stroke (AOR: 1.16, P=0.02, Ref=LBH) and 30-day readmissions (AOR: 1.12, P&lt;0.001).&nbsp;Although HBH was not associated with&nbsp;mortality (AOR: 1.14, P=0.10) or length of stay (&beta;: +0.02 days, P=0.76) after adjustment, it was linked to increased hospitalization costs (&beta;: +$1,964, P&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

High safety-net burden was associated with several adverse outcomes and increased hospitalization costs after carotid revascularization. Further studies are warranted to better delineate this disparity&nbsp;to alleviate healthcare inequality and improve outcomes at safety-net hospitals.

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) has been associated with significant mortality, limb loss, and resource use. Given the presence of socioeconomic disparities in management of chronic limb ischemia, the current study examined factors associated with utilization of revascularization procedures and amputation in patients with ALI and their associated clinical outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The 2005-2017 National Inpatient Sample was used to identify hospitalizations with a diagnosis of lower extremity ALI. Patient characteristics were tabulated using coding as defined by the International Classification of Disease 9/10. The cohort was categorized as White or non-White based on self-declared race. Nonparametric test of trends (NPtrend) was used to assess temporal changes while chi-square and adjusted Wald tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Multivariable models were developed to identify independent association of covariate with outcomes which included odds of revascularization, amputations, in-hospital mortality, as well as duration (LOS) and costs of hospitalization.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 869,540 admissions with ALI (59.7% White), 66.8% required revascularization, with open approach being performed more frequently compared to endovascular (61.4 vs&nbsp;38.6%). Utilization of revascularization (65.8 in 2005 to 59.4% in 2017, NPtrend&lt;0.001) and amputation (7.8 in 2005 to 7.4% in 2017, NPtrend=0.006) decreased significantly. After adjusting for relevant patient and hospital factors, non-White race, congestive heart failure, cancer, liver disease, and chronic kidney disease were all associated with reduced odds of revascularization (FIGURE, panel A). Factors associated with increased risk of amputation included peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, weight loss, and non-White race (FIGURE, panel B). Furthermore, non-White race predicted increased odds of several other outcomes, including amputation without attempted limb salvage (AOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09-1.28), amputation after revascularization (AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.25-1.43), hospitalization cost (&beta; +$3,066, 95% CI $2,021-$4111), and LOS (&beta; +0.99 days, 95% CI 0.69-1.30). However, non-White race was not associated with a significant decrement in the odds of in-hospital mortality (AOR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88-1.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We have demonstrated significant racial disparities in the surgical management of patients admitted to US hospitals for ALI. Non-White race appears to be associated with reduced odds of revascularization but increased rates of amputation. Future studies to identify underlying factors such as access to care and advanced presentation among non-White patients are warranted in order to provide optimal and equitable care.

However, it is unknown which specific activities of daily living are significantly impacted after surgery, and whether functionality is regained over time. The objective of this study was to prospectively measure changes in functional status among patients following major and minor vascular surgery procedures.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients consented to undergo elective major and minor vascular surgery procedures at an academic medical center were prospectively identified between May 2018 and March 2019. Each patient&rsquo;s functional status was assessed using the Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) index and the Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADL) index prior to surgery and was reassessed post-operatively at 2-week, 1-month, and 1-year time points. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on individual components of ADL and iADL scores compared changes in patients&rsquo; ability to perform specific skills over time. Logistic regression models were used to identify independent predictors of functional decline at each time point.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;126 patients (59% male; mean [SD] age, 61 [17] years) were assessed before and after minor (56%) and major (44%) surgical procedures. The ability to independently undertake ADLs (bathing, dressing, and toileting) and certain iADLs (shop, prepare food, and house-keeping) was significantly decreased at both 2-weeks and at 1-month (p&lt; 0.05), but had returned to baseline at 1-year following surgery (Figure A&amp;B). In comparison, patients experienced significant deficits in the iADLs of managing laundry, transportation, medications, and finances that never return to baseline at 1-year following surgery (p&lt; 0.05, Figure B). Undergoing major surgery was associated with the greatest odds of decline in ADLs (OR:3.1; 95%CI: 1.0-8.9; P&lt;0.001) and iADLs (OR:6.8; 95% CI: 2.5-18.6; P&lt;0.001) at 2-weeks post-op, but the significance of this finding did not persist beyond 1-month.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients experience a loss in the ability to complete activities of daily living needed to remain independent in the month after vascular surgery, which is exacerbated following major procedures. While most functional skills are regained at one year after surgery, certain activities such as managing laundry, transportation, and the cognitive ability to manage finances and medications remains deficient. These data can help older patients and caretakers prepare for the types and duration of functional deficits they may be expected to incur after surgery.

Living in a Food Desert (FD) has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes; however, its impact on vascular surgery outcomes is unknown. This study hypothesized that FD status would be associated with readmission after revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This study was a single-center retrospective analysis of open and endovascular CLTI revascularization operations for years 2013-2019. FD status was defined using USDA Food Access Research criteria by ZIP code with low-income and low-access. Low-access was defined as &ge;33% of residents in the zip code living greater than 1 mile or 10 miles from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store for an urban or rural area, respectively. Bivariate analyses were performed as appropriate to the data. Binary logistic regression was performed assessing the association of FD status with unplanned 30-day readmissions.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In total, 456 cases were included, of which 9.0% (n=41) resided in a FD. Patients in the FD cohort were younger (64.2 vs 70.8, p&lt;0.01) and more likely to present with a partial ambulatory deficit (81% vs 65%, p=0.04). A FD was associated with higher rates of wound complications (51% vs 23%, p&lt;0.01) and 30-day readmissions (39% vs 21%, p&lt;0.01). Wound complications in the FD cohort were primarily new surgical incisions as opposed to index wound complications (24% vs. 10%, p&lt;0.01).&nbsp; On multivariable analysis, a FD was associated with increased odds of 30-day readmission (OR: 2.1 CI: 1.1-4.3 p=0.03) and overall wound complications (OR: 3.4 CI: 1.8-6.7 p&lt;0.01) (Table). A FD was specifically associated with increased surgical incisional and index wound complications on multivariable analysis (Table). On sensitivity analysis controlling for the interaction of income status and low-access, low-access remained associated with each endpoint. Reasons for readmission in the FD were all due to wound complications (100% vs. 60% p&lt;0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:
Living in a Food Desert was associated with more than twice the odds of 30-day readmission after lower extremity revascularization or CLTI. This increase in readmission may be explained through increased wound complications. These findings suggest FD status may impact wound healing and supports considering access to healthy food as a potentially modifiable risk factor for unplanned readmission following CLTI revascularization.

Vascular surgeons are looking after older and frailer patients with multimorbidity, who experience higher rates of perioperative mortality and morbidity. Recent guidelines recommend proactive geriatrician consultation. Preliminary results of an Australian geriatric co-management service for older vascular surgery (Gerico-V) patients admitted to hospital are reported.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Data are from an ongoing prospective before-and-after evaluation study of consecutive patients aged &ge;65 years admitted under vascular surgery at a tertiary academic hospital in Sydney, Australia. The control cohort (n=150) received usual care in which geriatricians were consulted reactively after the patient had developed complications. The intervention cohort (n=51) received a new co-management service where a geriatrician was embedded within a multidisciplinary vascular surgery team (Gerico-V). The geriatrician proactively saw all admitted vascular surgery patients aged &ge;65 years and attended a weekly multidisciplinary meeting.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Between February and October 2019, 150 consecutive patients (forming the control cohort) aged &ge;65 years were admitted under vascular surgery with a mean (SD) age of 79 (7.7) years, 68% were male, 37% were emergency admissions, and 78% underwent operative management.&nbsp; As per the Clinical Frailty Scale, 30% were frail and 37% cognitively impaired. &nbsp;Post introduction of the Gerico-V model, 51 consecutive patients aged &ge;65 years were admitted under vascular surgery from January to April 2020. This intervention group had a mean (SD) age of 81 (7.1) years, 65% were male, 55% were emergency admissions, 57% were operatively managed, 51% were frail, and 28% had cognitive impairment. Operative interventions were similar in the before and after cohorts, with endovascular intervention accounting for 51% and 46% of primary operations, respectively. Comparing outcomes before and after introduction of the geriatric co-management model of care, length of stay was similar (6.5 days vs 6.6 days), delirium was lower (10.0% vs 3.9%), inpatient mortality was lower (2.0% vs 0.0%), functional decline from admission to discharge was higher (19.0% vs 24.0%), and there were more discharges to a rehabilitation setting (8% vs 14%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Older persons admitted to a vascular surgery unit have a high prevalence of frailty and cognitive impairment. Our preliminary findings suggest that the implementation of a multidisciplinary geriatric co-management model for vascular surgery patients reduces the incidence of delirium and mortality, without impacting hospital length of stay, but there was increased incidence in functional decline during the admission, which may be explained by earlier discharge to a rehabilitation facility.

","J. Man<sup>1</sup>, J. Xu<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Iowa,Vascular Surgery,Iowa City, IA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Frailty scores are increasingly utilized to predict post-operative complications. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the administrative risk analysis index (RAI-A) can be used to predict re-intervention or mortality within 30 days in patients who undergo elective open or endovascular AAA repair.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to query data from elective open or endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs from 2011-2018. The administrative risk analysis index (RAI-A) score was calculated for each patient. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine whether there were statistical or clinical significance for incremental increases of RAI-A for both the open and endovascular repair group. Outcome measures were reintervention or death within 30 days.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Data from 4,106 and 11,733 patients who underwent open and endovascular repair, respectively, were included in the analysis.&nbsp; The number of re-interventions within 30 days was 9.1% (375 out of 4,106 patients) in the open repair group and 4.0% (463 out of 11,685 patients) in the endovascular group. Thirty day mortality was 4.7% (192 out of 4,106 patients) in the open repair group, and 0.9% (109 out of 11,685 patients) in the endovascular group. RAI-A scores were calculated for each patient. The open and endovascular repair groups had median RAI-A scores of 7 (mean 8.31) and 9 (mean 9.51) respectively. There was no significant association between RAI-A scores and outcome measures in either group.&nbsp; The C statistic of predicting 30 day reinterventions using RAI-A scores was 0.535 (OR 1.02) for the open repair group and 0.532 (OR 1.02) for endovascular repair. For predicting 30 day mortality, the C statistic was 0.626 (OR 1.07) in the open repair group and 0.701 (OR 1.09) in the endovascular repair group.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The RAI-A is not useful in predicting 30 day reintervention or mortality in patients who undergo elective open or endovascular AAA repair.

Here&nbsp;we investigate whether the pre-op severity of aneurysm calcification assessed by calcium score is associated with the sac regression after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective cohort study was conducted among the AAA patients who underwent successful EVAR at&nbsp;a single academic institute affiliated hospital between 2014-2016. Patients who had the pre-op and post-op follow up CT angiogram in the same institute without any type of endoleak after the procedure were included. Patients demographic data were&nbsp;collected. Pre-op Calcium Score were&nbsp;calculated using Agaston method. The sac regression rate (mm/year) was&nbsp;determined based on maximal diameter of the AAA in pre-op angiogram and the most recent follow up angiogram findings.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In total, 21 male and 10 female patients were found in the chart system with the mean age of 78 years old (range 58 to 92). 27 patients (87%) were White, the mean Calcium Score is 5605.79 (range 28.6 to 22473), mean sac regression rate is 9.60 mm/year (range -52.14 to 71.14). Linear regression analysis showed that pre-op calcium score is a positive predictor of sac regression rate after adjustment of age, gender and ethnicity with a coefficient value of 0.002 (P=0.013).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;In AAA, a higher pre-op calcium score is correlated with accelerated sac regression after EVAR. This may reflect that AAA with high pre-op calcium score will respond well to the EVAR procedure with greater sac regression.

Cluster-randomized trials differ from patient-level randomized trials because the unit of randomization is the &ldquo;cluster&rdquo;, such as the study site, rather than an individual patient. However, it is unknown if this will reliably produce similar groups for comparison.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we assess the distribution of patient-level covariates in a cluster-randomized trial of a decision aid for patients choosing between open and endovascular repair of AAA, the Preferences for Open Versus Endovascular Repair of AAA Study (PROVE-AAA).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We are performing a multi-center, cluster-randomized trial of a decision aid for patients choosing open or endovascular approaches when facing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns of &ldquo;contamination&rdquo; of study sites by exposure to the decision aid favored the cluster randomized design.&nbsp;&nbsp;Randomization occurred at the level of the study site (n=22), where treatment sites had exposure to a validated decision aid and control sites did not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic demographic data including common comorbidities and health status were collected on each participant enrolled.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 238 participants were randomized; 110 into the control arm and 128 into the intervention arm.&nbsp;Examination of our demographic characteristics, as the patient level, demonstrated that our cohort was primarily male (99%), white (99%) and elderly (mean age &gt;70y).&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients were commonly obese (62%, mean BMI 33.2), had hypertension (87%), diabetes (32%) and had a previous myocardial infarction (32%).&nbsp;&nbsp;Among all demographic and comorbidity covariates, there were no statistical differences between treatment and control groups at the patient level (Table 1), even though the level of randomization was at the site level.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our cluster-randomized trial of a decision aid for patients facing vascular surgery yielded equal distribution of covariates at the patient level.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cluster randomized trials in surgery can be an effective alternative when patient-level randomization strategies are not possible.

Dua<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital,Vascular Surgery,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  There is a paucity of data regarding the conversion rate from dry gangrene to wet gangrene after revascularization of the lower extremity. This study aimed to determine the rate of conversion from dry to wet gangrene within 30 days post procedure in patients who underwent endovascular or open revascularization for critical limb ischemia. Secondary aims included determining the time to conversion and associated risk factors with conversion.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A multicenter, retrospective review was performed utilizing the Partners Healthcare System&rsquo;s Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR). All adult patients who had lower extremity dry gangrene that underwent a revascularization procedures (endo, open, hybrid) from April 2002 - March 2020 were included. Patients who had no lower extremity gangrene, a concurrent amputation with the revascularization procedure, or wet gangrene on initial presentation were excluded. Datapoints included demographics, comorbidities, type of revascularization, extent of gangrene, creatinine, HBA1C, time to amputation, time to conversion, and if a procedure was performed for wet gangrene in 30 days.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 1,518 patients identified who underwent revascularization, 201 (13.2%) patients met inclusion critera and served as our study cohort. There were 51 (25.3%) conversions from dry to wet gangrene of which 18 (8.9%) patients converted within 30 days post procedure. The mean time to conversion was 11.9 &plusmn; 8.2 days. A logistic regression was performed which identified coronary artery disease as a protective variable (AOR=0.30, P-value=0.024) with male sex (AOR=3.46, P-value= 0.065) and forefoot gangrene (AOR=3.18, P-value=0.060) trending towards being possible risk factors for conversion.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The rate of dry to wet gangrene conversion post revascularization is 9% within 30 days. The mean time of conversion is 11.9 &plusmn; 8.2 days. Possible risk factors include male sex and forefoot gangrene.&nbsp;

Angiographic predictors (AP) of outcomes in chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) are ill defined.&nbsp; We quantified the effect of AP upon outcomes in the context of the Society for Vascular Surgery Wound Ischemia foot Infection (WIfI) classification.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single-center retrospective review of consecutive endovascular interventions for CLTI via a multidisciplinary team was performed.&nbsp; We obtained baseline demographics, comorbidities, procedural, WIfI and AP.&nbsp; Specifically angiosome directed revascularization (ADR; direct, indirect via collaterals, and indirect without collaterals), Kawarada classification, pedal GLASS classification, pedal arch patency, and post-procedural wound blush were obtained.&nbsp; We excluded limbs without infrapopliteal angiograms.&nbsp; The primary outcome was amputation free survival (AFS).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Over thirty months, 110 patients (60% male; median age 67 years IQR 59, 74; 117 limbs; median follow up 205 days IQR 63, 576) underwent 208 revascularizations and 67 podiatric procedures.&nbsp; Eighty limbs (68%) were WIfI stage 3/4.&nbsp; Ninety limbs (77%) were among diabetic patients, while 72 (62%) were among dialysis-dependent patients.&nbsp;&nbsp; ADR by limb was direct in 35 (30%), indirect via collaterals in 37 (32%) and indirect without collaterals in 45 (39%).&nbsp; Thirteen limbs (11%) had intact pedal arches after revascularization.&nbsp; Wound-blush was achieved in 20 limbs (17%).&nbsp; Limbs had the following Kawarada Classifications:&nbsp; 12 (10%) Class I; 34 (29%) class 2A; 23 (20%) class 2B; and 30 (26%) Class 3.&nbsp; At last available follow up, 11 limbs (9%) had undergone major amputation and twenty patients (19%) were deceased.&nbsp; One-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of AFS, survival, and limb salvage were 68%, SE + 5%; 80% SE + 5%; and 90% SE + 3%, respectively.&nbsp; On univariate analysis, ADR (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.02, 2.82; p=0.04), and WIfI Stage (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.09, 2.97; p=0.04) met criteria for model entry.&nbsp; Multivariable logistic regression revealed that only WIfI Stage independently predicted AFS (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.01, 3.52, p=0.02).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Endovascular approaches to CLTI within a multidisciplinary team can achieve 90% limb salvage, albeit with a high procedural rate.&nbsp; ADR best predicts outcomes among the angiographic variables studied.&nbsp; In contrast to WIfI clinical stage, none independently predicts outcome.

Endovascular repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (EVAR) is gaining in popularity over open surgical repair (OSR) as a result of lower postoperative morbidity/mortality and ever-improving techniques and technologies. The PReferences for Open Versus Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (PROVE-AAA) trial aimed to determine the efficacy of a validated decision aid to enable better matching between patient preference and their ultimate repair. As part of this study, we sought to determine the key factors influencing the decision making of veterans who are eligible for EVAR or OSR through qualitative, thematic analysis of survey answers to free response questions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The PROVE-AAA trial enrolled 236 veterans from 20 centers in the Veterans Administration (VA) system. Veterans were asked a series of questions eliciting their information sources regarding either repair. Their employment status and preferred intervention was also recorded. Survey answers were transcribed, individually coded, and analyzed using conventional content analysis by a team of four researchers to generate common, non-overlapping themes for each question. Results were stratified by employment status and reported using standard qualitative methodology.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
42 patients provided their source of information for OSR (17.8% of enrollees) prior to using a decision aid and 43 patients provided their source of information for EVAR prior to using a decision aid (18.2% of enrollees). When stratified by employment status, 81% of retired veterans were over 70 years old, while 58% of not-retired veterans were over 70 (p=.003). The most common responses for retired individuals and not retired (working, unemployed, and disabled) individuals involved participants receiving information for both OSR and EVAR from a vascular surgeon/professional or an unspecified MD/other health professional. Notably for both cases, patients also relied on information form non-MD medical staff and personal experience/research. Interestingly, retired individuals were more likely than not retired individuals to get information for EVAR. For respondents of both questions, the most commonly preferred procedure was EVAR. However, non-retired individuals were more likely than their retired counterparts to prefer OSR.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Patients of the PROVE-AAA study were more likely to be retired and more likely to rely on information from an unspecified MD/other health professional for EVAR. Though both retired and non-retired patients preferred EVAR the most, non-retired individuals were more likely to prefer OSR despite being younger and OSR&rsquo;s need for longer post operative recovery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was a single-center retrospective review of patients who presented with CLTI and underwent LEB between April 2016 and October 2019.&nbsp; Delirium was identified via chart review using previously described methodology.&nbsp; Cognitive impairment and depression were identified by diagnosis codes.&nbsp; Associations between delirium and baseline characteristics and post-operative outcomes were tested using bivariate analysis.&nbsp; The independent association of delirium with NHD was tested using multivariable binary logistic regression.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Delirium developed in 30 (35%) of the 85 patients identified. The median patient age was 70 (IQR 61, 81), 62% were Caucasian and 62% were male (all p&gt;0.01). On bivariate analysis, increased delirium was associated with age &gt; 79 years (47% vs. 22%, p=0.02), depression (43% vs. 22%, p=0.04) and cognitive impairment (33% vs. 4%, p &lt;0.001); decreased delirium was associated with diabetes (37% vs. 60%, p=0.04), preoperative Plavix (10% vs. 36%, p=0.01), and preoperative ACE inhibitors/ARBs (23% vs. 55%, p=0.01). Post-operatively, delirium was associated with an increased length-of-stay (15.1 days [SD 20.7] vs. 5.8 days [SD 2.5], p=0.001), non-home discharge (63% vs. 31%, p=0.004) and increased post-operative complications (48% vs. 22%, p=0.01). Multivariable analysis for NHD showed delirium was associated with increased NHD (OR=3.2, p=0.04, AUC=0.80). Consultation for delirium occurred in 13 (43%) patients with delirium.&nbsp; Pharmacy was most often consulted (10/13), although no changes to care resulted.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Delirium is common after LEB for CLTI and associated with increased hospital resources including increased length-of-stay, post-operative complications, and non-home discharge. No patients received specialty consultation for delirium management and no care was changed after pharmacy consultation only.&nbsp; Future studies should address how delirium-prevention programs and specialty consultation may prevent or diminish delirium&rsquo;s impact in high-risk patients after LEB for CLTI.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a manifestation of atherosclerosis associated with diminished quality of life, increased risk of limb loss, adverse cardiovascular events, and death. Management of risk factors is a central tenet of PAD treatment. Poor patient understanding of risk factors impedes the adoption of recommended lifestyle or behavioral recommendations. Based on the high prevalence of advanced PAD, we hypothesized that patients with PAD have inadequate understanding of its risk factors and consequences.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Over a 7-week period at a single center, we surveyed 72 consecutive patients in the vascular surgery outpatient clinic with a pre-existing diagnosis of PAD. The survey assessed demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical information. The survey also assessed knowledge of their diagnosis and its risk factors and outcomes. Additional clinical history was obtained from the electronic medical record. Survey results were summarized using standard descriptive statistics.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 64 patients completed the survey (ages 30-100; 36% women); 8 patients declined to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reported PAD symptoms included claudication (53%) and rest pain (47%). Most patients have had PAD-related surgery, including lower extremity (LE) revascularization (72%), major LE amputation (15.6%), and minor LE amputation (17%). Overall, only 64% patients correctly indicated that they had been diagnosed with PAD, a proportion which was not impacted by a history of revascularization or amputation. In contrast, patient history of diabetes mellitus, stroke, and heart attack were correctly reported in 95%, 92%, and 80% of patients, respectively. The relationship of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking to PAD was correctly identified by only 63%, 64%, 69%, and 56% of patients, respectively. Only 60-73% understood that PAD is associated with limb loss, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. Most patients (81%) expressed a desire to learn more about PAD, and 74% preferred to learn about it from their physicians. The preferred modes of learning materials were paper (51%), web-based (40%), and patient education sessions (25%). Topics about which patients desired to learn were the causes of PAD (71%), treatment for PAD (62%), and behaviors and health conditions associated with PAD (62%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

PAD patients have major knowledge deficits about their disease. The stark difference between knowledge of PAD and related comorbidities highlights a critical deficiency in patient education, which in most patients persists even after major vascular surgery. This pilot study identifies key content and patient preference regarding mode of delivery for patient education materials. Future interventions to improve frequency and efficacy of the education provided by physicians to patients in this population could significantly impact the natural history of the disease and improve patient outcomes.

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, many patients have delayed medical care for fear of contracting COVID-19. These decisions may be further influenced by governmental Stay-at-Home Orders (SAHO) driven by increases in COVID-19 cases. We aimed to study the impact of such measures on pediatric appendicitis patients, hypothesizing that there would be a delay in care and an associated increase in severity of appendicitis at presentation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective cohort study was conducted of pediatric (age&lt;18 years) appendectomy cases for acute appendicitis at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital in a major United States city from 12/1/2019 to 6/30/2020. A countywide SAHO was enacted on 3/24/2020. Patients who presented before this SAHO were compared to those who presented after. Demographics, clinical presentation, operative details, and patient outcomes within 30 post-operative days were extracted from the medical record. Appendicitis severity was classified as perforated or not perforated (simple or gangrenous) based on the surgeon&rsquo;s intraoperative diagnosis. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses (utilizing meaningful variable selection, P&lt;0.2) were performed. P&lt;0.05 was considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of 248 patients who underwent appendectomy, 135 (54.4%) cases occurred prior to the SAHO and 113 (45.6%) occurred after the order. Five patients were excluded; four for incidental appendectomy and one for failed nonoperative treatment at another hospital. Patients were similar by age, gender, race, weight, comorbidities and insurance status. Patient-reported symptom duration, Pediatric Appendicitis Scores, and admission white blood cell count (WBC) were similar between the groups (Table). The Post SAHO group had a higher rate of perforated appendicitis cases (42.5%) compared to the Pre SAHO group (23.7%), p=0.002, and had a longer median length of stay (Table). There were similar post-operative complications between the groups including emergency department visits, readmissions, surgical site infections, small bowel obstruction,&nbsp;and reoperations (Table). On adjusted regression analysis, Post SAHO presentation was still associated with a diagnosis of perforated appendicitis (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3-4.0).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The global COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent regional lockdowns continue to have an impact on all areas of healthcare. This study shows that in pediatric appendicitis cases following a local SAHO, patients presented with a similar timeline of reported symptom duration, but had a longer hospital length of stay and over twice the odds of presenting with perforated appendicitis. Future disaster/pandemic preparedness strategies must account for such effects and disruptions in healthcare.

However, there is conflicting data regarding its effectiveness as rescue therapy in acute severe colitis. Furthermore, most studies were conducted in adults, and pediatric onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with more severe disease that may be less amenable to rescue therapy. We reviewed our experience with pediatric severe colitis and report outcomes following attempted rescue therapy with infliximab.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review was conducted of patients with UC or indeterminate colitis who received rescue infliximab therapy at our institution from January 2000-January 2019. Rescue infliximab therapy was considered if a child failed non-biologic therapy or progressed to fulminant or toxic colitis. Primary outcome was failed rescue therapy resulting in colectomy. Secondary outcomes included number of admissions, antibiotic utilization, total parental nutrition (TPN) days, number of blood transfusions, imaging, number of laboratory tests, days of intravenous steroids, and length of stay. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA and a p-value of &lt;0.05 determined significance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Thirty patients met inclusion criteria. The median age at administration of rescue infliximab treatment was 14.5 years [IQR 13, 17]. Rescue therapy with infliximab was successful in 33% (n=10), while 67% (n=20) underwent colectomy. Comparisons of clinical characteristics of those with successful infliximab rescue versus those who underwent colectomy are shown in Table 1. Children on maintenance steroids were less likely to have successful rescue with infliximab and require colectomy (p=0.03). Possibly indicative of rescue therapy failure, children requiring colectomy had a longer hospital stay (p=0.03), more abdominal radiographs (p=0.01), and were on a longer duration of antibiotics (p=&lt;0.01) compared to children who were successfully rescued with infliximab. There was no difference between children successfully rescued with infliximab and those who required colectomy with regards to vital signs or lab abnormalities, specifically white blood cell count and electrolyte values.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Infliximab as rescue therapy is ineffective in two-thirds of pediatric patients with severe colitis and does not have the potential for long-term cure. A response is more likely when patients are not on steroids at the time of admission.

Markel<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Indiana University School Of Medicine,Pediatric Surgery,Indianapolis, IN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is an inflammatory disease of the bowel in patients with underlying Hirschsprung disease (HD), and is the most frequent potentially life-threatening complication of HD. We sought to evaluate the clinical characteristics most associated with the development of HAEC, and to investigate risk factors for HAEC following pull-through operation. We hypothesized that patient-level factors such as comorbidities, higher level of care requirement at the time of operation, and age at operation would be associated with a higher prevalence of HAEC.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective cohort study of the Pediatric Health Information System database for all patients with Hirschsprung disease who underwent a pull-through operation was performed. Preoperative and postoperative encounters for enterocolitis were considered. Statistical analysis was performed on this cohort utilizing logistic regression methods to identify cohort characteristics most closely associated with the development of HAEC. A p value of &lt;0.05 was statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We evaluated 6221 patients with Hirschsprung disease who underwent a pull-through procedure. These patients were predominantly male (76.6%) and white (59.51%) with a primary mix of insurance payers between Medicaid (49.0%) and commercial (40.2%) insurance providers. There were 4487 separate encounters for enterocolitis. Comorbid congenital/genetic defects (OR=1.33, p&lt;0.001) and Medicaid as primary insurance (OR=1.17, p=0.013) were positively correlated with HAEC encounters, while the presence of a neurologic/neuromuscular disorder was negatively correlated with HAEC (OR=0.7, p=0.045). Post-operatively, NICU stay during index operation (OR=0.017, p&lt;0.001), &ldquo;other&rdquo; insurance &ndash; that is, specifically designated as non-Medicaid, non-commercial (OR=0.48, p=0.014) - and age at pull-through less than 1 year (OR=0.23, p&lt;0.001) were negatively correlated with HAEC. We tabulated a total charge of $193,028,189.20 for all post-operative encounters, or $3,374.56 per patient-year. The most common diagnoses for subsequent inpatient admissions were: Hirschsprung disease (25.6%, average cost=$9235.74), HAEC (4.7%, average=$7399.21) and dehydration (2.8%, average=$8874.53).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The diagnosis of HAEC remains nebulous, but several patient-level factors are distinctly associated with the development of this complication. Directed patient care initiatives may be utilized for those patients who may be at a higher risk of future HAEC admission. Further study is warranted to fully examine the burdensome nature of this disorder.&nbsp;

We have previously demonstrated that when considering urgent operations for their children, parents prefer surgeon guidance as opposed to autonomous decision making.&nbsp; Here, we interview parents of pediatric patients who have undergone urgent operations to gain a more nuanced understanding of decision-making preferences when parents engage in urgent surgical decision-making for their children.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We identified parents of pediatric patients who had undergone surgery at a University based, tertiary children&rsquo;s hospital in the past 5 years for cancer, an urgent operation while in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).&nbsp; Parents were contacted and invited to participate in a 60-minute semi-structured interview.&nbsp; Interviews were conducted with 12 parents of 12 pediatric surgical patients.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Thematic saturation was achieved after 12 interviews (4 cancer, 5 NICU, 3 ECMO). &nbsp;&nbsp;All parents felt that their child had undergone at least one urgent operation.&nbsp; 11 patients were alive at the time of interview.&nbsp; Five key themes emerged from these urgent operation scenarios: (1) Most parents felt that it was helpful to have a recommendation from their child&rsquo;s surgeon; (2) All parents expressed that they did not feel like there was a decision to be made; (3) Most parents appreciated being provided a handout, brochure, protocol, or drawing as opposed to receiving only verbal information; (4) All parents defined shared decision making as &ldquo;dialogue,&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;discussion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;having an option&rdquo;&nbsp; and generally felt as if they had shared in the decision making process with the surgeon despite feeling that there was no decision to be made; (5) All parents valued the opportunity to ask questions and viewed this as having a &ldquo;valued voice&rdquo; to advocate for their children.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;When engaging in decision making regarding urgent surgical procedures for their children, parents want the surgeon to provide a recommendation.&nbsp; Parents feel that engaging in dialogue or discussion with the surgeon defines shared decision making, and they believe that the opportunity to ask questions gives them a &ldquo;valued voice,&rdquo; even when they do not feel as if there is a specific decision to be made.&nbsp; These key themes will be used to develop a decision-making tool that parents can use to more effectively engage in discussions regarding surgical decision making for their children.

Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,The Smith Child Health Research Program,,Chicago, ILLINOIS, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Despite nearly three million pediatric operations performed in the United States annually, normal post-operative recovery patterns remain difficult to define. Wearables that objectively and passively assess physical activity in real time represent a novel tool to assess postoperative recovery. Wearables data have been used to predict onset of complications in adults, but these devices may be particularly useful in pediatric patients for whom proxies may inaccurately assess recovery, resulting in untimely care. Currently little is known about acceptance and utility of wearables in children undergoing surgery. This pilot study aimed to examine the feasibility of using the FitBit&reg;, a commercially available wearable that measures physical activity, to describe post-operative recovery in children after appendectomy, the most utilized inpatient surgical procedure in children, and determine the utility of accelerometer data to describe differences in recovery based on disease severity (complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Children ages 3-18 years old undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis at our institution over a 4 month period were invited to participate post-operatively. Continuous minute-by-minute heart rate (to establish wear time) and step count data (to assess physical activity) were collected for 21 days after application of the wrist-worn FitBit&reg; accelerometer immediately after surgery. Descriptive analyses of patient demographics and daily step count data were performed. Growth curve analysis was conducted to model trajectories of complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis patient recovery courses indicated by daily step counts.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 32 patients enrolled, 26 met the eligibility criteria and were included in data analysis. In this sample, 9 (35%) patients had complicated appendicitis and 14 (54%) were female; the mean age was 9.1 years (SD: 2.9). A total of 419 post-operative days were captured in these patients (range of 8 to 22 days per patient; median of 16 days). Daily step counts increased after surgery and were higher for uncomplicated appendectomy patients (Figure 1). The growth curve model showed that uncomplicated appendectomy patients had significantly higher recovery trajectories based on step count compared to complicated patients (p=0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This pilot study has demonstrated that FitBit&reg; use is feasible after surgery in children and can distinguish recovery trajectories based on disease severity in the immediate post-operative period. Establishing &ldquo;normal&rdquo; surgical recovery may lead to improved outpatient monitoring and earlier detection of complications.

Somers<sup>1</sup>, A. Mokdad<sup>1</sup>, K. Van Arendonk<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Medical College of Wisconsin,Department Of Surgery,Milwaukee, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Lower socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked to poorer outcomes for a variety of medical and surgical conditions among children. A higher risk of complicated appendicitis, often used as a surrogate for delay in care, has also been linked to lower SES. However, this finding has been inconsistent across individual children&rsquo;s hospitals and has been reliant on inexact SES measures such as zip code-level median household income. The objective of this study was to measure the association between a more granular measure of SES and presentation with complicated appendicitis among children.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Clinical and demographic characteristics for all patients treated for acute appendicitis at a large freestanding children&rsquo;s hospital between 2015-2019 were reviewed. Patient home addresses were mapped to census block groups and linked to a neighborhood-level marker of SES called the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), which incorporates income, education, employment, and housing quality. Home addresses were also used to calculate travel time from patient home to children&rsquo;s hospital. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare the likelihood of having complicated appendicitis across ADI while adjusting for confounders.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;During the study period, 1,671 children were treated for acute appendicitis, of which 638 (38.2%) had complicated disease. Compared to those with uncomplicated disease, children with complicated disease were younger (median age 10.3 [IQR 7.0-13.4] vs. 12.0 [IQR 9.4-14.8] years, p&lt;0.001) and more likely to have public insurance (51.4% vs. 41.7%, p&lt;0.001), live &gt;60 minutes from the children&rsquo;s hospital (17.1% vs. 11.8%, p&lt;0.001), and have prior emergency department visits in the 30 days preceding diagnosis (8.8% vs. 4.5%, p&lt;0.001). Children with complicated appendicitis disproportionately came from more disadvantaged neighborhoods (p&lt;0.005), with 33% of those with complicated disease coming from the two most disadvantaged ADI deciles. Adjusted for age, gender, race, travel time, and insurance, the odds of perforated disease rose by 6% per increase in ADI decile (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.06, 95%CI 1.01-1.10, p=0.01). Younger age and &gt;60 minutes travel time were also strongly associated with complicated appendicitis. The association between ADI and complicated appendicitis remained among children less than 10 years old (aOR 1.08, 95%CI 1.00-1.16, p=0.04) and those living within 30 minutes from the children&rsquo;s hospital (aOR 1.06, 95%CI 1.01-1.11, p=0.02).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;ADI, a salient measure of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage, is associated with complicated disease among children presenting with acute appendicitis. As complicated appendicitis is often a proxy for delay in care, ADI may be a valuable measure of difficulty accessing timely surgical care among disadvantaged children.

While children are affected by both direct and indirect consequences of the opioid epidemic, uniform protocols for opioid prescribing practices in children undergoing surgical procedures are often lacking. The goal of this study was to evaluate the patterns in the prescription of pain medication following common pediatric surgeries in order to identify targets for quality improvement.&nbsp; We hypothesize that amounts of&nbsp;opioids prescribed has decreased in the wake of increased awareness, but that practice patterns are widely variable.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A single-institution retrospective review of pediatric patients (&lt;18 years) was conducted.&nbsp; Data were abstracted from 2012-2019 and entered into a RedCap database for appendectomy, umbilical hernia repair, inguinal hernia repair, circumcision, laparoscopic gastrostomy (+/- fundoplication), laparoscopic cholecystectomy, orchiopexy, and abscess or pilonidal drainage. Patients were excluded if discharged from a long-term ICU, hospital discharge &gt;7 days postoperatively, conversion to major laparotomy, or chronic narcotic use. Variables included demographics, medical history, operative course and discharge medications. Univariate and multivariate analysis evaluated trends in opioid prescriptions with subanalyses performed to identify differences by race, gender, or insurance status. A linear regression model was created to model mean total opioid doses by time. Non-linear polynomial modeling with a 5-knot restricted cubic spine fit was developed to best show the change in prescription patterns over time.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1865 cases met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 9.3 years, and patients were predominantly male (61.5%), white (66.6%), and insured by Medicaid (63.9%). Average post-op stay was 1.5 days. 1157 patients were prescribed an opioid on discharge. Mean number of opioids prescribed (defined as total number of doses) decreased over time from 24 in 2012 to 2 in 2019 (p&lt;0.001). All subcategories decreased, with hernia repairs showing the least amount of change. When controlling for other factors, time and procedure were both significantly associated with opioid dose (p&lt;.0001). Time analysis showed a decrease in opioid prescribing from 2012-2014, plateau until 2017, and further decrease until 2019 (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Opioid prescription in post-operative patients decreased over time despite no pediatric-specific opioid prescribing protocols. This may be due to advocacy, awareness, or legislation, and the influence of these factors on prescribing practice requires further investigation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  National cohort study of patients within the NSQIP&ndash;Pediatric database who underwent inpatient surgery (2012-2016). &nbsp;Complications were categorized based on when they occurred relative to discharge: &nbsp;only pre-discharge; only post-discharge; both. The main outcomes were FTR and unplanned readmission within 30-days. &nbsp;The association between perioperative outcomes and the timing of postoperative complications was evaluated with multivariable logistic regression.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Among 200,554 surgical inpatients, 27,726 (13.8%) had at least one postoperative complication.&nbsp; Among patients with complications, 36.7%, 21.9%, and 40.6% had complications only pre-discharge, only post-discharge, and both, respectively. &nbsp;FTR was highest among patients with pre-discharge complications (7.2%) and lowest among patients with complications both before and after discharge (0.1%). &nbsp;Readmission was highest among patients with post-discharge complications (52.7%) and lowest among patients with pre-discharge complications (4.9%). &nbsp;Relative to patients with no complications, pre-discharge (Odds Ratio [OR] 11.45, 95% confidence interval [9.78 &ndash; 13.39]) and post-discharge (OR 2.10 [1.36 &ndash; 3.22]) complications were associated with significantly increased odds of FTR.&nbsp; By comparison, patients with complications occurring both before and after discharge had significantly lower odds of FTR (OR 0.12 [0.06 &ndash; 0.24]). &nbsp;Post-discharge complications were associated with significantly increased odds of readmission (OR 23.01 [21.70 &ndash; 24.33]) as were complications occurring both before and after discharge (OR 1.92 [1.78 &ndash; 2.06]), although the magnitude of the effect was lower.&nbsp; By comparison, pre-discharge complications were associated with a significantly lower odds of readmission (OR 0.88 [0.81 &ndash; 0.98]).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Among pediatric surgical patients, the timing of post-operative complications relative to discharge is differentially associated with FTR (pre-discharge) and readmission (post-discharge). &nbsp;These differences suggest QI interventions directed at FTR should focus on patients during the index surgical admission while interventions directed at readmission should likely focus on patients undergoing operations associated with short length of stay, but high morbidity. &nbsp;Furthermore, the effects identified in patients with complications both before and after discharge, suggest that improving pre-discharge education and post-discharge monitoring might represent opportunities to avoid potentially preventable readmissions or mortality.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We conducted a cross-sectional survey of former patients evaluated for MMC repair at a quaternary fetal center between 2012 and 2019. Patients who chose to terminate their pregnancy did not receive a survey.&nbsp; The survey included questions related to sociodemographics, obstetrician and fetal center counseling, and the Decision Regret Scale, a validated tool to determine if patients had regret about their choice of MMC management.&nbsp; The survey data was analyzed using descriptive statistics.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 189 surveys distributed, 76 patients (40%) responded and were included in the analysis.&nbsp; Of the 76, 56 underwent prenatal MMC repair.&nbsp; Respondents who underwent fetal MMC repair were similar to those who had postnatal repair in age, race/ethnicity, insurance status, household income, educational level, marriage and employment status (all p&gt;0.05). More than 1/3 of respondents (36%) were influenced by social services in deciding between fetal and postnatal repair.&nbsp; Respondents who underwent fetal repair were more likely to have their decision influenced by social support (91% vs 32%, p=&lt;0.001), and partner/spouse and family support followed by social group support most commonly influenced their decision.&nbsp; 25% of respondents in the fetal repair group were influenced in their decision by housing availability.&nbsp; The median out-of-pocket expenses to undergo the fetal center evaluation were $1,500 (550-3500) for fetal repair patients and $1,000 (200-1500) for postnatal repair patients (p=0.201).&nbsp;&nbsp; 5% of respondents (n=4) reported that financial barriers prevented them from choosing the best option for them and their baby.&nbsp; Most (94%) reported that they made the right decision between fetal and postnatal repair; however, 3 respondents who underwent fetal repair reported that the choice caused them a lot of harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While fetal MMC repair has been proven to improve outcomes in children with spina bifida, there remain socioeconomic challenges for pregnant women to undergo fetal MMC repair.&nbsp; However, most respondents were happy with their decision between fetal and postnatal MMC repair.&nbsp;

The World Health Organization declared the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) a pandemic in March of 2020. Following this declaration, many states issued restrictions on travel, formal stay-at-home orders were put into effect, and hospital systems began cancelling non-emergent surgeries. During this time, we anecdotally noted that our pediatric surgery service was admitting more cases of perforated appendicitis. Therefore, we hypothesize that during the months following the COVID-19 pandemic declaration, more children were presenting with perforated appendicitis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective chart review for all pediatric patients admitted at a single institution with a diagnosis of acute and/or perforated appendicitis defined by preoperative imaging and/or operative findings from October 2019 to May 2020 was performed. Interval appendectomies were excluded. COVID-19 months were designated as March, April, and May 2020, as these months had the highest active stay-at-home orders in place. Additional analysis of March, April, and May of 2019 was performed for comparison purposes. Analyzed data included patient demographics, symptom durations, white blood cell count, imaging findings, procedures performed, and perforation status. Post-operative perforation status was confirmed with pathology. Statistical analysis was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
During the consecutive study period, 285 patients were admitted with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis with 95 patients having perforated appendicitis. The pre-COVID-19 group had 182 patients and the remaining 103 patients comprised the COVID-19 months. Demographics were similar between the two groups. Using univariate analysis, we identified a significant increase in number of perforated appendicitis cases in the three COVID-19 months compared with the preceding five months (45.6% vs 26.4%; p &lt;0.001). A similar significant increase was identified when comparing COVID-19 months to the same months a year prior (p = 0.003). Lastly, the patients with perforated appendicitis presenting during the COVID-19 months had nearly twice the readmission rates than those from five months prior.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated stay-at-home orders have had downstream effects on healthcare. Our review has demonstrated a significant increase in the number of children presenting with perforated appendicitis following the institution of these state ordinances. A delay or a reluctance to seek care due to fear of being exposed to the COVID-19 virus may result in more severe illness from appendicitis. These results demonstrate that further investigations into the issues surrounding access to healthcare, especially during this pandemic, are warranted.

Despite increased awareness surrounding opioid stewardship, data to guide optimal postoperative opioid prescribing are lacking for children undergoing surgery.&nbsp; The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) data collection platform offers a unique opportunity to gather information about current pediatric perioperative pain practices and opioid prescribing. Effectiveness of postoperative pain management can be assessed by patient surveys including PROMIS<sup>&reg; </sup>measures.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
In addition to the standard NSQIP-P data, a certified surgical clinical reviewer collected 24 novel data elements about perioperative pain practices for patients ages 5-18 years old undergoing surgery at a free-standing children&rsquo;s hospital between February and June 2020.&nbsp; Surveys about prescribed opioid use and pain-related PROMIS<sup>&reg; </sup>measures were sent to patients and their parents, by email, on post-operative days (POD) 7 and 30.&nbsp; Univariate analyses, Chi-square, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were performed, when appropriate, to describe predictors of opioid prescribing and to assess effectiveness of pain management.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 588 patients selected for standard NSQIP-P data collection over the study period, we identified 292 patients (49.6%) for inclusion in our study.&nbsp; Mean abstraction time of new variables decreased from 15 to 5 minutes per patient over the study period. &nbsp;Of the 292 patients, 89 (31%) were prescribed opioids at discharge. &nbsp;&nbsp;Factors associated with prescribed opioids included age (median 13.8y (11.4, 16) vs 11.6y (8.3, 14.6) p&lt;0.001), undergoing spinal arthrodesis or pectus excavatum repair (p&lt;0.001), and undergoing inpatient surgery (p&lt;0.05).&nbsp; Median morphine milligram equivalent (MME)/day prescribed was 45 (interquartile range (IQR) 30 MME/day) for those with opioid pills, and 23.7 for opioid liquids (IQR 14.7 MME/day).&nbsp; Two patients (2%) received opioid prescriptions for &gt;100 MME/day.&nbsp; 47 (17%) received pre-operative non-opioid pain adjuncts and &lt;30% received regional or epidural blocks pre- or intraoperatively.&nbsp; Survey completion was 15.7% (46) on POD 7 and 5% (15) on POD 30.&nbsp; 19 patients reported receiving an opioid prescription, and all 19 reported filling the prescription. Reported median worst pain score at POD 7 was higher for opioid users (U) [24 (IQR 62)] than for opioid non-users (NU) [3 (IQR 18),&nbsp;(p&lt;0.05)];&nbsp; median PROMIS&reg; t-score for pain interference was not different between the two groups&nbsp;[50.9 (IQR 24) U vs 43.3 (IQR 14.9) NU, p=0.14].

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The NSQIP-P platform is a feasible option for collecting data on pediatric perioperative pain management and opioid-prescribing practices. Second, postoperative PROs yield valuable information around effects of pain management practices.&nbsp; Further investigation and expansion of this study is required to improve PRO response rates and inform optimal prescribing practices.

The utility of such protocols in children is unknown. Our aims were to evaluate how pediatric surgeons integrate contrast-based protocols in their approach to ASBO in children and understand how surgeons make clinical and operative decisions.&nbsp;
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We administered a web-based survey using REDCap&reg; to all practicing pediatric surgeons at nine children&rsquo;s hospitals comprising the Western Pediatric Surgery Research Consortium. Questions queried surgeon management of pediatric ASBO including standard approach, knowledge of enteral water-soluble contrast protocols in adults, and attitudes towards incorporation of contrast-based protocols for pediatric ASBO management. The survey included three open ended questions. Two authors reviewed all open-ended responses. They identified themes for each of the three questions and used a conventional content analysis approach to categorize responses based on these themes.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The response rate was 66% (67/101). Thirty-six surgeons (56%) reported practicing for &gt;10 years. Overall, 93% reported peritonitis is an indication for operation. Surgeons in practice for &gt;10 years were more likely to indicate peritonitis, elevated white blood cell count, or elevated lactate were indications for operative intervention compared to surgeons in practice for &lt;10 years (p&lt;0.05 for all three comparisons). Approximately half (55%) reported they use contrast-based protocols to guide ASBO management either routinely or occasionally.&nbsp; Further details of protocol use are shown in Table 1. Five themes emerged when surgeons were asked why they used these protocols: to help with operative decision making (n=20), support of adult data (n=6), therapeutic benefit (n=4), to avoid unnecessary operation (n=3), and to standardize care (n=1). Three themes emerged when asked about the integration of adult-based data into pediatric practice: lack of pediatric specific data (n=5), compelling ideas presented in the adult literature are applicable to pediatric populations (n=33), and adult evidence should to be carefully adapted for pediatric populations (n=32).
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Based on these data we conclude that: senior surgeons are more likely to use laboratory and peritonitis as indications for surgery; survey data can help to elucidate how pediatric surgeons incorporate adult based evidence into their practice and identify barriers to clinical research in pediatric surgery; wide variation exists in attitudes and factors used to make clinical decisions in children with ASBO; further studies of contrast-based protocols for ASBO management in pediatric populations are warranted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Categorical and continuous variables were analyzed by Chi-square and t-tests, respectively.&nbsp; Multivariable logistic regression evaluated for variable independence. Data were presented as mean and standard deviation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

In 127 girls, 138 operations were performed. 150 adnexae were examined by a pathologist. 155 pathologies were identified (Table 1). Of the 138 operations, 41 (29.1%) were converted to open,&nbsp;associated with&nbsp;larger lesions, 9.1 (4.0) vs. 5.3 (3.2) cm; p&lt;0.01. Eleven (8.7%) had bilateral pathology:&nbsp;7/11&nbsp;(63.6%) had bilateral synchronous mature cystic teratomas&nbsp;(MCTs),&nbsp;2/11 (18.2%) had synchronous bilateral pathology, and 2/11 (18.2%) had metachronous bilateral lesions. Most adnexa were preserved (21/22, 95.5%).

The oophorectomy rate was 26/127 (20.5%). Oophorectomy was significantly associated with younger age (p&lt;0.01); pre-menarche status (p=0.02); imaging findings of calcifications (p=0.01) and solid components (p&lt;0.01); and a pathologic finding of an MCT (p&lt;0.01).&nbsp;&nbsp;

Male pediatric surgeons&#39;&nbsp;oophorectomy rate was 4.4 times that of female surgeons (p = 0.01, 95% CI:&nbsp;1.4-13.7).&nbsp; Torsion, observed in 54/127 (42.5%), was not associated with oophorectomy (p=0.12) (Table 1).

Post fellowship&nbsp;years (p=0.13), operation time of day (p=0.46), and comparison of early vs. late time periods (p=0.09) were not associated with oophorectomy.&nbsp; Spillage was recorded in 21/138 (15.2%) operations, 6 converted to open (28.6%), but was not associated with oophorectomy (p=0.77).

Logistic regression revealed that those who underwent cystectomy were 96% (OR .04, 95% CI: .01-.18) less likely to have an oophorectomy; however, those with a mature teratoma were 5.3 times (95% CI:&nbsp;2.1-13.0)&nbsp;more likely to have an oophorectomy.&nbsp;
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
For girls with benign adnexal pathology undergoing a laparoscopic approach, oophorectomy is independently associated with MCT&nbsp;or male surgeon. The ovary is more likely to be preserved if cystectomy is performed;&nbsp;therefore, we recommend cystectomy wherever feasible.

Jackson<sup>1</sup>, D. E. Leshikar<sup>1</sup>, J. T. Stephenson<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - Davis,Pediatric Surgery,Sacramento, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Trauma is the leading cause of death in children. Blunt abdominal injuries occur in 10-15% of pediatric trauma patients, resulting in solid organ injuries which are often managed non-operatively. Blunt solid organ injuries have historically been managed with in-hospital bedrest for the grade of injury plus one day. Recent work has demonstrated that a shorter length of stay is safe, however this is not well studied in a dual trauma center setting. We hypothesized that implementation of an accelerated blunt solid organ injury protocol would decrease length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization cost without an increase in morbidity or mortality.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective review of patients under 15 years of age presenting to a dual level 1 pediatric and adult trauma center between 2015 and 2019 with blunt trauma liver and splenic injuries was performed. Patients presenting prior to protocol implementation in April 2018 were compared to those who presented after implementation. Protocol patients were admitted to the ward or the intensive care unit (ICU) based on hemodynamic status and injury grade. Diet and activity were advanced based on hemodynamic status and abdominal exam. Patients were discharged when they were hemodynamically stable, tolerating a diet and had stable hematocrits on lab draws. Hospitalization cost data was available for patients presenting from 2016 onwards. The primary outcome was total hospital LOS. Secondary outcomes were ICU LOS, cost of hospitalization, readmission and mortality rates.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;87 patients were evaluated, 67 pre-protocol and 20 post-protocol. There was no difference in age, injury severity score, liver injury grade or spleen injury grade between the groups. LOS was significantly shorter in the post-protocol group (2 days vs. 4 days, p=0.015). The ICU LOS was unchanged. There was a decrease in direct hospitalization cost per patient from $6,246 pre-protocol to $3,810 post-protocol (p=0.030). There were no deaths and no readmissions.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Implementation of an accelerated pathway for management of blunt solid organ injury in pediatric patients at a dual trauma center was associated with decreased length of stay and decreased costs with no increased morbidity or mortality.

Pandya<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,Pediatric Surgery/Surgery,Dallas, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;With an astronomical rise in healthcare costs over the past few decades, surgeons should find ways to provide high-quality clinical care without excess costs. Surgeons, however, often lack the necessary data to achieve this goal. Every part of a patient&rsquo;s surgical experience is associated with costs unbeknownst to treating clinician.&nbsp;Standardization of surgical supplies have been shown to reduce costs. Herein, we sought to determine the variance in costs associated with laparoscopic appendectomy in a large tertiary pediatric hospital.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A single center prospective observational study of pediatric patients undergoing appendectomy was performed. 36 appendectomies performed by 11 faculty surgeons were directly observed. Surgical supplies and operative times&nbsp;were recorded. The actual cost per case was thus derived and correlated to&nbsp;clinical outcomes, such as complications and 30-day readmission rate.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The average supply cost per case ranged from $353.23 to $1,122.22 with an average incision to close time ranging from 30 to 53 min. Increased complexity of the case (i.e., complicated appendicitis) had little to no bearing on the total supply cost, but often increased operative time. The variance between individual surgeon&rsquo;s mean cost and that of the most cost effective surgeon calculated. This was then multiplied by the yearly case volume of the surgeon and the total cost savings calculated. This resulted in a cumulative&nbsp;potential cost savings of $379,047 at our center. There were no significant differences in outcomes between the most and least cost effective surgeons.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;By adopting the lean methodology, surgeons can eliminate waste and transition to providing value-based care for patients undergoing this high-volume procedure. Reducing supply costs and operative times remain the best factors under surgeon&rsquo;s control within the operating room.&nbsp;Implementing a standardized preference card for performing appendectomies can reduce cost without compromising patient outcomes.

This study aims to describe the frequency, distribution, outcomes, and referral patterns of gastroschisis patients in Northern Ghana.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This hospital-based retrospective study included data on all neonatal surgical conditions admitted at Tamale Teaching Hospital (TTH) Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) between 2014 and 2019. Descriptive statistics were performed in SAS and Excel. Flow maps of referral patterns and time travel calculations were performed with ArcGIS. Travel patterns were analyzed in two timepoints. First timepoint, from the patient&rsquo;s home to a local hospital. Second timepoint, from the local hospital to TTH.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;From a total of 360 neonates admitted at TTH NICU for surgical conditions, 3.3% (n=12) were diagnosed with gastroschisis. Around 60% of the gastroschisis patients presented with low and very low birth weight and 90% were referred from other hospitals, traveling 4 hours, on average. In the first timepoint, all patients were admitted to a hospital within their region. In the second timepoint, about 50% of gastroschisis patients were referred from hospitals in the Upper East region (UER),&nbsp; 40% from hospitals in the Northern region (NR), and 10% from hospitals in the North East region (NER). Overall, only 35% of expected cases were reported. Discharge rates were very low for the patients from NER and UER, while the NR reported a 100% mortality rate. Around 90% of gastroschisis patients died during their first week of life.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;There is a huge need for improving access to surgical care and reducing neonatal mortality related to gastroschisis in Northern Ghana. This study provides a baseline towards optimizing care for neonates with gastroschisis in Northern Ghana. Priority areas to improve gastroschisis outcomes may include special focus on management of small newborns, better communication channels between referring hospitals and TTH, increase access to available, affordable and safe transport for gastroschisis patients, and empowerment of community health workers to promote timely seeking of surgical care.

Ileocolic intussusception is a common cause of pediatric bowel obstruction, and without treatment can result in bowel necrosis and death. Contrast enema is successful in treating 75% of patients, and if initially unsuccessful, 34% may be reduced with repeat enemas. This has been reported to decrease need for bowel resection and reduce hospital length of stay and costs. We implemented and studied a delayed enema for intussusception protocol. Our aims were to assess repeat enema success rates and any difference pre- and post-protocol with respect to 1) intussusception recurrence, 2) surgical intervention and complication rates, and 3) length of stay.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective review of treatment and clinical outcomes prior to and following protocol implementation for repeat enema for intussusception at two tertiary pediatric referral hospitals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-protocol period was defined from 2/2013-2/2016, and the post-protocol period from 8/2016-11/2019.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There were 112 patients in the pre-protocol group, with 75 (67%) having successful reduction following the first enema. Of the 37 patients without successful reduction, 15 (41%) patients underwent repeat enema. Of these 15 repeat enema attempts, 4 were successful (27%). The post-protocol group included 107 patients, with 83 (78%) having a successful first reduction. Of the 24 patients that failed, 12 patients (50%) underwent repeat enema, of which 4 (33%) were successful. Compared to pre-protocol patients, post-protocol patients had less surgical interventions and a trend toward more repeat enemas for failed initial attempts. Pre-protocol, 16 patients had recurrent intussusception, with 31% (n=5) having recurrence during the index admission, and 69% (n=11) having recurrence after discharge (within 19 hours to 3 years). Post-protocol, 0 patients had recurrence during the index admission, and 8 patients recurred after discharge (within 2 days to 12 months). Despite less operative interventions, post-protocol patients had higher surgical complications including anastomotic leak, abdominal compartment syndrome and small bowel obstruction, however this increase was not statistically significant. The most frequent operation in both groups was laparoscopic manual reduction, followed by open resection. Average, but not median, length of stay was longer in the post-protocol group, primarily due to patients with bowel necrosis.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Protocol implementation of repeat delayed enemas reduced need for operative intervention, with decreased intussusception recurrence during the index stay and increased initial enema success. We also observed increased complication rates, primarily in patients that underwent open resection.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An IRB-approved single-institution retrospective review of patients&nbsp;with an endoscopic diagnosis of GAW who underwent antral web resection and pyloroplasty (AWRP) from January 2013 &ndash; December 2019 was performed. Primary outcomes extracted were Z-scores and vomiting frequency. Patients were classified as Responders (R- gained weight, vomiting resolved), Partial Responders (PR- gained weight, occasional spit ups) and Non-Responders (NR- no weight gain, continued vomiting).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Forty-four patients (24 male) with median age of 100.4 months (range 1.8-220; 34 patients &lt;60 months) were identified as having undergone AWRP during the study period. Complete data extraction was attained for 40 patients.&nbsp;

Twenty-one patients presented with FTT (Z-score &lt;1.65), with an average presenting Z-score for cohort&nbsp;&nbsp;of -1.75 (range -5.55 to 1.41) .&nbsp;&nbsp;More than two-thirds of patients gained weight 3 months after surgical intervention (67.5%, n=27).&nbsp;

Complete symptom resolution (R) occurred in 42.5% of patients (n=17); 25.0% (n=10) showed weight gain with occasional vomiting reported; 32.5% (n=13) did not gain any significant weight and continued to exhibit emesis postoperatively.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The majority of surgeries (n=32) was conducted by two surgeons who represent our experts in this area, the R+PR =75.0% (n=24) for their collective patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;

On subjective report from primary caregivers, quality of life at the time of surgical follow-up improved in 34 patients&rsquo; families (85.0%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;GAW is an important diagnosis to consider in a child with persistent vomiting and failure to thrive. Outcomes appear dependent on surgeon experience and patient selection. More data is needed to understand which clinical and anatomic features of the disease are amenable to surgical treatment.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: ~~General surgery (GS) procedures from the 2016 ACS NSQIP public use file (600+ hospitals) were grouped according to the first four digits of the primary procedure CPT&reg; code. Groups having at least 100 of both SDGS and EGS cases were included (22 groups; 83,872 cases). HRU patients were defined as those who were in-hospital &gt; 7 days, returned to the OR, were readmitted within 30-days, and/or had major morbidity likely to require an ICU stay. Independent patient and operative NSQIP predictors of HRU were identified through forward regression, p for entry &lt; .05, for exit &gt; .10.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:~~Of GS patients, 33% were HRU (27262/83872). The three highest HRU procedures (enterolysis, total colectomy, and enterectomy) comprised a higher proportion of EGS than SDGS cases (20 versus [v] 5%, p &lt; .001). Secondary procedures with total work RVUs &gt; 10 were more common in EGS (35 v 26%). The duration of operation was lower in EGS by 40 minutes on average after adjustment for procedure group and total primary and secondary procedure work RVUs. All of the remaining 37 independent patient and clinical HRU predictors were higher in EGS cases. These included preoperative SIRS/Sepsis (50 v 2%), ASA classification IV-V (31 v 5%), serum albumin &lt; 3.5 g/dL (40 v 12%), creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dL (28 v 12%), hematocrit &lt; 38% (48 v 35%), and transfer from other facility (26 vs 2%) - all p&rsquo;s &lt; .001. Age &gt; 70 years (35 v 25%) and disseminated cancer (6.3 v 4.8%) were more frequent in EGS cases (p&rsquo;s &lt; .001). After adjustment for 41 NSQIP patient, clinical and operative HRU risk factors, EGS patients remained more likely to be HRU except for readmissions (Table). EGS hospital death was roughly double that of SDGS after adjustment.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:~~EGS patients experience higher death rates and utilize significantly more resources than SDGS patients above what can be adjusted for in the clinically robust NSQIP dataset. Distinctive payment and mortality quality assessment models are necessary for EGS.

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on morbidity and mortality in patients with post-traumatic solid organ injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Retrospective analysis of National Trauma Database Bank&nbsp;during the year of 2015. All adult patients who had solid organ injury; liver, spleen, or kidney injuries were included.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The total number of patients experienced solid organ injury was 39,784. Male patients were predominant. Most of the patients aged between 21 and 30 years old. There were more males than females. DM was a pre-existing comorbidity in 6.9% of the total study population. The mean age of diabetic patients was 58 years, while in non-diabetic patients the mean was 38 years. &nbsp;Diabetic patients showed significantly higher rate of post-trauma complication including acute kidney injury, pneumonia, sepsis, myocardial infarction, stroke, decubitus ulcer, and urinary tract infections.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Enrollment included 16,459 patients, 61% male, median age 53. The majority sustained blunt injury (93%), mean ISS 9. Median BMI 27.6 (range 18.5-94.9), 6,059 (37%) were considered obese, and 241 had a BMI &gt; 50. With increasing BMI came an increased hospital and ICU length of stay (p&lt;0.0001), as well as need for mechanical ventilation and increased length of ventilation (p&lt;0.0001). (Table 1) Increasing BMI was associated with increased chance of discharge to rehab or skilled nursing facility (p&lt;0.001). The presence of any complication was also more prevalent with increasing BMI (p&lt;0.0001), and those requiring CPR (p=0.02).

We hypothesized that patients transferred to these large volume hospitals from other hospitals will have worse outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This retrospective cohort study examined patients admitted to The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center between January 2014 and July 2019 who were diagnosed with sepsis within 48 hours of admission to the surgical ICU. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on mode of admission: transfers from outside hospitals and non-transfers. Demographics and past medical history was obtained at admission to Wexner Medical Center. The primary outcome assessed was 90 day mortality from surgical ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay (LOS), length of surgical ICU stay, days on the ventilator and discharge destination. Results were analyzed using a paired t-test of unequal variances. Significance was defined as &alpha; = 0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Based on our criteria, 1649 patients qualified for our retrospective analysis. 766 patients were identified as patients transferred from an outside hospital and 883 patients were non-transfers. Patients admitted directly to the medical center were more likely to have underlying medical comorbidities, including localized cancers and CKD (Charlson Comorbidity Index 1.49 vs 1.61, p=0.04).&nbsp; Patients transferred in to the hospital had a higher mortality compared to those directly admitted (33.2% vs 21.2%, p&lt;0.001).&nbsp; Hospital LOS was slightly longer in the group directly admitted (25.3 vs 21.3 days, p&lt;0.001). Dependent discharge was also more common in the non-transfer cohort (52% vs 47%, p=0.03).&nbsp; There were no differences in surgical ICU LOS or ventilator days.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Overall, there is a significant increase in mortality in patients with sepsis admitted to surgical ICU that were transferred to Wexner Medical Center compared to those directly admitted. This finding is likely due to a combination of both patient and hospital level characteristics, which require further elucidation. This could be a result of increased complexity in these patients that requires transfer to a larger medical center, further suggesting that earlier treatment of these critically ill patients at high volume centers may improve outcomes. A delay in care that is inherent when a patient is transferred from one location to another, so future projects will evaluate distance traveled during transfer.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: ARDS after mild TBI can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Key risk factors identified include AKI, sepsis, anticoagulant use, DVT, transfusion in first 4 hours, IVF resuscitation in first 4, 8 and 12 hours and intubation upon the admission.

Armen<sup>2</sup>, S. R. Allen<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Penn State University College Of Medicine,Department Of Surgery,Hershey, PA, USA <sup>2</sup>Penn State Hershey Medical Center,Department Of Surgery, Division Of Trauma, Acute Care, And Critical Care Surgery,Hershey, PA, USA <sup>3</sup>Penn State Children's Hospital,Department Of Surgery, Division Of Pediatric Surgery,Hershey, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

The incidence of medical co-morbidities (such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity) is increasing in the general US population.&nbsp; Those with pre-existing co-morbidities present treatment challenges to trauma surgeons after injury, often due to unrecognized or poor control of these conditions. It is unknown how many trauma patients have a primary care provider (PCP) prior to injury and how the pre-injury PCP relationship may affect outcomes after injury. We hypothesized that patients with an established PCP would have decreased hospital length of stay (LOS), fewer ICU days, and decreased in-hospital mortality when compared to a matched population who lack a pre-injury PCP.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

From 2013 to 2019, the trauma registry of a rural Level 1 trauma center was queried for all patients greater than 18 years old (y/o). The presence of a PCP was extracted from each patient&rsquo;s medical record. A case-control analysis based on age, gender, injury severity score (ISS), and mechanism was performed to create a cohort of patients with PCP&rsquo;s and one without PCP&rsquo;s. Differences in hospital LOS, ICU LOS, time on ventilator, and in-hospital mortality were studied. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and significance was defined as p &lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Out of 19,096 patients in the trauma registry, 34.7% had a PCP recorded. From this population, 2,162 patients with PCP&rsquo;s had exact matches to trauma patients without PCP&rsquo;s (n=2,162).Mean age was 54.2 + 21.2 years. 65.2% were male. Mechanism of injury was 96% blunt, 3.7% penetrating, and 0.3% burns. Average ISS was 10.9 +/- 7.6. Mean hospital LOS was longer in trauma patients with PCP&rsquo;s than those without (5.8 +/- 5.7 vs. 4.9 +/- 6.3 days, p &lt;0.01). There was no difference in ICU LOS between the two cohorts (3.0 +/- 3.8 days vs. 3.5 +/- 5.4 days, p = 0.86). Patients with PCP&rsquo;s required significantly less ventilator days than trauma patients without PCP&rsquo;s (1.1 +/- 4.2 vs. 1.7 +/- 4.9 days, p &lt;0.01). In-hospital mortality was lower in the group with a PCP (1.6% vs. 3.6%, p &lt;0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Only 1/3 of trauma patients were noted to have a PCP prior to their injury. Pre-injury primary care was associated with increased length of stay, but fewer ventilator days and decreased mortality. Patients who suffer from known medical co-morbidities may be more likely to have a PCP prior to injury. However, those medical co-morbidities may&nbsp;contribute to longer LOS. Similarly, unknown medical co-morbidities in trauma patients without a PCP may go unrecognized until after their injury. Further prospective study of this&nbsp;relationship is indicated and may allow for improved strategies to promote primary care in populations prone to injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is an IRB approved, four-year multicenter descriptive review of prospectively collected data from January 2016 - January 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;All patients undergoing SSRF were included in the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclusion criteria included those patients &lt; 18 years of age.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic demographics were obtained: age, gender, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviate Injury Scale-chest (AIS-chest), flail chest (yes/no), delayed SSRF &gt; 2 weeks (yes/no) and number of ribs fixated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary outcome was hardware infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary outcomes included mortality rate and hospital length of stay (HLOS).&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic descriptive statistics were utilized for analysis.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 238 patients met criteria for inclusion in the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean age was 58&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;15.2 years and 70% were male.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean ISS was 17.3&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;8.5 with a mean AIS-chest of 3.2&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Flail chest (two consecutive ribs with two or more fractures on each rib) accounted for 32% of patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;26 patients (10.9%) underwent delayed SSRF.&nbsp;&nbsp;The average number of ribs stabilized was 4&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;2.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;When analyzing the primary outcome, only 1 patient (0.4%) developed a hardware infection requiring reoperation to remove the plates.&nbsp;&nbsp;This patient was a delayed SSRF.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero patients in the acute setting developed a hardware infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall HLOS was 10.5&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;6.8 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three patients suffered a mortality (1.3%), all three with ISS scores higher than 15 suggesting significant polytrauma.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This is the largest case series to date examining SSRF hardware infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of SSRF hardware infection is very low (&lt; 0.5%), much less than quoted in current literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in this study, no patient developed hardware infection when the SSRF was completed within two weeks of injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is likely due to advances in the surgical technique through muscle-sparing incisions and minimally invasive SSRF.&nbsp;Overall, SSRF is a safe procedure with low morbidity and mortality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pedestrian injury costs more than $20 billion annually in the Unites States. Among states, Louisiana ranks as one of the worst for pedestrian safety, and the Baton Rouge region was recently ranked nationally as the 19<sup>th</sup> worst metropolitan area for overall pedestrian safety. The aim of the present study was to describe the patient population that presented to our trauma center in order to better understand who is at risk of poor outcome and which areas of the region are the most unsafe.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Adult (18+) patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) from January 2014 - December 2018 were identified in the trauma registry using International Classification of Disease &ndash; Ninth Revision (ICD-9) mechanism of injury code 814.7 and ICD-10 codes V03.10XA and V04.10XA, which indicate automobile vs pedestrian. Accident locations were mapped to the nearest intersection using Tableau 2019.2.9. Poor outcome was defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) &lt; 4, which indicates severe disability, persistent vegetative state, or death.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 317 patients were included. The cohort was primarily male (70.3%), of median [interquartile range (IQR)] age 41 (27 &ndash; 55), and with median (IQR) Injury Severity Score (ISS) 10 (5 &ndash; 17). Median (IQR) length of stay was 7 days (3 &ndash; 13) and ICU stay 5 days (2 &ndash; 10). Most (59.6%) incidents occurred when the sun was down, most common injury was long bone fracture (54.6%) followed by polytrauma (&gt; 1 injury) (41.3%). Median hospital cost per incident was $17,897 ($7,235 &ndash; $41,049). For the 42.3% with an ICU stay, median cost was $33,374 ($12,959 - $63,544). Medicaid/Medicare was the primary payer (51.1%), and 20.2% of patients were uninsured. Forty-one percent (n = 130) patients had GOS &lt;4.&nbsp; Increased age and uninsured status were significantly associated with poor outcome (P = 0.001 and P &lt; 0.015, respectively).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Auto versus pedestrian injuries are an expensive, but preventable, public health problem. Those who are older and/or uninsured are at highest risk for poor outcome. Discrete areas of the Baton Rouge metropolitan area have higher incidence and should be examined from a safety infrastructure perspective in order to reduce morbidity and mortality of pedestrians as well as burden of cost to taxpayers.

Stop the Bleed (STB) was developed to educate the lay public about control hemorrhage techniques in hopes of reducing preventable trauma deaths. Studies have shown this training increases bystanders&rsquo; confidence and willingness to provide aid. However, one high-risk group might be better solicited to take the course: individuals who have been a victim of previous trauma. High rates of recidivism after trauma are well-established, with up to 44% of trauma patients having a history of a previous injury requiring hospitalization. Given this group&rsquo;s risk for recurrent injury, we evaluated their attitudes towards STB concepts.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We surveyed trauma patients admitted to three urban trauma centers in Baltimore from 01/08/2020-03/14-2020. The survey was terminated prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients currently being treated on any inpatient trauma unit were offered to complete the survey via an electronic tablet.&nbsp;The survey contained 12 primary questions, with additional questions depending on the participants&#39; responses. The survey asked about demographics, exposure to life-threatening hemorrhage and first aid training.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
56 patients completed the survey. The majority of respondents had been hospitalized before (93%) and had seen severe bleeding (61%). A majority had never taken a first aid course (61%) nor had they ever heard of STB (84%). Most respondents indicated they would be willing to help someone with severe bleeding form a car crash (95%) or gunshot wound (93%).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Many current trauma inpatients at urban trauma centers may not have heard about the Stop the Bleed course. Focusing STB education on patients at high-risk for trauma recidivism (potentially while an inpatient) may be beneficial to prevent deaths from hemorrhage in trauma recidivists.

Kartiko<sup>1</sup>, S. Kartiko<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>George Washington University School Of Medicine And Health Sciences,Center Of Trauma And Critical Care,Washington, DC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Falls are the leading cause of traumatic injury in older adults. While the risk and severity of falls increase with age, appropriate counseling and physical interventions have been proven to mitigate fall risk. Primary care providers can therefore play a major role in reducing the incidence of falls among their elderly patients. However, primary care providers may be limited by a number of factors including time, resources, and knowledge of risk reduction strategies. This study aims to determine the extent of elderly fall risk screening and counseling that occurs in the primary care setting, and to define limitations to its usage.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A questionnaire was adapted from a previous survey study to explore the beliefs, knowledge, attitudes, and clinical practice regarding falls in primary care providers. Information about participant training background and patient population was also acquired. The questionnaire was distributed by email to 36 primary care providers at a level 1 tertiary urban medical center.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The survey achieved a response rate of 58%. Adults over 65 make up most of the respondents&rsquo; patient population (57%; 25%-86%). All of the respondents agreed that patients over 65 years should be&nbsp; assessed for fall risks. All respondents also agreed that evidence-based fall prevention programs can reduce the risk of falls in older adults who are at high risk; however, 43% of participants did not agree that they had the expertise to perform fall risk assessments. Furthermore, while 52% of respondents were aware of the Medicare reimbursement for fall risk screening, only 24% of respondents have billed for fall risk screening and only 5% of respondents agreed that they were adequately reimbursed for performing fall risk assessments. Lastly, only 57% of respondents agreed with the statement that they had time to perform fall risk assessments in their office.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The results of this survey exhibit that primary care providers are aware that evidence-based fall prevention programs can reduce fall risk and that all older adults should be assessed for fall risk. However, several barriers to performing these risk assessments in primary care clinics were uncovered. These barriers included provider&rsquo;s perception of their lack of expertise to perform fall risk assessments, lack of time, and lack of reimbursement. Notably, a large proportion of survey respondents were not aware that they could be reimbursed for performing fall risk assessments.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified patients who were admitted to a level I trauma center&rsquo;s Trauma/ACS&nbsp;service at least once from January 2017 to April 2020 for possible self-injury.Our institution admitted these patients from a state medical prison.Once included in the study,data was obtained with their entire clinical courses, relevant medical and surgical histories,outcomes,and the initiating risk-factors such as prior self-harm or psychiatric co-morbidities.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We reviewed the records 25 of patients who were able to be identified as having been admitted to Trauma/ACS service or on which they were consulted for possible self-harm.24 patients were found to meet our pre-specified inclusion criteria.&nbsp; These 24 patients resulted in a total of 258 emergency department encounters with 72% of visits directly related to self-harm (n=187.)&nbsp;All records reviewed were male prisoners.The average total number of self-harm admissions for each patient was 7.8 (95% CI, 4.5 - 11.1) with a range from 1 to 31 total admissions.The most common mechanisms of injury included foreign object ingestions (n=77) and self-stabbing (n=69.)In 73% (n=136) of encounters, procedural intervention was required.&nbsp;Exploratory laparotomy was required in 42% (n=10) of patients with a mean of 1.5 laparotomies per patient (95% CI, 0.5 to 2.6) and a range from 0 to 9 total.5 (20.8%)patients developed enterocutaneous fistulas during the course of the study, 100% of these patients had a history of exploratory laparotomy reflecting half of all patients with exploratory laparotomies and none without such a history.With respect to risk factors 21 (87.5%) patients had an established psychiatric history, while 9 (37.5%) had an established substance abuse history.Of patients with an established psychiatric history they had an average 8.6 encounters. Whereas those without an established psychiatric history had an average of 2 encounters (p=0.006).Additionally, those with prior self harm encounters had an average of 9.15 encounters.Those without a prior history of self harm who had an average of 1 encounter (p= 0.0004).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our case series shows marked recidivism in prisoners that practice self-harm.Prior self-harm and mental illness are risk factors for self-harm.Frequently these will escalate requiring major abdominal surgery.Furthermore, with self harm recidivism, those patients that require exploratory laparotomies developed fistulas 50% of the time.Further research is required to better characterize if early intervention in mental health or substance abuse in this population can reduce the self-harming behavior.

Michel-Ruddy<sup>1</sup>, D. Kim<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Harbor-UCLA,Depeartment Of Surgery,Torrance, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common in the elderly and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines recommend a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of &ge;110mmHg to prevent secondary brain injury. Prior research has shown that occult shock (OS), defined as an elevated lactate with normotension, is associated with adverse outcomes. We hypothesized that OS would be associated with increased mortality in elderly patients with TBI.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This is a one-year prospective observational quality improvement study of elderly trauma patients (&ge;65 years) with isolated head trauma who had routine lactate testing upon arrival in the ER. We excluded patients with penetrating injuries or AIS score &ge;3 in more than two body areas other than the head. Patients with OS (SBP &ge;110 and lactate &gt;2.2) were compared to those with normal perfusion (SBP &ge;110 and lactate &le;2.2). The effect of OS was analyzed using bivariate analysis. Our primary outcome was mortality. Secondary endpoints were length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and discharge GCS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;106 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 80 years old, 55% were male, and the median head AIS score was 4. The most common mechanism was a fall (76%) followed by auto vs. pedestrian (17%). There were no differences in mechanism or comorbidities between groups. Overall mortality was 15%. Comparing those with OS to those without (Table 1) there was no difference in discharge GCS or LOS. Patients with OS received significantly more crystalloids in the ER than those without.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;In elderly patients with isolated blunt TBI, we found no differences in mortality, LOS, or discharge GCS between patients with an elevated admission lactate vs. those without. While avoiding hypotension in elderly TBI patients remains vital to avoid secondary injury, the routine use of admission lactate is not supported by the results of this study.

However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the effect that increasing BMI has over the short and especially long term on these patients. We hypothesized that increasing BMI has an initial protective effect, but ultimately ends in worse outcomes. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the effect BMI has on outcomes in trauma patients undergoing exploratory laparotomy.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A Level 1 trauma center registry was queried to include all trauma patients that underwent exploratory laparotomies between June 2015&mdash;April 2020. Demographic factors along with clinical details and outcomes were examined. Baseline characteristics of 3 patient groups defined by BMI categories (i.e., normal-weight, overweight, and obese) and complications were compared. Simple linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between BMI and each complication.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Records of 206 trauma patients who underwent exploratory laparotomies were analyzed. There was no significant difference in demographics or injury severity score (ISS) between groups (Table 1). When each complication was regressed on BMI, significant positive effects were seen for ICU stay, hospital length of stay (LOS) and return to OR. More granularly, a per-unit increase in BMI conferred a log-odds increase of 0.056 in return to OR. These results indicated that BMI had a direct positive association with ICU LOS, hospital LOS and return to OR.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our findings show that with increasing BMI, postoperative complications increase following laparotomy for trauma. As rates of obesity increase, trauma surgeons must be prepared to anticipate plans of care from patient presentation to well beyond discharge to cope with more complex postoperative and post-hospital clinical courses.

Burns is a global public health concern, with the majority of the disease burden affecting low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization estimates that burns account for 180,000 deaths annually worldwide. In settings with limited resources, non-lethal burn injuries lead to severe long-term disabilities due to lack of or delay in accessing treatment. Understanding the epidemiology of burns specifically in East Africa would help the establishment of preventive measures and advocacy for improved access to early treatment.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Studies discussing&nbsp;the epidemiology of burns in East Africa&nbsp;were identified by searching PubMed / Medline (National Library of Medicine), EMBASE (Elsevier), Global Health Database (EBSCO), and Global Index Medicus (www.globalindexmedicus.net) on December 12th, 2019. Controlled vocabulary terms (i.e. MeSH, EMTREE, Global Health thesaurus terms) were included when available and appropriate. The search strategies were designed and executed by a librarian. No language limits or year restrictions were applied.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of&nbsp;1,044 records were retrieved from the database searches, resulting in 897 unique records for screening after duplicates were removed. 87 records were reviewed at the full-text level and 40 articles from 6 countries published between 1993 and 2019 were included in the final review. The study scope was predominantly burns in general (n=16, 40%). Extracted data were sorted into three themes: burn population demographics, burn characteristics and risk factors; and treatment and outcomes. The total number of burn patients recorded was 44369,&nbsp;of which the mean proportion of males was 56%. The most common cause was scalds which accounted for 61% of all burn injuries, followed by open flame (17%). Mortality rate was reported in 16 papers (41%),&nbsp;ranged from 0 to 66.7%.The mean length of stay in hospital&nbsp;ranged from 8.5 to 60 days.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
There is limited and variable data on burn epidemiology in East Africa, especially in adult populations and rural settings, as most existing literature focuses on sub-populations, such as pediatric trauma patients or tertiary hospital settings.&nbsp;More research on the epidemiology of burns is needed to harmonize the data and know the exact burden of burn injuries in East Africa, particularly among adult populations and in rural settings. Scalds and flames being the most common causes suggests that the majority of burns are most of the time preventable household accidents.&nbsp;Future interventions should be targeted at preventing accidents in the home, particularly related to cooking.

A growing number of Crohn&rsquo;s disease(CD) patients are struggling with obesity, paralleling the overall increasing obesity rate in the United States. Bariatric surgery, a direct intervention for weight loss, can address obesity effectively.&nbsp;However, there is a relative lack of large-scale longitudinal&nbsp;assessment&nbsp;for efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery for Crohn&rsquo;s patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This retrospective cohort study used the commercial US Truven Health MarketScan Database from 2011-2017 to identify patients with the bariatric procedure. We categorized bariatric surgery (BAR) into sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and gastric bypass (GB) and analyzed the outcomes between CD&nbsp; patients and those without Crohn&rsquo;s (non-CD) after each type of surgery. We assessed complication rates for dehydration, Clostridium difficile intestinal infection, GI obstruction, other digestive complications after bariatric surgery, acute kidney injury, reintervention, or reoperation. Adjusted OR was calculated from the multivariate logistic regression model to evaluate complications at 30 days and 90 days.&nbsp;For further analysis, 1:4 matching based on age, gender, and comorbidities was conducted to verify the primary result.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 87,792 patients were identified in the SG group (257 CD patients vs. 87,535 non-CD patients) and 73,117 in GB (110 CD patients vs. 73,007 non-CD patients). The mean age of CD patients was 45.61 (&plusmn;10.02) vs. non-CD patients as 43.5(&plusmn;10.64), p&lt;0.05*. CD patients had a higher risk of dehydration (4.28% vs. 1.49%, p&lt;0.00*), infectious complications (2.33% vs. 1.31%, p=0.01*), and acute kidney injury (2.72% vs. 0.84%, p&lt;0.00*) than non-CD patients within 90-days after SG surgery in both primary and secondary analysis. Both CD and non-CD patients had higher complication rates after GB than SG. All-cause readmission rates within 30- and 90- days are higher (p&lt;0.05*) in CD patients than non-CD patients.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Sleeve gastrectomy&nbsp;for Crohn&rsquo;s disease patients showed a relatively safe profile on the overall surgical outcomes since there was not an increased risk of some serious complications such as bleeding or cardiopulmonary events. However, the all-cause readmission rate is still higher among Crohn&rsquo;s disease&nbsp;patients. In conclusion, given the relatively safe surgical outcomes profile, bariatric surgery should still be considered for eligible Crohn&rsquo;s disease patients after an informed discussion of the risks and benefits.

Accurate prediction of patient outcomes after bariatric surgery is desirable for the counseling of patients seeking surgical weight loss.&nbsp; In August of 2019, the American College of Surgeons and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery released the MBSAQIP Bariatric Surgical Risk/Benefit calculator, an online tool that can predict bariatric surgery outcomes based on preoperative patient characteristics. The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy of this Risk/Benefit calculator in predicting our patients&rsquo; outcomes following bariatric surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Patients who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) at our institution between 2012 and 2019 were included in this study. Patient characteristics such as age, sex, BMI, race, functional status, ASA, comorbidities at baseline,&nbsp;30-day reintervention and reoperation rates, weight loss (expressed as difference in BMI, &Delta;BMI), and comorbidity resolution for diabetes mellitus II (DM-II), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 1 year after surgery were retrieved from our prospectively maintained database. Preoperative patient data were entered into the Risk/Benefit calculator and predicted postoperative outcomes recorded for each individual patient. To assess the tools&rsquo; accuracy, we compared actual outcomes of these patients with calculator predicted outcomes using sample t-test.&nbsp; Subgroup analysis based on operation type was also performed. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software, Version 26.0 (SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

During the study period 1455 patients had undergone a primary bariatric operation, of which 789 (54%) had follow up for at least 1 year (312 &ndash; 40% LRYGB and 477 &ndash; 60% LSG). There was no difference between the predicted and actual &Delta;BMI for LSG after one year (p=0.19) and a small difference (&Delta;BMI difference= 0.97) for LRYGB (p&lt;0.001).&nbsp; Comorbidity resolution was overestimated by the calculator for HTN, DM-II, OSA, and HLD ranging from 9%-17% for LSG and 17%-26% for LRYBG (p&lt;0.001 for all).&nbsp; There was no difference in risk estimate for 30- day reoperation or reintervention for LSG but a minor underestimation for LRYGB (1.3%-1.7%, p&lt;0.001)

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The MBSAQIP Bariatric Surgical Risk/Benefit calculator is an accurate predictor of 1-year weight loss and 30-day reoperation and reintervention in our patient sample. Comorbidity resolution, however, appears to be overestimated by the calculator. Bariatric surgeons should incorporate this calculator in the preoperative counseling of their patients and be aware of its limitations.

Edwards<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Mayo Clinic,General Surgery,Jacksonville, FL, USA <sup>2</sup>Temple University,General Surgery,Philadelpha, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been associated with increased weight loss, but more complications when compared to sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery is being increasingly performed in patients with a history of solid organ transplantation with favorable results. However, a direct comparison between RYGB and SG has not been performed in patients with a history of solid organ transplantation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the impact of procedure type on perioperative outcomes in this patient cohort.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients with a history of solid organ transplantation were identified in the 2015-2018 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation Quality Improvement Project Participant Use File (MBSAQIP PUF) databases. Procedure type (SG vs. RYGB) was used to stratify patients. Propensity-score matching and multivariable logistic regressions were utilized to control for inter-group bias. Thirty-day outcomes study cohorts were compared by Mann-U-Whitney and Chi-square tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 678 cases identified, 80% (N=542) underwent a SG and 20% (N=136) had a RYGB. Patients differed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) by multiple demographic variables. After propensity-score matching, 136 patients in each cohort were identified and were similar at baseline (p &gt; 0.05). Patients undergoing RYGB had increased overall morbidity (18% vs. 11%, p = 0.087) and bariatric-related morbidity (14% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.077). In addition, unplanned readmissions (16% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.067) and readmissions related to surgery (13% vs. 6.6%, p = 0.099) were higher in RYGB patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed RYGB to independently increase the risk of overall morbidity (1.90, p = 0.021), bariatric-related morbidity (2.19, p = 0.016), unplanned readmissions (OR 2.41, p = 0.004) and readmissions related to surgery (2.20, p = 0.021) (Table).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients with prior solid organ transplantation undergoing RYGB have increased morbidity and readmissions when compared to SG. Surgeons performing MBS should use caution when recommending RYGB in patients with prior solid organ transplantation.

Gastric cancer (GC) portends a poor prognosis and is more common in Hispanics in the US. Literature has shown racial disparities in presentation, socioeconomic status (SES), prognosis, and care; however, limited information is available on patient factors. In this study, we analyzed the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database (HCUP) to evaluate patient risk factors associated with higher incidence of GC in Hispanics.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted on HCUP database from 2011-2015. Patients were divided into two cohorts: Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites (NHW).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 132,240,840 patients, 144,770 were identified with GC (0.11%).&nbsp; GC (RR=1.34; p&lt;0.001) and H. pylori infection (RR=2.09, p&lt;0.001) were more prevalent in Hispanics. More Hispanic patients had Medicaid or no insurance (p&lt;0.001) and were from lower SES based on median household income (p&lt;0.001). Of the patients with GC, Hispanics presented at much younger age, with most profound differences seen between ages 30-40 (OR=3.17, p&lt;0.001). Although diabetes mellitus (DM) was slightly more common in NHW, it was significantly higher in Hispanics with GC, especially in young patients in both sexes (OR=2.28; ages 40-50), males (OR=2.68; ages 30-40) and most strikingly in younger females (OR=3.26; ages 40-50).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
DM is associated with an increased risk of GC among Hispanic patients, especially in young adults.&nbsp; Although SES and environmental exposures (e.g. H. pylori infection) may play a role in racial disparities, efforts to improve access to healthcare and lifestyle modification may help reduce racial disparities in GC. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Gould<sup>1</sup>, R. Higgins<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Medical College Of Wisconsin,Surgery,Milwaukee, WISCONSIN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Pre-operative hemoglobin (Hb) A1c levels &ge; 8% have been associated with increased post-operative complications in surgical patients. Given the prevalence and physiology of diabetes among bariatric surgery patients, attaining a pre-operative HbA1c &lt; 8% can be a challenge. The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of pre-operative HbA1c on post-operative outcomes in bariatric surgery patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective chart review was conducted on diabetic patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass or gastric banding, at a single institution between the years 2013 and 2019. Diabetic patients were defined as those with a HbA1c &ge; 6.5%. Patients were divided into two groups based on their pre-operative HbA1c levels of &lt; 8% and &ge; 8%. &nbsp;Univariate analyses were performed to determine an association between pre-operative HbA1c levels and post-operative outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 351 primary bariatric surgery patients in the study period, 270 with HbA1c &lt;8%, and 81 with HbA1c &ge;&nbsp;8%. The HbA1c &lt; 8% group had an average pre-operative HbA1c of 6.5% &plusmn; 0.9 compared to 9.0% &plusmn; 1.0 in the HbA1c &ge; 8% group (p&lt;0.001). Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was more frequently performed in the HbA1c &lt; 8% group compared to HbA1c &ge; 8% group (49.3% vs 43.2%), versus the gastric bypass (50.4% vs 53.1%) and gastric banding (0.4% vs 3.7%) (p &lt; 0.04). There was no statistically significant difference in any 30-day post-operative outcome between the two groups, including length of stay, overall complications, intensive care unit admission, hospital readmission, intraoperative complication, reoperation, return to the Emergency Department and mortality (Table 1). There was also no statistically significant difference in 2 week change in body mass index (4.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> &plusmn; 7.3 vs 5.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> &plusmn; 9.7, p=0.20) or 3 month change (8.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> &plusmn; 3.6 vs 7.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> &plusmn; 2.2, p=0.07) between the two groups. Post-operative HbA1c was significantly less in the HbA1c &lt; 8% group both at the 3-6 month (6.0% &plusmn; 0.9 vs 7.4% &plusmn; 1.4, p&lt;0.001) and 6-12 month (6.0% &plusmn; 1.1 vs 7.2% &plusmn; 1.4, p&lt;0.001) post-operative follow-up.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study demonstrated no difference in post-operative outcomes of primary bariatric surgery patients based on a HbA1c cut-off of 8%. This highlights that given the prevalence and physiology of diabetes in bariatric surgery patients, surgery can be considered and safely performed in patients with a pre-operative HbA1c &ge; 8%. Attaining a HbA1c &lt; 8% may not be feasible for some diabetic patients without bariatric surgery.

We previously characterized 8 barriers to bariatric surgery care at the health system level. Our objective&nbsp;was to identify patient and&nbsp;provider perceptions of individual-level barriers to undergoing bariatric surgery within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from the perspectives of Veterans with severe obesity, primary care providers (PCPs), registered dietitians (RDs), health psychologists and bariatric surgeons.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We conducted semi-structured interviews with Veterans with severe obesity and providers, including PCPs, RDs, health psychologists and bariatric surgeons. Veterans were from two Midwest VA medical centers (VAMCs) and had either been referred for bariatric surgery or were participating in the VHA&rsquo;s behavioral weight management program (MOVE!). PCPs, RDs and health psychologists were recruited from three VAMCs in the Midwest region, and bariatric surgeons were recruited from all 21 VA bariatric surgery programs. Participants were asked to describe their experiences with obesity care treatment within VHA. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Four coders developed a codebook, which was applied to all interviews. Conventional content analysis identified individual-level barriers within Anderson&rsquo;s Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, which has two general determinants: individual and contextual (e.g. systems). This analysis focused on the individual determinants, which describe how service utilization is influenced by an individual&rsquo;s need, health behaviors, and predisposing beliefs or social structure.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Thirty-three veterans and 40 providers (15 PCPs, 13 bariatric surgeons, 6 RDs and 6 health psychologists) were interviewed. Nearly three-fourths of Veterans were male, whereas nearly three-fourths of providers were female. We identified six individual-level barriers to undergoing bariatric surgery (Figure 1): lack of social support, fear of surgery and its potential outcomes, fear of change, difficulty adhering to required dietary changes, the perception that weight had not reached its &ldquo;tipping point,&rdquo; and patient characteristics influencing provider referral.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Veterans and providers reported that fears of surgery and concerns regarding adherence to required behavioral and dietary changes were barriers to bariatric surgery. Patient and provider education is needed to address patient fears of surgery and the belief that surgery is a &ldquo;last resort.&rdquo; Furthermore, patients must be empowered to change their personal health practices.

Ehlers<sup>1</sup>, R. Ross<sup>1</sup>, J. Kullgren<sup>1</sup>, A. A. Ghaferi<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Michigan Medicine,Department Of Surgery,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Although bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for obesity, many patients struggle with insufficient weight loss or weight regain following their procedure. Incentive programs directed at patients have become increasingly widespread as a means to influence patient behavior post-operatively. Although evidence suggests great promise in incentive programs influencing short-term outcomes, data on long-term effects are lacking.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using a qualitative study design, we explored the impacts of a pilot study examining the effects of a financial incentive program following bariatric surgery on sustained weight loss and postoperative follow-up. 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted with a reflective demographic of bariatric surgery patients who participated in this program from three medical centers across Michigan. The majority of participants were female (n=21), identified as white (36%) or black (41%), had private insurance (86%), and had an income above $25,000 (69%). Interviews sought to examine how patients perceived the value of the financial incentive program as well as barriers and facilitators to continued weight loss following surgery. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Data indicated that although participants found some value in participating in the financial incentive program, the majority asserted that the compensation did not significantly impact their behavior long-term. Three themes emerged as significant needs to address for bariatric surgery patients working toward sustained weight loss: (1) mental health, (2) dietary support, and (3) social support. As articulately captured by one participant, &ldquo;I think if you take the people that are successful with this, they got their head around their eating, they&#39;re on some sort of a structure, and they&#39;re not allowing outside influences to dictate their life anymore. And I think that&#39;s the biggest key. We can shrink your stomach, we can do all kinds of things medically, but you can still gain weight [after] doing this.&rdquo; It should be noted that individual-level factors such as internal motivations, comorbidities, and demographic characteristics were also found to be influential variables in patient experiences following bariatric surgery.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Although not without value, financial incentives on their own were not found to be a significant motivator for long-term weight loss following bariatric surgery. Data from this study suggest that more long-term support is needed in spaces of mental health, dietary support, and social support following bariatric surgery - with resources being tailored based on individual patient needs.

Chang<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital,Department Of Surgery,Boston, MA, USA <sup>2</sup>Tufts University,Department Of Community Health,Medford, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
In the United States, approximately 80% of bariatric surgery patients are female, while obesity rates between genders are similar. We hypothesize these gender differences in bariatric surgery are influenced by women&rsquo;s empowerment as reflected by gender inequality. This study aims to understand if there is an association between population-level measures of gender inequality&nbsp;and bariatric surgery gender mix.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective analysis of New York&rsquo;s Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) between 2010 and 2015 was performed. Our study included New York State adult patients with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery. Gender inequality was measured with the United Nation&rsquo;s Gender Inequality Index (GII) at the county level and was created with data from the Area Health Resources Files, New York State, American Community Survey, SPARCS, and Centers for Disease Control&#39;s National Center for Health Statistics. Multivariate logistic regression was performed, with the sex of the patient as the dependent variable and adjusting for relevant patient covariates.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
From 2010 to 2015, 71,364 bariatric surgical procedures were performed in New York&rsquo;s 62 counties. Females made up 79.15% of the patient population. In the adjusted analysis, several patient factors were associated with an increased odds of female patient presentation, including Black or African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, older age, and Medicaid insurance. In addition, at the county-level, bariatric surgery patients residing in counties with the highest tercile levels of gender inequality were 11% more likely to be female than male (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.16, p&lt;0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Population gender inequality is associated with the likelihood of women versus men to undergo bariatric surgery. Efforts should be made to increase&nbsp;the empowerment of women thus working towards gender inequality in the community. Furthermore, isolating clinical and societal influences in the bariatric decision-making process may be beneficial in decreasing gender differences in surgery.&nbsp;

Dutton<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Weight management has been suggested as a potential concern resulting from the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Potential weight gain could prove difficult to manage post-COVID. Individuals who are trying to lose weight may consider bariatric surgery, which is indicated for severe obesity and produces greater weight loss compared to standard non-surgical treatments. However, to qualify for surgery, individuals must first attempt to adhere to a diet and exercise program. The present study assessed weight management efforts of individuals with obesity who had been attempting to lose weight for at least 6 months prior to the state-mandated stay-at-home regulations. The study aimed to evaluate whether weight gain occurred during quarantine, and whether any demographic or psychosocial factors may predict weight gain during quarantine.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The study looked at a total of 55 participants (90% female, mean age=49.8, mean BMI 37.4, 38.2% Caucasian) enrolled in a weight loss intervention. Eligibility criteria included a prior diagnosis of obesity (30-50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, avg. 37.4) and prior randomization to the self-directed arm of a weight loss intervention. Participants&nbsp;completed&nbsp;a 6-&nbsp;or 12-month assessment before&nbsp;the&nbsp;lockdown and&nbsp;then&nbsp;completed a COVID-specific ancillary survey&nbsp;1.5-2.5 months after lockdown. The COVID survey collected information on health behaviors, COVID-19 status, weight change, and demographics.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In total during the pandemic, 14.5% of participants reported any weight loss, 27.3% of participants stayed the same, and 58% of participants reported weight gain, with 16.4% of participants gaining more than 10 pounds. Weight change was not associated with marital status, gender, age, race, income, or education (P&gt; 0.05). Loneliness was a strong predictor of weight gain (R<sup>2</sup>=0.266, P&lt; 0.05) and was an important factor during this time.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A majority of patients gained weight during quarantine, which could indicate a potential need for more bariatric surgery post-COVID. Loneliness may be especially predictive of weight gain or unsuccessful weight management during the era of COVID-19. During COVID-19, bariatric surgeons may want to consider loneliness as an important factor for considering sustained adherence to treatment recommendations. Consideration should be made regarding the psychosocial health of patients considering bariatric surgery, with potential interventions to decrease loneliness among those considering weight loss surgery.

The risk factors for conversion during laparoscopic and robotic gastrectomy are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the impact of surgical modality (laparoscopic and robotic) on conversion as well as to identify other risk factors for conversion.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective cohort study included patients with Stage I-III gastric cancer who had a MI gastrectomy from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) between 2010 and 2016. Chi-square and t-tests were used to examine subgroup differences between patients based on surgical approach. Propensity score weighting was used to evaluate factors predictive of conversion. Logistic regression models were used to control for covariates and identify factors associated with robotic and laparoscopic conversion.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The final cohort included 8,305 patients, with 1,246 robotic assisted and 7,104 laparoscopic gastrectomies. The overall conversion rate for MI gastrectomies was 11.6%. Conversion rates were 12.4% for laparoscopic approach and 6.9% for robotic assisted. After propensity score weighting, robotic assisted approach was still significantly associated with lower likelihood of needing conversion compared to laparoscopic&nbsp;approach (OR=0.426, p&lt;0.001). Other factors predictive of conversion included African American race compared to white (OR=1.552 p=0.034), tumor size &gt;5 cm compared to &lt;2 cm (OR=1.580, p=0.028), and total gastrectomy compared to partial gastrectomy (OR=1.360, p=0.039).

Even though venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a rare complication after MBS (0.4%), VTE remains the most common cause of mortality in MBS patients.&nbsp; While there is controversy about the use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in MBS patients, there is increasing consensus that its use is associated with more harm than benefit, including higher rates of DVT, PE and in-hospital mortality. The impact of a pre-existing IVC filter, compared to an IVC filter placed prophylactically in anticipation of MBS remains unclear.&nbsp;The objective of this study is to determine if the timing of IVC filter placement impacts perioperative outcomes in MBS patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;In this observational study, we used the 2015 to 2018 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) databases to identify gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) patients who had an IVC filter at the time of RYGB and SG. Selected RYGB and SG cases were stratified by timing of IVC placement (pre-existing vs. prophylactic). Propensity-score matching (1:1, caliper distance = 0.1) was utilized to estimate probabilities of outcomes. Additionally, logistic regression analyses were performed to determine if IVC filter timing independently predicted mortality or morbidity after MBS. Statistical analyses were performed with StataMP version 16.&nbsp; A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 157,913 RYGB and 393,342 SG cases in the 2015-2018 MBSAQIP databases, 0.8% and 0.7% had an IVC at the time of MBS, respectively. Overall, annual prophylatic IVC filter use decrease in RYGB and SG cases. Propensity matching reduced biases between IVC filter cohorts by 62%-98% and 71%-98% for RYGB and SG cases, respectively. Bariatric-related morbidity was lower in RYGB cases with a prophylactic IVC filter (vs. preexisting) (16.3% vs. 10.6%, RR 0.9, p 0.047). However, overall morbidity (15.6% vs. 10.9%, OR 1.04, p 0.02), 30-day intervention (9.9% vs. 2.5%, OR 1.08, p &lt;0.001) and bariatric-related intervention (4.1% vs. 2.0%, OR 1.03, p 0.001) were higher in SG cases with a prophylactic IVC filter. On logistic regression analyses, timing of IVC filter was not an independent predictor of overall (OR 0.97) or bariatric-related (OR 0.71) morbidity in RYGB cases, but non-Hispanic white race was (OR 1.4). In SG cases, the timing of IVC filter independently correlated with overall and bariatric-related morbidity (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Inferior vena cava filter use as venous thromboembolisms prophylaxis in anticipation of metabolic and bariatric surgery is associated with significantly higher odds of overall and bariatric-related morbidity following sleeve gastrectomy.

Zaidi<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust,Surgery,Sutton, SURREY, United Kingdom","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Malignant gastroduodenal obstruction (GDO) leads to malnutrition and limits quality of life. Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) have gained favour over traditional gastrojejunostomy in the palliation of inoperable malignant GDO. This study aimed to assess the early and midterm outcomes of SEMS in this challenging group of patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent SEMS placement for malignant GDO at a British teaching hospital over a four year period. Data was obtained for the following parameters: Presenting features: age, site of malignancy (e.g. gastric, pancreatic), presence of metastasis or recurrence, initial symptom status. Procedural data: stent type (covered/uncovered), stent insertion route (per-oral or trans-gastric), anaesthetic type (sedation or local anaesthetic to pharynx only), concurrent or subsequent biliary stent insertion. Peri-procedural outcomes: technical success, change in symptom score, mortality (30-day), morbidity (30-day), length of inpatient stay. Late outcomes: mortality (&gt;30 days), re-intervention rate, indications for re-intervention, follow-up duration.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Forty patients with gastric (n=21), pancreatic (n=15) and other (n=4) malignancies underwent SEMS placement. Median age at initial presentation was 72 years (range 42-88 years). Metastatic disease was present in 7/40 (17.5%) patients, recurrent
malignancy in 3/40 (7.5%) patients and metastasis/recurrence in 2/40 (5.0%) patients. Uncovered (n=36) and covered (n=4) SEMS were inserted via an endoscopic (n=25) or transgastric (n=15) approach. Biliary stenting was performed concurrently in 5/40 (12.5%) patients and subsequently in 2/40 (5.0%) patients. Technical and clinical success rates were both 92.5%. Median hospital stay was 5 days (range 1-26 days), with 2 procedurerelated complications (haematemesis and obstructive jaundice) and no procedure-related mortality. Follow-up ranged from 5 weeks to 89 months (median 29 months) and was complete in 35 (87.5%) patients. During follow-up, 2 patients (5%) died; reintervention was required in 6 (15%) patients, for SEMS blockage from tumour ingrowth (n=5) and biliary stent blockage (n=1). Median time from stenting to reintervention was 12.5 (range 8-72)
weeks. The presence of metastasis or recurrent malignancy at presentation showed a significantly higher persistence of symptoms after stenting (Fisher&rsquo;s Exact test p=0.002).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

SEMS are effective in the management of malignant GDO to successfully re-establish enteral intake with minimal morbidity and mortality, and a short hospital stay. Surgical bypass should be preserved for cases in which SEMS placement is not successful or possible. Further research employing greater cohort sizes, including comparative studies, are warranted to further establish the specific indications and benefits of SEMS in the management of malignant GDO.

Ghaferi<sup>1</sup>, J. F. Finks<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan,General Surgery,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Enhanced recovery after surgery is an evidence-based care improvement process with demonstrated improvements in clinical outcomes. There are currently limited data on the effectiveness of enhanced recovery protocols following bariatric surgery. The Finding Useful Techniques to Upgrade Recovery Enhancement (FUTURE) program was designed to develop and implement interventions to bridge this gap. In this study, we sought to describe barriers and facilitators to implementation in a pilot study, with the goal of improving the protocol in advance of future rollout.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We conducted semi-structured interviews with 3 bariatric surgery programs participating in a statewide quality improvement collaborative that had implemented the FUTURE protocol. The interviews were conducted in a focus group format including surgeons, advanced practice practitioners, and program coordinators. The interview guide included questions on every phase of implementation (Development, Pre-implementation, Implementation, and Conclusions). Thematic analysis using NVivo Pro (version 12.6.0.959) was used to analyze the data.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Overall, respondents cited the desire to improve patient outcomes as a key motivation for participation. The main themes to emerge as facilitators included (1) buy-in, (2) staff education, and (3) hospital culture. &nbsp;The main themes to emerge as barriers included (1) site specific challenges, (2) non-compliance of protocol by individual team members, and (3) interruptions to implementation. Participants emphasized the importance of having all team members aligned prior to Implementation as a key element during Pre-implementation. Ensuring buy-in and providing staff education helped achieve this. Having a smaller hospital with fewer team members was thought to create a positive and receptive culture that was beneficial during Implementation. Site-specific challenges, such as availability of specific medications, resulted in modification of the protocol during Pre-Implementation. Individuals who did not comply with the pathway created a barrier during Implementation. Suggested strategies to overcome this included ongoing reminders about the pathway, as well as individualized interventions in cases of disagreement. Interruptions to Implementation were experienced by all sites, either due to job turnover or COVID-19. The data indicated that participants felt positive about their participation in the FUTURE program, particularly regarding patient outcomes.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Participants responded positively to their participation in the FUTURE program. These data highlight the need to consider both cultural and structural factors within programs and hospitals when implementing a multifaceted enhanced recovery program. These key insights are critical to the successful scaling of this intervention to other hospitals seeking to improve the safety, efficiency, and patient experience of bariatric surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sellahewa<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Russells Hall Hospital,Surgery,Dudley, WESTMIDLANDS, United Kingdom","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;

Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication has been the gold standard for the treatment of gastroesophageal disease (GERD).&nbsp;However, other laparoscopic technique such as Toupet, Dor and Lind have also been reported to produce satisfactory clinical outcomes. Laparoscopic Lind procedure described as a 300-degree wrap has been reported to produce satisfactory clinical outcome with much reduced post-operative complication of dysphagia.&nbsp; We aimed to analyse the clinical outcomes of patients who were treated with laparoscopic Lind procedure. The primary outcome was to assess the short term (3months) and long term (24months) symptomatic relief. The secondary outcome measure was to assess the short and long-term development of post-operative complication of dysphagia.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Our prospectively electronic database was retrospectively analysed; the clinical parameters considered included varied presentation of GERD symptoms, preoperative oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), 24 hr manometry, intra operative findings, length of hospital stay, failure rate of procedure, operative complications, patients satisfaction via a standardised telephone conversation and development of long-term complication. All patients underwent laparoscopic non mesh repair of the hiatal hernia with stratafix sutures and preservation of the short gastric vessels.



<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 76 patients underwent laparoscopic Lind procedure of which 47 patients were females (62%) with mean age of 58 SD +/- 15, and a median BMI of 25. Seventy-six patients (97%) had OGD and manometry as part of the pre-operative work.&nbsp; The median DeMeester score and median estimated size of the hiatus hernia (HH) on OGD was 25 and 3cm, respectively. Thirty-seven (49%) of our study population had more than one significant medical comorbidity. Intraoperative complication of bleeding, atrial flutter occurred in three patients (4%).&nbsp; In the initial 3 months follow up, 41% (n=31) experienced dysphagia; 26% ( n-20) gas bloating; 12% (n-9) retrosternal chest pain; 5% (n=4) epigastric pain and one patient developed port site hernia , which was repaired later. Only one patient has persistent GERD symptoms. The median length of hospital stay was 2 SD+/- 3 days. There was no 30 or 90 day mortality and none required redo surgery. At 24 months follow up 93% (n=71) of the patients were completely symptom free without any dysphagia.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Lind procedure is safe and feasible technique which has very low failure rate and with low post-operative complications of dysphagia on long term follow up.&nbsp; We conclude that Lind technique can be safely performed as a day case procedure where proper logistics are in place.

Shabahang<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Geisinger Medical Center,General Surgery,Danville, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Healthcare has made many technological advances over the past several decades. One of the most innovative adaptations of technology into healthcare is the use of virtual technology in clinical care. Telemedicine has the potential to overcome many barriers of access for patients and to increase the ability of physicians and other providers to interact with their patients. The purpose of this study is to better understand how key stakeholders within a busy department of surgery at a tertiary referral center view the integration of telemedicine in clinical practice today.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a qualitative study where semi-structured interviews were conducted with telemedicine stakeholders within a single department of surgery during April-June of 2020. These were then de-identified, and a crystallization/immersion process was used to identify important themes.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of ten interviews were held with telemedicine stakeholders including providers, nurses, and administrative staff. Six major themes emerged including technology, barriers, patient catchment, convenience for both clinical staff and patients, adaptation of novel methods, and patient-provider rapport (Table 1). These themes show that key stakeholders see multiple different concepts as critical to the use of telemedicine in clinical practice today.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Telemedicine provides additional opportunities for practitioners and patients to interact and connect. Stakeholders of telemedicine within a single department of surgery are optimistic about the integration of telemedicine within healthcare today, especially in relation to the potential to increase market share and to make interacting with patients more convenient for all parties. There is some concern about the use of technology, perceived barriers to delivering care using virtual technology, and the effects on patient-provider rapport. Finally, the adaptation of telemedicine has been affected by the current worldwide events of COVID-19 making people more willing to embrace such changes but the long-term adaptation of this technology is yet to be understood.

The number of general surgery residents pursuing dedicated years off of clinical training to complete research is climbing. Residents engaging in research may return to clinical duties with less surgical skill, a phenomenon referred to as &ldquo;skill decay.&rdquo; This study explored the role of laparoscopic simulation curriculum utilized to improve the technical skills and intraoperative performance of research residents. We hypothesized that a condensed, Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS)-based simulation course could reverse technical skill decay in research residents prior to return to clinical duties.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Three laparoscopic FLS-based tested, simulation sessions were administered over a two-week span prior to the start of the clinical, academic year. Participants were residents returning from a two or three year research hiatus in two large, urban academic medical centers of one health system in New York.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Research residents improved in task-specific performance after completion of laparoscopic FLS-based simulation course. Residents performed basic tasks (Tasks 1-3) in a similar time frame, however with less tested errors after simulation training. Residents performed complex tasks (Tasks 4-5) in less time, and with greater accuracy after the simulation course. Confidence scores were greater for all tasks after the simulation course, with greater increase in confidence for more complex tasks. Residents believed that the simulation course had a positive impact on their intraoperative laparoscopic skills after returning to OR. Residents endorsed significant improvement in their confidence on the box trainer and in the operating room. Research residents agreed that the simulation course appropriately trained and tested their laparoscopic skills, was easy to understand, was explained in an appropriate way, was the appropriate length of time, and was useful for returning research residents to reverse potential skill decay.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Basic FLS-based laparoscopic simulation training can be utilized to significantly improve the technical laparoscopic skills, improve laparoscopic skill confidence, and potentially reverse skill decay experienced by research residents returning from gap years. Reasonably short and easy to institute training curricula can be utilized to ease the transition of research residents back to clinical, operative duties.

Suffolk County&rsquo;s (NY) number of cases swelled to as high as 6th nationwide and many of these patients required central venous access for resuscitative efforts. Orchestrated by the Division of Vascular Surgery, a dedicated line service team was created to aid in patient care and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) were chosen as the preferred access method.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  General Surgery residents, traditionally trained in central venous catheter placement, learned to place PICC lines. Once credentialed, these residents assisted in a hospital wide effort for reliable central venous access&nbsp; in critically ill COVID-19 positive patients. The training process included a standardized protocol requiring a comprehensive online didactic PICC line course. After passing the course and attaining the fundamentals of safety and indications of PICCs, residents were trained by credentialed personnel on procedural techniques and supervised during their first two PICC line placements. This allowed for rapid mobilization of trained personnel to assist in line placement, with the added benefit of placing longer, more durable central access devices for supportive critical care.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A recent survey sent to the general surgery residency class showed that 81% of respondents successfully obtained credentialing for PICC line placement. Of those that obtained credentialing, 95% of them did so during their rotations in COVID-19 ICUs and 66% felt that the process of learning the necessary technical skills was of low difficulty. These skill sets were transferred to surgical patients as 52% of residents continued placing PICCs on non-COVID patients who required central access. Table 1 highlights the volume of PICCs placed. Almost 52% of residents confirmed that their decision algorithm has changed since obtaining this training and that future consideration for obtaining central access would include factoring in the added benefits of PICCs versus traditional central venous catheters.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This expansion of traditional surgical training during times of stress on a healthcare system demonstrates the aptitude and commitment of surgical residents to continue to adapt to a changing environment, and to acquire invaluable technical skills for current and future patient care.

To cope with social/physical distancing and other COVID-19 pandemic control precautions, many surgical residency programs (including ours) have adopted a Declared Health Emergency (DHE) rotation to minimize exposure to the COVID-19 without compromising the quality of healthcare or training. We evaluated the experience and educational value of virtual education activities by reviewing the perceptions of the DHE rotation participants through survey questionnaire analysis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The DHE rotation virtual educational activities at our institution included general surgery rounds, trauma rounds, grand rounds, morbidity and mortality sessions, journal club sessions, SCORE sessions, and Disaster and Emergency Preparedness course. Residents, nurse practitioners/physician assistants (NP/PA), and surgeons who participated in the DHE rotation were asked to complete a survey questionnaire describing their perception and experience.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The survey response rate was 100% (faculty-n=13, residents-n=8, NP/PA-n=4). The majority participated in the virtual activities from hospital (n=13, 52%) or home (n=9, 36%) and used a laptop computer (n=15, 60%) or smartphone (n=5, 20%) to participate. The majority reported that virtual activities required minimal technical skills (n=17, 68%) and that the quality of audio-visual connectivity was good/excellent (n=20, 80%). Compared to the traditional in-person conferences before the pandemic, the majority reported that they participated in virtual clinical rounds more often or the same (n=22, 88%), that the overall level and quality of interactions between participants were the same or better (n=19, 76%), that they experienced disinterest/absentmindedness the same or less often (n=21, 84%), and that the knowledge gained during the virtual activities was the same or more (n=22, 88%). All respondents (n=25, 100%) reported that virtual meetings and conferences&#39; educational objectives were met. The majority of the respondents agreed that hospital clinical rounds (n=16, 67%) and grand rounds/M&amp;M (n=22, 88%) should be available in a virtual format when the pandemic is over.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The quality of education and knowledge gain during the virtual educational activities are equivalent to or better than in the traditional face-to-face activities.

Smink<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital,Department Of Surgery,Boston, MA, USA <sup>2</sup>Brigham And Women's Hospital,Center For Surgery And Public Health,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Perceived discrimination, defined as stressful experiences of unfair treatment based on personal attributes, has been linked to adverse health outcomes.&nbsp;It is also well-established that Black, Native American, and Hispanic American residents are less likely to feel that they fit into their training programs, feel less comfortable asking for help, and are acutely aware of the occurrence of unfair treatment in the work environment. We sought to determine the everyday perceived discrimination (a measure of discrimination both in and out of the hospital) among surgery residents.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This study is part of a randomized controlled trial across 8 general surgery residency training programs evaluating the Provider Awareness and Cultural dexterity Toolkit for Surgeons (PACTS), a curriculum designed to improve surgical residents&rsquo; cultural dexterity. Baseline demographic information was collected from residents enrolled at 5 of the sites in the study prior to undergoing any cultural dexterity training. To quantify perceived discrimination, we utilized&nbsp;the nine-item Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS). Response options included never/less than once a year, a few times a year, a few times in a month, at least once a week, and almost every day. The EDS was coded using frequency-based coding. Higher scores represented greater perceived discrimination and these were collapsed into three groups reflecting low (0-12), middle (13-24)&nbsp;or high scores (25-36). Given the distribution of the data, we collapsed the middle and high groups. We then analyzed the data for associations of EDS scores with race, gender, socioeconomic data, and training level using Fischer exact tests and logistic regression models.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We analyzed the self-assessments of 179 residents. Of the resident sample, 51% (n=91) were men. Racial breakdown was 55% (n=98) White, 19% (n=34) Asian, 14% (n=25) Black, and 5% (n=9) Multiracial. 69% (n=98) grew up in zip codes with the highest median household income (MHI) quartile and 75% (n=134) had at least one parent with a master&rsquo;s degree or higher. The median EDS score was 7, with scores ranging from 0-36. Once collapsed, 24% (n=43) fell into the mid/high EDS group. When controlling for other demographic and socioeconomic factors, resident race and MHI were significantly associated with EDS scores. Black residents were 5.8 times more likely to have mid/high EDS scores compared to their white counterparts (p = 0.002, CI 1.90-17.90). Asian residents were noted to be 1.48 times more likely to have higher EDS scores, but this did not reach significance (p = 0.442).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Black surgical residents are more likely to report higher discrimination. With heightened attention to race relations in the U.S. and given the mental and physical health implications of perceived discrimination, it is essential to understand life experiences of surgical residents and ensure that they are given the support they need throughout surgical training.

Most general surgery residency programs (GSRP) have publically viewable information online. Since general surgery is predominantly male[1], we conducted textual analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) to test whether gender-bias exists in written content of GSRP websites.

&nbsp;

[1] https://www.aamc.org/data/workforce/reports/492560/1-3-chart.html

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;GSRPs (n=333) and directors (PD) were identified using the Association for Program Directors in Surgery website; information was cross-referenced with AMA FREIDA and ACGME databases current to January 1, 2020. Numbers of male and female residents, alumni, faculty, and program size were determined from GSRP websites and FREIDA. Webpage URLs (n=3206) were identified from GSRP homepages. Dept. chair and PD welcome messages (n=237; F=40, M=197) were collected. IBM Watson&trade; AI analyzed URLs and welcome message for sentiment, emotion, and tones. Machine learning was not conducted prior to analysis. Qualitative gender-neutrality in welcome messages was determined using a predefined gendered word-bank[1]. Messages were rated as strongly masculine, masculine, neutral, feminine, or strongly feminine. Statistical analyses were performed via IBM SPSS&trade;. Gender differences in outcome measures were tested via an independent t-test.

[1] Gaucher D, Friesen J, Kay AC. Evidence that gendered wording in job advertisements exists and sustains gender inequality. J Pers Soc Psychol. 2011;101(1):109-28.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;AI detected no difference in sentiment or emotion (joy, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness) in GSRP websites directed by male and female PDs or in programs with more male residents, total residents, alumni, or faculty. Programs that had a greater positive sentiment displayed more joy (r<sub>p</sub>=0.542, p&lt;0.01). Joy was weakly positively correlated with GSRPs that had a higher number of F faculty (r<sub>p</sub>=0.18, p&lt;0.01) and total faculty (r<sub>p</sub>=0.18, p&lt;0.01) as listed in&nbsp;FREIDA.

An ANOVA conducted on message gender neutrality showed a significant difference between the number of authors in per neutrality group&nbsp;(F<sub>(4,928)</sub>=5.318, p &lt;0.01). A Scheffe test showed a significant difference in average size between Strongly masculine text and meutral text (p&lt;0.05), and between strongly masculine text and feminine text (p&lt;0.05). Program sentiment was not correlated with welcome message sentiment.&nbsp;No difference was detected in sentiment, tone, or&nbsp;emotion between M and F authors.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Qualitative results from welcome message analysis showed differences in gendered wording. However,&nbsp;an implicit male bias was not detected.&nbsp;We hypothesize AIs weak findings may be due to AI incompatibility or to the absence of machine learning. AI functions depend on predetermined algorithms which can be altered. Machine learning prior to analysis is being conducted for future studies to guide AI and better utilize its capabilities in analyzing bias.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The Chairman&rsquo;s Service is designed to allow chief residents to evaluate patients in their own clinic, schedule operations into their block time, and take responsibility for medical decision making. All aspects of care are properly supervised, but the resident determines the appropriateness of surgical intervention, plans the approach and performs the operation with their own preferred technique instead of practicing according to their attending&rsquo;s preferences. We retrospectively identified patients undergoing inguinal hernia repairs from July 2016 through June 2019 and matched Chariman&rsquo;s service operations to standard service operations 1:1 on CPT, sex and age. We compared patients, recurrence rates, outcomes and complications.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Chief residents performed 78 inguinal hernia repairs (66% open and 34% laparoscopic) on the Chairman&rsquo;s Service during the study period. Age, BMI and ASA were similar between the services, but Chairman&rsquo;s service patients were less likely to be current smokers (1.3% vs 24.7%) and more likely to be past smokers (59.7% vs 26.0%) than standard service patients (p&lt;0.01). Rates of incarcerated (5.2% vs 9.1%), recurrent (10.4% vs 5.2%) and bilateral hernias (19.5% vs 10.4%) were similar between the Chairman&rsquo;s service and standard services, respectively (all p&gt;0.05). Operative times were longer for the Chairman&rsquo;s service for open (123 min vs 67, p&lt;0.01) and laparoscopic (112 min vs 79, p=0.02) repairs. Recurrence rates (6.5% vs 3.9%, p=0.47) and complications including infection, seroma or hematoma requiring evacuation and need for reoperation were similarly low (p&gt;0.05) between the Chairman&rsquo;s and standard services, respectively. Despite low complication rates, Chairman&rsquo;s service patients were more likely to present to the ED post-op (14.3% vs 1.3%; p=0.001), but readmission rates were similarly low (2.6% vs 0%, p=0.09).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Providing general surgery chief residents with a supervised opportunity to direct, plan and provide surgical care in clinic and the operating room, as a transition to what they might experience following graduation, is safe for patients presenting with inguinal hernias.&nbsp;Concerns about patient safety should not be a barrier to maximizing entrustment for the evaluation and operative management of select core general surgery diagnoses and operations.

Although resident wellness is recognized as affecting provider health, engagement, and job satisfaction as well as patient safety and quality of care, the graduate medical education community continues to seek effective interventions to support resident physician wellness.&nbsp; The purpose of this study is to better identify the effect of wellness programs on surgical resident wellness and prevention of burnout.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Qualtrics was used to collect responses to the Resident Wellness and Programming Assessment (RWPA).&nbsp; Data was collected over a two-week period.&nbsp; Participation was limited to a single response from each IP address, preventing collection of multiple responses from the same individual.&nbsp; No identifying information was collected.&nbsp; The final version of the RWPA used in this study consisted of the Brief Resident Wellness Profile (BRWP), the Physician Well-Being Index (PWBI), along with demographic data collection including gender and level of training. The RWPA included a section for respondents to indicate frequency of use of several provided wellness-supporting resources including: housestaff gym, refreshments provided in the resident lounge, same-day medical care on-campus; on-campus social events, off-campus social events, wellness didactic sessions, protected time away from work to attend to personal business (&ldquo;wellness half-days&rdquo;), and employee assistance program.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Analysis for the variable wellness indicated participation in wellness initiatives statistically significantly predicted wellness status, F(8, 22) = 2.424, p=0.048. Further analysis of the effect of individual wellness initiatives on wellness status indicated a statistically significant difference in wellness between residents who participated in off-campus social events, consumed snacks and drinks provided in the resident lounge, and participated in wellness didactics and residents who did not use these resources. No statistically significant difference was noted between participation groups for other wellness initiatives explored.&nbsp; Analysis of the variable burnout indicated participation in wellness initiatives did not statistically significantly predict burnout status.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Although the graduate medical education community recognizes the need for effective wellness promotion and burnout prevention programs for resident physician, little is known about the effects of specific interventions on resident wellness.&nbsp; This study suggests program- or institutionally-provided wellness resources may be effective in promoting housestaff wellness. Provided wellness resources do not appear to have similar effects on burnout in surgical residents.&nbsp;

With advancing postgraduate year (PGY), residents are afforded more operative autonomy, with the goal of being prepared for autonomous practice upon graduation. The effect of resident PGY level on patient outcomes has not been examined in large-scale, multi-institution study. Our objective was to examine the prevalence of association between resident training year and 30-day postoperative complications for four common general surgery procedures in a large national dataset.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) dataset was used to identify adult patients undergoing appendectomies, cholecystectomies, ventral hernia repairs (VHR), and inguinal hernia repairs (IHR) between 2013-2019. The Quality in Training Initiative (QITI), a corollary of NSQIP including trainee-specific information for a subset of participating hospitals, was used to identify cases in which general surgery trainees were involved. The primary outcome of interest was a composite of 30-day postoperative morbidity. The relationship between resident training year and morbidity for each operative type was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for clustering of patients and residents at the hospital level.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In total, 167,719 patients from QITI participating institutions undergoing an appendectomy, cholecystectomy, VHR, or IHR were included. PGY1-5 general surgery resident involvement in each case type ranged from 83.0-92.8%; the remainder of included cases were performed by an attending alone. Raw rates of morbidity varied across&nbsp;operative types: appendectomy 3.3%, cholecystectomy 4.3%, VHR 6.0%, IHR 1.6%. After adjustment for covariates, operative risk, and clustering of patients, resident participation regardless of PGY level conferred no increased risk of morbidity in appendectomies and cholecystectomies when compared to attendings alone. VHR demonstrated increased likelihood of morbidity for PGY3 (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.24-1.84), PGY4 (1.66, 95%CI 1.35-2.05), and PGY5 residents (1.58, 95%CI 1.31-1.91) when compared to attendings alone. IHR showed increased risk of morbidity in PGY4 only (OR 1.46 95%CI 1.04-2.04).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;These results suggest that trainees of all PGY levels can participate in most general surgery procedures without compromising patient outcomes. Increased risk of complications in select procedures may stem from unmeasurable procedural difficulty, variable attending involvement, or increased surveillance of complications as residents advance in surgical skills. Review of such complications should be used as substrate for quality improvement education in surgical training. Further research should examine best educational practices to integrate quality improvement into training in order to best prepare residents for autonomous practice.

Historically, most surgeons have been men, and most nurses have been women. As more women become&nbsp;surgeons, however, the alignment between gender and power shifts, and the potential for new tensions arises. The purpose of this study is to explore how perceptions of gender and power influence cohesion between nurses and surgical trainees.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Six surgical residents, six surgical nurses, and five attending surgeons (both men and women) were given a series of vignettes detailing instances of interprofessional tension. They were asked follow-up questions about the role of gender on motivations and behaviors in these scenarios, to draw from their own experiences, and offer preventive strategies. In-depth interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached; following transcription, responses were analyzed via consensus coding by independent reviewers.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Interviews revealed that some but not all residents perceived that female trainees were questioned more often by nursing staff, and that women were expected to invest more energy building relationships with the nurses than men. Most nurses preferred working with women, or residents of any gender who exhibited stereotypically female behaviors such as relationship building. Nurses expressed frustration with inappropriate behavior (poor communication,&nbsp;angry outbursts) when it was exhibited by residents of any gender, but felt less empowered to confront physicians who they perceived to be out of reach in the hierarchy&mdash;often, that meant men were not directly addressed. These patterns were reinforced when contextual factors (fatigue, acuity of the situation, personal confidence and approachability) were considered (Figure 1). Ultimately, effective communication was more hindered by these contextual variables in female-female interaction than male-female interaction, and trust and rapport were particularly essential for women in facilitating good communication. In most cases, the role of gender in these conflicts was subtle, but,&nbsp;psychologically taxing nonetheless, particularly as reported by women.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

This type of interprofessional tension thrives when the resident and nurse do not know each other well and communication is poor. Particularly for women, building trust and rapport seems to protect against discord and encourage communication rescue. Improving lines of communication between women is, therefore, an indirect but targetable point of intervention that could&nbsp;improve cohesion and ultimately better patient care, whereas for male residents, nurses reported that a more common obstacle was resident approachability. Accordingly, interventions that level the hierarchy and hold men to the same interpersonal standards as women are key.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Understanding how resident participation in surgery affects outcomes is critical for academic surgeons because we must balance resident independence and patient safety. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how resident participation affected outcomes for inguinal hernia repair, the most common general surgery operation in the US. We hypothesized that resident participation in hernia surgery would prolong operative time but have a minimal impact on postoperative complications.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program. We included 61,737 patients &ge; 18 years old who had elective, open, unilateral, inguinal hernia repair from 1998-2018. We used propensity weighting to compare postoperative complications and operative time for patients having surgery performed by an attending alone vs attending with a post-graduate year (PGY) 1, 3 or 5 resident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cohort included 28,806 hernias (48%) repaired by an attending as the primary surgeon. Those cases were compared to 12,024 (19%) with an intern, 9,008 (15%) with a PGY-3, and 10,898 (18%) with a PGY-5 that were performed under attending supervision. Compared to cases performed by an attending alone, there was a slight increase in postoperative complications when residents participated. PGY-1 participation was associated with a 0.13% increase in complications (95% CI -0.11%&nbsp;to 0.38%, p=0.29) while PGY-3 participation &nbsp;was associated with an increase of 0.3%, (95% CI&nbsp;0.01% to 0.59%, p=0.04) and 0.4% for PGY-5&rsquo;s (95% CI 0.69% to 0.11%, p&lt; 0.001). By contrast, resident participation significantly increased operative time compared to cases performed by attendings alone. PGY-1 participation was associated with a 26 minute increase in operative time (95% CI 25 to 27, p&lt;0.001), PGY-3 participation was associated with a 19 minute increase (95% CI 18 to 20, p&lt;0.001), and PGY-5 with a 23 minute increase (95% CI 22 to 24, p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Resident involvement in inguinal hernia surgery was associated with a significant increase in operative time, but had only a minimal impact on postoperative complications. Since resident participation in hernia surgery is safe, surgical programs should focus on enhancing operative efficiency for residents. &nbsp;

Radhakrishnan<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch,Surgery,Galveston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Multiple studies have demonstrated correlation between specific personality characteristics and workplace performance. Other high stress careers, like aviation, have utilized personality testing in applicant selection. Surgical training programs have demonstrated that personality testing may play a role in the identification of high-performing residents. We hypothesized that personality testing may be able to differentiate applicants who successfully matched into a categorical General Surgery position from those who matched into non-categorial positions.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a retrospective review of personality tests and NRMP Match results for all categorical general surgery residency applicants who interviewed at a single institution during the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Match. The Ten-Item Personality Inventory was used to describe the Big Five personality traits of extroversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism, with higher scores correlating to stronger association with that trait. The Grit Scale is a 12-item point scale with the maximum grit equivalent to a score of 5.&nbsp; Applicants who matched into categorical general surgery positions and those who did not match into a categorical general surgery position (non-categorical), were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. A 95% level of confidence was assumed (&alpha;=0.05).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Personality testing results from a total of 375 applicants was evaluated, of which 265 were categorical and 110 were non-categorical. Analysis of the Big Five personality traits revealed that non-categorical applicants scored higher in openness than categorical applicants (p= 0.03). No significant differences were seen between groups in the traits of extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, or neuroticism. However, means for all traits were above the reported national average, possibly indicating a self-selected group of largely homogenous, highly motivated individuals. Although there was no statistically significant difference seen in grit score between the two groups, the comparison that non-categorical applicants had more grit than categorical applicants approached significance (p=0.08).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Of the Big Five personality traits, increased openness was significantly associated with non-categorical match. While increased openness is associated with spontaneity and creativeness, less openness is associated with data-driven pragmatism, which may be considered a more desirable trait in surgical residents. Additionally, a trend toward higher grit was demonstrated in the non-categorical positions, which could be related to previous studies which demonstrated lower grit scores as your career goals became more &ldquo;in reach&rdquo;.

&nbsp;Despite underrepresented minorities (URMs) making up 40% of the population, they comprise less than 7% of all academic surgeons in the United States. The 2020 General Surgery Residency Match demonstrates a variation in the number of URM interns, with &gt;40% of URM interns in some programs, to none at others. This study aimed to identify factors that influence URM applicants&rsquo; decisions in ranking general surgery programs to inform institutions.



<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

An 18-question survey was electronically distributed from June to July 2020 to incoming general surgery residents through targeted social media platforms and emails.

Important themes were identified through a focus group of current URM medical students and PUBMED searches conducted from 2004 to 2020 combining the keywords URM+general surgery+residency. Descriptive statistics and Mann Whitney U tests were performed to determine significant factors.

&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
54 incoming general surgery interns completed the survey with a median age between 25-29, and 67% of whom were females. 31% of participants identified as URM. All participants rated the following factors as being very important in deciding upon their rank list order: 1) anticipated clinical experience 2) perceived morale of residents, 3) post graduate/fellowship opportunities, and 4) the feeling of being wanted at the program. URM general surgery interns were more likely to rate program benefits and finances, revisit opportunities, and post-graduate job opportunities higher than non-URM participants (p&lt;0.05). URM participants also ranked diversity factors, like diversity of residents, diversity of faculty, and diversity and inclusion statements by programs, higher than non-URM participants (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, women were significantly more likely to take into account the political climate at a program and the diversity of faculty and residents of a program (p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

These findings suggest that there is an increased importance of diversity training environment and long-term goals for URM applicants compared to their counterparts. It is important that residency programs consider this as they aim to attract more diverse applicants and create environments that best support their trainees.&nbsp;

Cooper<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>State University Of New York At Buffalo,Buffalo, NY, USA <sup>2</sup>Erie County Medical Center,Buffalo, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Nonsurgical procedures and therapies have become increasingly common in the treatment of hepatic and pancreatic disease. This trend, along with resident work hour restrictions, has the potential to adversely impact general surgical resident operative experience. Previous studies have demonstrated limited resident experience with hepatopancreatobiliary operations, including complex cases specifically. We sought to examine recent trends in operative experiences among graduating surgical residents in liver and pancreatic resections, and to quantify exposure to these operations based on surgical trainee level.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We utilized American College of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) case log reports over an 11-year period from 2008 to 2019. We examined reported total Liver and Pancreas case volumes, and specifically examined the following categories: hepatic lobectomy/segmentectomy, hepatic wedge resection/open biopsy, pancreaticoduodenectomy, and distal pancreatectomy. Cases were recorded as Surgeon Chief (SC) and Surgeon Jr (SJ). This period was divided into three groups (2008-2012, 2012-2016, 2016-2019), and change over time, as well as differences between each category, were analyzed and compared.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Over this 11-year period, the overall number of liver cases increased significantly, from an average of 9.3 to 9.9 (p &lt; 0.01); in contrast, the number of pancreas cases decreased from 11.6 to 10 (p &lt; 0.01). These trends held true when broken down into SC and SJ groups. In each procedure category, there were more SC cases than SJ cases (p &lt; 0.01). The average number of SC cases declined for wedge hepatectomies (1.2 v 0.7, p = 0.01), pancreaticoduodenectomies (4.0 v 3.4, p = 0.03), and distal pancreatectomies (2.1 v 1.7, p &lt; 0.01), whereas SJ cases declined most notably among wedge hepatectomies (1.8 v 1.0, p &lt; 0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Over this time period, resident liver operative experiences increased, whereas pancreas cases declined, all in the context of increasing ACGME case requirements. Although advancements in non-operative management for various hepatic and pancreatic diseases offers significant benefit for patients, reductions in these operations decreases the surgical trainee&rsquo;s exposure to relevant surgical anatomy and their understanding of the perioperative management of such complex cases. The association between these findings and the graduating residents&rsquo; ability to perform such operations autonomously remains unclear. Nevertheless, augmenting the resident experience in uncommon and complex surgical diseases may mitigate any adverse impacts of these trends.

The format was an interactive seminar consisting of lecture, small group discussion, and role-playing educational scenarios. Resident-educators were responsible for content and delivery;&nbsp;the&nbsp;program director and associate program directors served as facilitators only. A pre- and post-workshop survey was designed to evaluate residents&rsquo; confidence in&nbsp;four&nbsp;core topics.&nbsp;Using a&nbsp;5-point Likert scale, residents and interns self-reported confidence in all&nbsp;four&nbsp;categories.&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wilcoxon&nbsp;test&nbsp;was used to compare quantitative data.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 28 residents&nbsp;and interns&nbsp;and 29 interns&nbsp;only&nbsp;attended&nbsp;the&nbsp;in-person and virtual&nbsp;workshops,&nbsp;respectively.&nbsp;Pre- and post-workshop survey response rates were&nbsp;100%&nbsp;and 96%, respectively.

Employee engagement has been shown to be a crucial determinant of success across multiple industries, though its characteristics vary according to the needs and culture of each environment. The components of engagement have not yet been studied in a surgical residency, a formative workplace with arduous demands and dependence on multidisciplinary teams. The purpose of this study is to find out how applicants to a general surgery residency define engagement.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This is a qualitative study where 91 interviews were conducted with applicants to a general surgery residency. During the institution&rsquo;s standard interview process, applicants were asked how they define engagement. Responses were documented by a trained member of the study staff.&nbsp;

Qualitative content analysis was conducted by the research team. Research team members developed initial themes, individually coded the responses, and developed and defined the final themes using an iterative group consensus process.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;

A total of 139 comments about engagement were available from 91 interviews. These responses revealed four themes: teamwork and community, motivation and productivity, common goal, and improvement. Teamwork and community consisted of responses such as &ldquo;people want each other to succeed.&rdquo; Motivation and productivity consisted of responses such as &ldquo;showing up everyday and being willing to give 110%.&rdquo; Common goal consisted of responses such as &ldquo;others are committed to the same mission.&rdquo; Improvement consisted of responses such as &ldquo;Doing your responsibility and bettering the process in some way.&rdquo;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;

Applicants to a general surgery residency define engagement through the lens of collective success and growth rather than personal achievement. In order to increase resident engagement, programs may consider focusing on and promoting collective causes, goals, and achievements.

Our program responded to the knowledge gap of professional development topics by supporting the development of a chief resident capstone course &ndash; a seminar series led by surgical attendings and designed by chief residents.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A novel curriculum consisting of 5 sessions covering professional development topics was designed by our graduating chief residents through a consensus driven review process. The final curriculum represented perceived resident knowledge gaps on these topics. All nine chief residents in our general surgery program were invited to participate in these sessions. Session format was panel discussion led by surgery faculty with time for question and answer. One panel was led by an attorney and a member of our department&rsquo;s business office. The sessions covered academic advancement, job search, transition to fellowship and practice, work-life balance, and contracts and negotiation. Residents were asked to complete a pre- and post-course assessment as well as evaluations for each session.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In our pre-course assessment, 75% of participants stated that they had no or little confidence in the following topics: &nbsp;identifying job opportunities, evaluating the quality of job opportunities, and contract negotiations. Eighty percent of completed evaluations found the sessions very useful (the highest rating). Attendance was excellent: an average of 8 of 9 total residents participated in each session. Narrative feedback from evaluations demonstrated specific appreciation for direct access to attendings&rsquo; candid insights and experiences on topics of professional development. Comparison of our pre- and post-course assessments demonstrated significant improvement in confidence around negotiating contracts, identifying mentors, and identifying research funding (p=0.038, 0.003, and 0.005 respectively).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The introduction of a novel resident driven curriculum to address professional development topics was well received by our graduating chief residents and was met with high session participation and engagement. Our experience demonstrates the importance of trainee &ldquo;buy-in&rdquo; to new curricula and that when possible, planning should directly involve stakeholder residents. To further improve the course, we will be collecting data from our graduates regarding topics of professional interest, as well as assessing those residents who participated for retention of knowledge and educational gaps.

Treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer includes chemotherapy, chemoradiation, and surgery, but patient response to neoadjuvant therapy is variable. Complete response rates to chemoradiotherapy are 15-20%. Patients who have a complete response have improved outcomes. In some studies, surgery is being omitted from treatment for complete responders. There is a critical need to identify mechanisms of resistance to circumvent them. Radiation therapy causes double-strand breaks in DNA leading to cancer cell death if not repaired. DNA-PK is a complex involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. We found that phosphorylated DNA-PK (pDNA-PK) is increased in rectal cancer cells after standard of care treatment. We hypothesized that inhibiting this complex would improve treatment response. Peposertib (M3814) is a DNA-PK inhibitor and was chosen due to its clinical relevance and selectivity.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We assessed the role of DNA-PK in the rectal cancer cell line SW837 and the immune competent CT-26 xenograft model utilizing a standard clonogenic assay, Western blotting, quantification of gamma-H2Ax staining, and measurement of treatment response. The three treatment groups were: standard of care (5-fluorouracil (5FU) (or its oral equivalent, capecitabine) with radiation) versus the DNA-PK inhibitor (Peposertib) with radiation versus Peposertib with 5FU (or capecitabine) and radiation. Peposertib was obtained through the National Cancer Institute, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. We implanted CT-26 cells in the flank of BALB/c mice and treated with drugs or radiation (2Gy per dose) 5 days per week for 2 weeks followed by a 1 week waiting period and tumor harvest. Tumor size was measured 3 times per week. A complete response was defined as no palpable tumor.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;5FU and radiation treatment of rectal cancer cells increased pDNA-PK protein (1.63&plusmn;&nbsp;0.19-fold increase compared to vehicle, p=0.02) and increased H2Ax foci from 29&plusmn;&nbsp;12.8 % to 71.5&plusmn;&nbsp;6.5 % (p=0.056). In a standard clonogenic assay, Peposertib was found to be a potent DNA-PK inhibitor with a radiation enhancement ratio of 1.94. When Peposertib is added to standard of care treatment with 5FU and radiation in rectal cancer cells, the previously seen increase in pDNA-PK is abrogated (1.19-fold increase down from 1.63-fold increase). Balb/c mice with CT26 flank tumors treated with 100 mg/kg capecitabine, 2 Gy of radiation, and 50 mg/kg of Peposertib 5 days per week for 2 weeks showed a 38% complete response rate 1 week after completion of treatment compared with standard of care or other combinations which had no complete responses (N?8 mice per group; p=0.007).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;When the DNA-PK inhibitor, Peposertib, is combined with standard of care treatment, response is improved in rectal cancer models. A clinical trial is ongoing to further explore the role of DNA-PK inhibition in rectal cancer treatment.

Our recent studies have demonstrated the role of gut-microbiome in PDAC progression. Interestingly, smoking also alters the gut-microbiota. Based on this, we hypothesize that smoking promotes PDAC progression via inducing gut-microbial dysbiosis.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;C57BL/6J, Rag1-/- mice (lack adaptive immunity) and CD8 -/- mice were randomized into four arms (controls, cigarette smoke exposure (CSE), antibiotics, and CSE + antibiotics). &nbsp;Pre-exposure was given through smoking chamber for 4 weeks before subcutaneous KPC pancreatic tumor implantation. CSE was continued and tumors followed. In another experiment using KC mice (LSL-Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; Pdx-1-Cre), smoking analogue&nbsp;NNK was used to simulate smoke exposure and four groups were setup as above. Treatment was given for 2 months and animals euthanized. Additionally, smoke-na&iuml;ve WT and Rag 1-/- mice underwent fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from control or smoke-exposed mice with subsequent pancreatic tumor implantation.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;CSE and NNK significantly promoted tumor growth in KPC tumors and KC mice respectively. Depletion of gut-microbiome abrogated these tumor promoting effects. Mice receiving FMT from smoke-exposed mice had higher mean tumor burden than mice receiving FMT from control mice. CSE resulted in an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (decreased CD8, CD4, activated dendritic cells; increased myeloid-derived-suppressor cells) which was reversed by gut microbiome depletion. Compared to WT mice, neither CSE nor FMT from smoke-exposed mice could increase tumors in Rag1-/- mice and CD8 -/- mice, suggesting that tumor promoting smoke-induced dysbiosis requires functional adaptive immunity. Stool analysis showed significant enrichment of genus Clostridium, Akkermansia and Anaeroplasma in smoke-treated mice. Stool metabolomics revealed significant enrichment of guanidine acetic acid, betaine and 4 hydroxy-butyric acid in smoke-exposed mice.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our findings indicate a novel mechanism by which CSE increases PDAC progression through gut-microbial dysbiosis via adaptive immune-system modulation. These findings potentially unveil an untapped avenue for addressing the tumor-permissive effects of smoking by modulating gut-microbiome.

Merchant<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Miami,Surgical Oncology,Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Outcomes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have remained dismal due to resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The emergence of treatment-resistant tumor initiating cells (TICs) has been shown to be a major contributor to these poor outcomes, yet therapies aimed at targeting this subpopulation are lacking. Our recent studies show that interleukin-1&alpha; (IL-1&alpha;) promotes a chemoresistant phenotype in PDAC by sustaining pro-inflammatory signaling cascades within the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of systemic IL-1 inhibition in reducing TIC subpopulations to improve the response to chemotherapy in a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Ptf1a<sup>cre/+</sup>;LSL-Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; Tgfbr2<sup>flox/flox</sup> (PKT) mice were treated with the IL-1 inhibitor, anakinra (recombinant human IL-1 receptor anatgonist, 50 mg/kg BID), or vehicle control for 2.5 weeks prior to sacrifice. Single-cell cDNA library generation was performed using the 10&times; Chromium System. Expression matrices were processed using the R package Seurat 3.0 and clustered using AUC-based scoring algorithm. For survival studies, PKT mice were treated with vehicle, gemcitabine (10 mg/kg), anakinra, or combination therapy until moribund and tissues were further processed for downstream histologic analyses. To recapitulate the PDAC TME in vitro, immortalized PDAC cell lines were co-cultured with pancreatic fibroblasts to validate in vivo findings by qPCR and western blot analysis.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Single-cell analysis revealed that anakinra treatment in PKT mice significantly reduced transcriptional levels of the TIC markers CD133+ (Prom1) and CD44+ (Cd44) within tumor cell subclusters. Furthermore, IL-1 inhibition decreased transcription of the canonical AP-1 signaling genes Fos and Jun downstream in the MAPK signaling cascade, which are critical nodes involved in the maintenance of the TIC phenotype. Combination treatment of anakinra with gemcitabine significantly reduced tumor weight (0.32 g vs 1.03 g, p&lt;0.001) and improved overall survival (59 vs 47 days, p&lt;0.0001) in PKT mice. Histologic analysis&nbsp;revealed a marked reduction in tumor fibrosis, decreased Ki67+ staining, and substantial reduction in the CD133+ TIC population of anakinra-treated tumors. qPCR analysis of tumor cell/fibroblast co-cultures demonstrated that anakinra treatment significantly reduced activation of the p65 NF&kappa;B and p38 MAPK cascades, resulting in a reduction in STAT3 pathway activation and decreased levels of the pluripotency markers Nanog and Prom1.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These findings demonstrate that IL-1 inhibition targets the chemoresistant TIC population to improve the response to gemcitabine in an immunocompetent, preclinical mouse model of PDAC. These data provide compelling translational evidence to explore anakinra in combination with chemotherapy to improve clinical outcomes in PDAC patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;

While MSI and EBV subtypes are known to be immune-enriched and responsive to checkpoint immunotherapy, the immune contextures in CIN and GS subtypes are poorly understood. Using computational immunogenomics, we sought to identify novel immunologic vulnerabilities in GC-CMS.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  TCGA gastric cancer specimens (n=226) were stratified into GC-CMS (CIN,n=112; GS,n=48; MSI,n=44; EBV,n=22). Leukocyte fractions and their association with CMS-specific genomic driver mutations were defined. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) cluster/patch density were stratified by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell proportions. Single cell immune deconvolution examined associations between 11 immune subpopulations and GC-CMS. Two independent gastric cancer datasets (n=202, 375) were used for validation.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Leukocyte fraction, when normalizing for tumor/stromal fraction, was highest in EBV and MSI subtypes. Examining alterations in genomic drivers most strongly associated with relative leukocyte fraction across GC-CMS revealed distinct subtype-specific patterns. Compared with their non-mutated counterparts, mutations in KRAS (CIN/GS), RPL22 (MSI), and CTNNB1 (EBV) were significantly immune excluded (p-adj&lt;0.001), while mutations in CDH1 (CIN/GS), PI3KR2 (MSI), and PTPRD (EBV) were significantly immune enriched (p-adj&lt;0.001). While TIL cluster and patch density were similarly high in EBV and MSI subtypes, relative T-cell compositional analysis revealed a predominant CD8+:CD4+ ratio in EBV, but disproportionate CD4+:CD8+ infiltrate in MSI, tumors. On single cell deconvolution, EBV and MSI tumors were enriched in effector immune contextures-cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, T-helper type-1 CD4+ T-cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. CIN tumors demonstrated a regulatory contexture-regulatory T-cells, neutrophils, and T-helper type-17 cells-while GS tumors were associated with a tolerogenic contexture-M2-like macrophages, T-helper type-2 cells, and T-follicular helper T-cells (Figure). The correlation between these immune contextures and GC-CMS was validated in two independent datasets.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Deconstructing immune contextures in GC-CMS using computational immunogenomics reveals distinct subtype-specific genomic correlates of immune exclusion and enrichment. Tumor-infiltrating immune populations in CIN and GS subtypes differ broadly from those in EBV/MSI tumors. Targeting suppressive immune subsets in CIN and GS tumors, typically resistant to checkpoint immunotherapy, may yield novel therapeutic opportunities.

Downs Canner<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill,Chapel Hill, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the highest immune infiltrate and tumor mutational burden of all breast cancer subtypes however, trials with checkpoint inhibitors (CI) have been modestly successful. Targeting regulatory T-cells (T<sub>regs</sub>), in combination with CI, has therapeutic benefit in cancer. T<sub>regs</sub>&nbsp;demonstrate plasticity and exist on a continuum of suppressive capabilities. Th17 cells have been shown to demonstrate conversion to suppressive T<sub>regs</sub>&nbsp;in colon and ovarian&nbsp;tumor microenvironments.&nbsp;&nbsp;The transcription factor ROR-&gamma;t<sup>&nbsp;</sup>is essential for Th17 cell lineage. We hypothesized that mice deficient in ROR-&gamma;t would demonstrate reduced tumor growth in a murine TNBC model due to altered T<sub>reg</sub>&nbsp;phenotype and/or tumor infiltration.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: E0771 tumors were characterized by whole genome sequencing. 1x10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;E0771 cells were implanted in mammary fat pads of C57/Bl6 (control) and ROR&gamma;t<sup>-/-</sup>&nbsp;mice. Tumor volumes were estimated using calipers. Multicolor flow cytometry and rtPCR was performed from spleen and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes at serial timepoints. Single-cell sequencing of fresh human tumors was performed using the 10X genomics platform to create barcoded cDNA libraries which were then sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The E0771 breast cancer cell line demonstrated a claudin-low (TNBC) gene expression profile. In ROR&gamma;t<sup>-/-</sup>, growth of E0771 tumors was not different than control mice at 3 weeks, but ROR&gamma;t<sup>-/-&nbsp;</sup>mice demonstrated accelerated growth at 2 weeks post-tumor implantation (Fig 1a). There were no differences in percentage of T<sub>regs</sub>&nbsp;in spleens or tumor infiltrate&nbsp;by flow cytometry at 7, 14, and 21 days post-tumor implantation. At 3 weeks, there was a trend toward increased percentage of exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup>) in the ROR&gamma;t<sup>-/-&nbsp;</sup>mice, which corresponded to a point at which growth curves converged (Fig 1b). In the tumors of ROR&gamma;t<sup>-/-&nbsp;</sup>mice, there was significantly reduced expression of checkpoint molecules Ox40 and CTLA4, but not PD-1 (as measured by rtPCR) at 3 weeks post-tumor implantation and reduced expression of CCR8, a marker of T<sub>reg&nbsp;</sub>associated immunosuppression. Spleens of tumor-bearing (but not na&iuml;ve) ROR&gamma;t<sup>-/-&nbsp;</sup>mice demonstrated significantly increased expression of Helios, a marker of T<sub>reg</sub>&nbsp;stability and suppressive capacity. Helios<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>T<sub>regs&nbsp;</sub>were found only in human TNBC tumors and not in hormone-receptor positive tumors.&nbsp;
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:ROR&gamma;t modulates anti-tumor immune response in murine models of TNBC, through altered expression of checkpoint molecules and transcription factors Helios and CCR8. Further studies to understand how ROR&gamma;t impacts response to CI may provide insight into opportunities to develop new adjuncts to existing immunotherapies.

Eliceiri<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Diego,La Jolla, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by malignant tumor cells can remodel the tumor microenvironment, travel through the bloodstream, and modulate the immune response. Thus, analysis of EVs from plasma is emerging as a possible cancer surveillance tool with some advantages over alternative liquid biopsy methods. The aim of this pilot study was to identify possible EV signatures corresponding with metastatic breast cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Under an IRB-approved protocol for the analysis of patient plasma, samples were collected from participants with newly diagnosed or progressive metastatic breast cancer (n=16) and healthy volunteers (n=13). Plasma was processed using serial centrifugation yielding 50-150 nm EVs and analyzed with a bead-based multiplex (Miltenyi Biotec) for the detection of 37 distinct tumor-relevant epitopes and isotype controls. Mean fluorescence of EV epitopes meeting a preset minimum threshold of detectability was compared between the cancer patient and healthy control group using an independent samples&nbsp;t-test. Subgroup analysis was also conducted for metastatic breast cancer patients who were double positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors and negative for HER2 (ER/PR+HER2-, n=8).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In a survey of 37 proteins expressed on EVs, we detected CD105&nbsp;in all plasma samples with a significantly higher mean fluorescence in patients with metastatic breast cancer compared to controls (p=0.04, Figure A). Subgroup analysis with inclusion of only ER/PR+HER2- breast cancer patients compared to controls revealed a similar pattern with higher significance (p=0.01, Figure B).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: We observed that CD105 is significantly increased on breast cancer patient EVs compared to controls. Given that CD105 is known to mediate angiogenesis and promote metastasis, EV-associated CD105 represents a potential biomarker for diagnosis and surveillance&nbsp;as well as a therapeutic target in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Subsequent poor outcomes after trauma are related to both the presence of severe anemia and the need for transfusion. In this study, we hypothesize that the bone marrow transcriptome of blunt trauma patients is altered when compared to elective hip replacement patients and there is a distinct bone marrow response to anemia.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Bone marrow was obtained in a prospective observational cohort study from severely injured blunt trauma patients with a hip or femur fracture (n=52) and compared to the bone marrow of elective hip replacement patients (n=33) and healthy controls (n=8). RNA was isolated from bone marrow using a Purelink RNA mini kit. Direct quantification of gene counts using customized fluorescent probes was performed by NanoString Technologies. Data presented as log2 fold change relative to healthy controls with significance set at *p&lt;0.05.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: When compared to both hip replacement patients and healthy controls, severe blunt trauma led to significant upregulation of genes encoding receptors known to have inhibitory downstream effects on erythropoiesis, including ferroportin, IL-6 receptor, and TGF-&beta; receptor, as well as genes involved in the innate immune system including IL-1b and TLR4-mediated signaling factors (Figure). Trauma patients also demonstrated upregulation in IL-10 transcription which was not seen following hip replacement and has been linked to erythropoietin resistance as well as regulation of the immune response. Whereas, hip replacement patients had downregulation of genes encoding for IL-1b, IL-6, TGF-&beta;, TNF&alpha;, and hepcidin (Figure) and there was no significant change in TLR4-mediated signaling factors.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Differences in the bone marrow transcriptomic response to anemia were identified following severe blunt trauma and elective hip replacement. These differences in the bone marrow transcriptome were related to the innate immune response as well as known inhibitors of erythropoiesis which may explain why blunt trauma patients have a suboptimal erythropoietic response to anemia which persists for months after injury.

Published results from our lab show that when compared to conventional enteral nutrition (CEN), plant-based enteral nutrition (PBEN) significantly decreases intestinal inflammation and preserves beneficial fiber-degrading anaerobes in the gut. We have&nbsp;also shown that&nbsp;germ-free animals on PBEN are&nbsp;not protected from colitis. With these results in mind, we hypothesized that PBEN improves outcomes in colitis via microbiome-mediated effects on macrophage function.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Six groups (n=4 per group) of C57BL/6 male mice were fed either CEN or PBEN for 7 days. On day 8, one&nbsp;CEN and one&nbsp;PBEN group began 4% Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) while one&nbsp;CEN&nbsp;and one&nbsp;PBEN group underwent both DSS and macrophage depletion. Macrophage depletion was achieved by intraperitoneal clodronate injection and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The remaining CEN and PBEN group&nbsp;received clodronate injections without&nbsp;DSS. Weight, stool consistency, and fecal occult blood were tested daily to calculate disease activity index (DAI). A t-test was used to compare mean values. Colonic lamina propria macrophages of animals on PBEN or CEN undergoing DSS and PBEN or CEN without DSS&nbsp;were analyzed with flow cytometery (LSRFortessa and FlowJo software). Surface expression of CD45, Ly6C, MHC-II, CD11b, CX3CR1, and CD11c was used to identify colonic macrophages. These macrophages were subjected to LPS stimulation and IL-10, IL-1, and TNFa were measured. In order to exclude the effects of adaptive immunity, we performed our 4% DSS model on two groups of Rag1 -/- animals (n=4) on either CEN or PBEN.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: PBEN but not CEN protected against colitis in mice lacking B and T cells (Rag1-/- ). However, PBEN did not protect against colitis in macrophage depleted animals (p &lt;0.05). Flow cytometry of animals with intact immune function on DSS showed that when compared with CEN fed mice, PBEN animals had greater populations of anti-inflammatory P4 mature macrophages (CD11b hi, CX3CR1 hi,&nbsp;Ly6C lo, MHC-II+), moderately differentiated P3/P5 population (CD11b hi, CX3CR1 int, Ly6C lo, MHC-II+), and a statistically significant increase in IL-10 production.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our results indicate that PBEN protects against gut inflammation, which is common during critical illness, via effects on both the gut microbiome and intestinal macrophages. It appears that PBEN but not CEN preserves monocyte to macrophage maturation and IL-10 expression in the lamina propria (Figure). Further translational research is required to study the impact of enteral formulas on clinical outcomes in human ICU patients.

Goodman<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Cincinnati,Surgery,Cincinnati, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Propranolol treatment has been shown to improve patient outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Non-traumatic models have shown that propranolol can decrease the accumulation of phosphorylated tau (pTau), a protein implicated in post-TBI encephalopathy. However, the role of propranolol following polytrauma has not been established. We hypothesized that propranolol administration after a combined injury of TBI and hemorrhagic shock would reduce the accumulation of pTau in the hippocampus and its adverse impact the on memory.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Male C57BL6 mice sustained a moderately severe TBI with an established murine weight drop model. Sham TBI mice were anesthetized without head injury. Hemorrhagic shock (HS) was induced immediately post-TBI to a mean arterial pressure of 25mmHg and sustained for 60 minutes. TBI/HS mice were then resuscitated with shed blood to baseline mean arterial pressure. Sham hemorrhage mice were cannulated at the femoral artery but not hemorrhaged. Following resuscitation, mice were administered propranolol 4mg/kg or saline control via intraperitoneal injection. At 30 days post-trauma, mice underwent a four-day Morris water maze training activity. Each mouse had 60 seconds to find the clear platform that was placed in a large water bath. This process was immediately repeated with the mouse being released from a second location in the water bath. Mice were retested on the water maze after a two-day rest. Mouse brains were then harvested for immunofluorescence.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Immunofluorescence demonstrated increased pTau accumulation in the hippocampus of TBI/sham HS mice compared to sham controls. TBI/HS mice demonstrated significantly increased accumulation of pTau compared to TBI/sham HS, as well as non-TBI controls. TBI/HS mice treated with propranolol, however, showed a significant decrease in pTau accumulation (Figure). These results were recapitulated in the behavioral analysis, with sham/sham HS, TBI/sham HS demonstrating significant improvements in their time to platform identification. While TBI/hemorrhage mice did not improve their time to platform, TBI/hemorrhage mice treated with propranolol did (Figure).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The addition of HS to TBI significantly increased the accumulation of pTau in the hippocampus and induced impaired memory performance. Propranolol decreased the accumulation of hippocampal pTau while improving swim test performance. Interestingly, hemorrhage alone was insufficient to produce hippocampal pTau, but showed impaired performance on the swim test, indicating global hypoperfusion of the hippocampus may produce a similar behavioral phenotype as shown in TBI without associated markers of encephalopathy.

Critically ill trauma patients are&nbsp;at increased risk of delayed death due to multiple organ failure (MOF).&nbsp;An intervention that may reduce MOF is controlling stress-induced hyperglycemia (SIH). SIH is a state of elevated blood glucose after injury or illness that is associated with MOF and mortality in critical illness and trauma. SIH is typically attributed to insulin resistance as maintaining euglycemia via exogenous insulin improves outcomes, however, other metabolic derangements in trauma likely contribute to the development of SIH. In particular, glucagon and epinephrine increase in trauma. Normally these hormones increase in fasting or stress to promote hepatic glucose production; and excess glucagon has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia in Type II Diabetes. Both factors activate protein kinase A (PKA) in liver which leads to the phosphorylation of several proteins involved in promoting hepatic glucose production. Thus we hypothesized that PKA signaling is increased in SIH and that inhibition of PKA in liver will prevent SIH.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We used an established mouse model of trauma known as fixed pressure trauma and hemorrhage (TH) to recapitulate SIH and evaluate PKA signaling in a baseline cohort of mice. This protocol includes laparotomy, bilateral&nbsp;placement of femoral artery catheters, and 90 minutes of hemorrhage-induced hypotension monitored via arterial line. Blood and livers were collected before and after 90 minutes hemorrhage (TH0 versus TH90, respectively). PKA signaling in liver was evaluated by Western Blot. The TH protocol was then repeated in mice bearing a liver-specific dominant-negative inhibitory mutant of the regulatory subunit of PKA (L-PKA-DN) so that signaling by PKA was suppressed in liver. GFP-injected littermates served as controls.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Glucose and insulin&nbsp;increased at&nbsp;TH90 following trauma and hemorrhage consistent with SIH (n=11, p&lt;0.0001). As predicted, hepatic PKA signaling increased at TH90 compared to TH0 in this baseline cohort. When hepatic PKA signaling was blocked via the PKA-DN mutation, L-PKA-DN mice had lower glucose levels overall and no longer exhibited SIH (Figure 1, n=6-7, p&lt;0.0001). Namely L-PKA-DN mice average glucose was 95 mg/dL compared to 315 mg/dL in controls. Interestingly, L-PKA-DN mice still exhibited hyperinsulinemia at TH90.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This work demonstrates that PKA signaling is increased following trauma and hemorrhage and significantly contributes to SIH. Given both glucagon and epinephrine signal via PKA, future work will determine their relative contribution to SIH and whether blockade of these hormones, in particular glucagon, can be used in conjunction with insulin to reduce MOF and mortality in trauma via suppression of SIH.

Caldwell<sup>1</sup>, M. D. Goodman<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Cincinnati,Department Of Surgery,Cincinnati, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Early post-injury administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to reduce mortality in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Previous work demonstrated that TXA reduced the numbers of post-traumatic splenic T cell populations after 24h. Currently, the characteristics of immunologic alterations upon 1) leukocyte activation and function, 2) myeloid and T cell numbers with and without TXA treatment following TBI are not well understood. &nbsp;We hypothesized that TXA administration post-TBI modulates the immune response independently of injury itself.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Male C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to a concussive weight drop TBI of moderate severity (400 g weight, 2 cm height, n=5-10 per group). Saline control, 10 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg TXA was administered intraperitoneally 5 min after TBI. Whole blood and spleens were collected at 10 min, 1 h, 6 h, 24h, 7d or 30d after injury. Cell counts were obtained, and leukocytes were characterized using flow cytometry. Activation was assessed using CD11b, ICAM1 for myeloid cells and CD69 for T cells. Blood leukocyte TNF-&alpha; production was assessed by ELISPOT.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;When sham treatment was compared with TBI injured mice, the proportion of circulating neutrophils at 1h increased from 4.0% to 14.8%. Neutrophil and monocyte activation were not significantly changed. Blood leukocyte TNF-&alpha; production was decreased by approximately 2.5-fold at 6h. The administration of TXA after TBI increased neutrophil percentages at 24h from 1.9% to 8.7% but impaired their activation at 1h by decreasing the percentage of ICAM1+ cells from 55.0% to 45.7% and after 30d the MFI of CD11b from 74,638 to 42,139. The TBI injury alone compared with sham mice showed CD4 T cells were only transiently decreased in their activation at 6h as the percentage of CD69+ cells dropped from 62.2% to 47.1%. However, CD4 T cell phenotypes displayed higher percentages of effector type cells after 24h from 5.2% to 10.3% and after 30d from 5.0% to 16.1%. Notably, TXA administration after TBI activated CD4 T cells at 24h by increasing the percentage of CD69+ cells from 40.3% to 51.9% but did not alter the immune response at 30d. Interestingly, none of these differences were observed with higher TXA dose (100mg/kg).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Overall, these results reveal that following an initial neutrophil increase at 1h post TBI, innate immune activation is subsequently depressed. Overall T cell numbers are depressed at 6h after TBI but the effector phenotype remains elevated at 30d post TBI. More importantly, the results demonstrate that TXA in TBI injury accelerates the resolution of the innate immune response, while preventing T cell immune exhaustion. Although more studies are needed, these findings suggest that TBI patients receiving low dose TXA treatment may have a reduced pro-inflammatory response, while maintaining an effective T cell reservoir needed to combat potential subsequent infections.

We have recently demonstrated that pediatric trauma patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) have markedly low A13 levels and increased mortality. To further understand the role of VWF/A13 axis on microvascular beds following trauma, we tested a hypothesis that acute kidney injury (AKI) would be more significant following controlled cortical impact (CCI) in those lacking A13.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Wild-type (WT)&nbsp;and&nbsp;A13<sup>-/-</sup>&nbsp;mice underwent CCI to simulate severe TBI.

In the intensive care setting, source control is a primary defense strategy against unchecked sepsis. However, it can be difficult to discern if adequate source control has been obtained.&nbsp; The innate immune system is exquisitely sensitive to infection. Of the innate cells involved, neutrophils are specifically geared to respond to bacterial infection. It has been demonstrated that uncontrolled sepsis increases the number and function of circulating neutrophils. In contrast, T cell numbers and function are decreased. Here, we utilized two murine models of sepsis, one with and one without proper source control. We hypothesize that leukocyte populations and functions can be used to determine systemic infection and adequate source control.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Male outbred mice underwent 50% cecal ligation with a single 18-gauge puncture. Upon overt signs of sepsis, a subgroup underwent debridement of the necrotic cecum, abdominal cavity lavaged, and intraperitoneal antibiotics administered. At 24 hours, blood leukocytes were collected, enumerated by cell counter, and characterized by flow cytometry. Leukocytes were functionally interrogated for TNFa and IL-2 production by ELISPOT. Phagocytosis was assessed by using pHrodo labeled e. Coli. Blood CFUs were enumerated to confirm both sepsis and adequate source control between groups. One-way ANOVA was used for statistical comparison and p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated significantly decreased numbers of total and na&iuml;ve circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells in septic mice as compared with source-controlled mice (p=0.001). Further, T cells from septic mice demonstrated an approximate 3-fold decrease in IL-2 production after TCR stimulation as compared to healthy and source-controlled mice (p&lt;0.05). Although neutrophil numbers were not significantly different between all groups, neutrophil proportions and their phenotype in whole blood were significantly changed. Phagocytosis was significantly decreased in septic mice as compared to the source control group and untouched controls (p=0.0006). TNFa production was significantly increased in spot size, number, and ratio of change after LPS stimulation for source-control versus septic mice, and was no different than untouched controls. (p=0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Here, we demonstrate that if source control is obtained in a timely manner, systemic immune function returns to that of a healthy subject. These observations may underly an expedient method to clinically determine adequate source control as well in aiding for introducing or terminating antibiotic support in the critically ill patient.&nbsp;

Despite recent national attention on deaths from firearms, little information exists about children and adolescents who are hospitalized with firearm injuries. The objective of the current study was to determine the national frequency of firearm-related hospitalizations in the United States and examined clinical and demographic risk factors associated with readmission in this young population.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The National Readmission Database (NRD) was examined from 2010-2017. Young patients &le;18 years old who survived their index hospitalization with any firearm injury were analyzed. Incidence and annual injury case-fatality rates were estimated. Causes, predictors, and healthcare burden of 30-days readmission were assessed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 35,753 children/adolescents had firearm injury, with&nbsp;86.8% male, and an overall incidence rate of 10.49 (95%CI=9.26-11.71) per 100,000. Across different age groups, 30,549 hospitalizations due to firearm injury (85.4%) were reported in adolescents over 12 years old with incidence rate of 60.51 (95%CI=55.19-65.84) per 100,000 patients,&nbsp;6 times more than the estimates for toddlers and children (10.79; 95% CI=9.46-12.12). In-hospital mortality was reported in 1,948 cases (5.5%). Case-fatality was higher in males (44.4 per 1000, 95% CI: 39.5-49.4) than females (8.5 per 1000, 95%CI=6.3-10.7). Of those discharged alive, 1,616 (5.7%) had unscheduled readmission at 30-days, and nearly half of them (49.3%) were re-hospitalized in the first week. Multivariate analysis showed abdominal firearm injuries (HR=1.13, 95%CI=1.03-1.24,&nbsp;p=0.006) and length of stay less than a week (HR=1.27, 95%CI=1.04-1.55,&nbsp;p=0.016) were associated with higher risk of 30-days readmission. The median length of hospital stay was 7 days (IQR=4-14 days) at primary admission and 4.0 days (IQR=2.0-7.0 days) at readmission. Median total cost of hospital care for firearm-related injuries was $36,535 (IQR=$19,802-$66,443), 22% of which was due to readmissions. Cost associated with 30-days readmissions was $7,978 (IQR=$4,305-$15,202).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Whereas suicide&nbsp;has often been cited as a frequent cause of firearm related death, our findings suggest that assault is a primary contributor to firearm related admissions.&nbsp;Males were disproportionately affected in&nbsp;hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths, suggesting that&nbsp;this population&nbsp;may benefit from targeted&nbsp;preventative interventions.&nbsp;

However, unnecessary exposure to blood products has been associated with a higher risk of&nbsp;complications. We sought to evaluate patient outcomes after early, small volume blood transfusion in the setting of presumed hemorrhagic shock. We hypothesized that over triage with even small amounts of blood would be associated with a higher incidence of complications.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a secondary analysis of the PROPPR trial. Trauma patients&nbsp;who were&nbsp;predicted to require massive transfusion and survived &ge; 72 hours were stratified according to units (U) of packed red blood cells (RBC) transfused: 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-14, 15-19, and &ge;20.&nbsp;Demographic and injury characteristics were compared among groups utilizing a chi-square and ANOVA for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. A Cox proportional hazards model&nbsp;stratified by ISS&nbsp;dichotomized at &lt;16 and &ge;16&nbsp;was used to estimate hazard ratios&nbsp;for the association between RBC transfusion category and adverse events, including&nbsp;acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure (MOF), acute lung injury (ALI), and mortality. Interactions with time were used to assessed the proportionality assumption of the Cox model, and models were adjusted for blunt injury mechanism,&nbsp;and pulse &ge;120bpm at ED admission.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Among 553 included patients, 11.6% (n=64) were transfused 1-3U,&nbsp;23.3% (n=129) 4-6U, 24.6% (n=136) 7-9U, 17.7% (n-98) 10-14U, 8.5% (n=47) 15-19U, and 14.3% (n=79) &ge;20U&nbsp;of RBCs. Patients transfused 1-3U&nbsp;had the lowest mean ISS (p&lt;0.0001). They were less likely to have blunt injury (p=0.0016) or head AIS &ge;3 (p=0.0308), and more likely to have a chest (p=0.0443), abdomen (p=0.0099), or extremity (p&lt;0.0001) AIS &ge;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proportion of patients in each group with an ABC score of&nbsp;&gt;2 ranged from 60-70% (p=0.8). There was a significantly lower incidence of any complication in the 1-3U&nbsp;group (p&lt;.0001): only 1/63 (1.6%) had VAP or ALI and 0 patients developed ARDS or MOF.&nbsp; Compared to patients receiving&nbsp;&gt;10U,&nbsp;those transfused 1-3U were less likely to have sepsis and ALI (p&lt;0.05). Compared to patients transfused &ge;20U, the&nbsp;1-3U group had a lower risk of sepsis,&nbsp;AKI,&nbsp;ALI,&nbsp;and death (all p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;In the absence of highly specific,&nbsp;rapid tools for definitive diagnosis of hemorrhagic shock, early empiric transfusion is often based on clinical judgment and may subject patients to over triage with blood. Among&nbsp;patients meeting current clinical triggers for massive transfusion, receiving 1-3 units of allogeneic blood does not appear to be associated with adverse outcomes.&nbsp;

However, there remains a paucity of data that compares the laparoscopic repair to the open repair approach. Our study aimed to examine patient outcomes after undergoing either of the two different surgical approaches.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Adult (age&nbsp;&ge;18 years) trauma patients presenting with diaphragmatic injury that required surgical repair were identified in the Trauma Quality Improvement Program 2017. Patients were excluded if they underwent any other surgical procedure of the abdomen or chest. Patients were then stratified into two groups based on the surgical approach: laparoscopic repair of the diaphragm vs. open repair. Propensity-score matching in a 1:2 ratio was performed based on patients&rsquo; age, BMI, vital signs at presentation, mechanism of injury, injury severity score (ISS), and diaphragmatic injury side and type. Primary outcome measures were in-hospital major complications (surgical site infections (SSI), sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), acute kidney injury (AKI), and return to the operating room (OR)) and length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 177 adult trauma patients who had a laparoscopic repair of their isolated diaphragmatic injury were matched to 354 patients who had an open repair. Mean age was 36 &plusmn; 15 years, 78% were male, and mean BMI was 28 &plusmn; 7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. 68% of the patients had penetrating injuries with a median ISS of 22 [20-27]. CT imaging was done in 67% of the patients, with 71% presenting with left-sided injury and 21% having visceral herniation. Conversion from laparoscopic to open was reported in 7.2% of the cases. Patients with a laparoscopic repair had significantly lower rates of major complications (5.9 vs. 14.4%; p &lt; 0.001), shorter hospital LOS (6[3-9] vs. 9[5-13] days; p &lt; 0.001) and ICU LOS (3 [2-7] vs. 5[2-10] days; p=0.003).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;180,284 patients met inclusion criteria.&nbsp; The mean age was 69 years &plusmn; 18.5 years with a mortality rate of 4.0%.&nbsp; The AUC for predicting mortality in patients that fall for LR, RF, and XGB were 0.797, 0.876, and 0.880, respectively. &nbsp;The variables which contributed to the prediction in descending order of importance for XGB were respiratory rate, pulse, systolic blood pressure, ethnicity, weight, sex, age, temperature, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) eye, race, GCS voice, GCS motor, and blood alcohol level.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;An extreme gradient boost model developed using state-wide trauma data can accurately predict mortality after fall at a single center within the state.&nbsp; This machine learning model can be implemented by local trauma systems within the state of Pennsylvania to identify patients injured by fall that require greater attention, transfer to a higher level of care, and higher resource allocation.

We have previously demonstrated that elevated plasma Ang-2 levels are associated with coagulation abnormalities in trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock, but the relationship of Ang-2 with fibrinolysis and thrombotic complications after trauma is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of plasma Ang-2 with markers of fibrinolysis and thrombotic events (TE) following trauma-hemorrhage in a secondary analysis of data from the PROPPR trial.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We included data from patients for whom hemostasis was achieved and admission Ang-2 measurements were available. Fibrinolysis was characterized by thromboelastography (TEG) lysis at 30 min (Ly30) and plasma levels of D-Dimer, plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Spearman&rsquo;s correlations were assessed between Ang-2 levels and fibrinolysis at admission and 72h. TE were categorized as occurring within or after 3 days of injury. The predictive characteristics of TEG Ly30, TEG maximum amplitude, D-Dimer and Ang-2 levels for TE occurring within or after 3 days of admission were evaluated using a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve using admission and 72h measures, respectively.&nbsp;P-values&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;0.05 were considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 680 patients enrolled in the PROPPR study, 478 were included for analysis. At admission, Ang-2 correlated with TEG Ly30, D-Dimer, PAP and tPA. Twenty patients had a TE within 3 days of injury, and admission Ang-2 levels were significantly elevated in these patients compared to patients without a TE. Only admission Ang-2 predicted TE occurring within 3 days with an area under the ROC curve of 0.631 (p&nbsp;= 0.048).&nbsp;Thirty-five patients had a TE more than 3 days after injury, and 72h Ang-2 levels were significantly greater in these patients compared to those without a TE.&nbsp;At 72h, Ang-2 levels inversely correlated with TEG Ly30 and correlated with D-Dimer, PAP and tPA levels. Ang-2 and D-Dimer levels at 72h predicted TE occurring after 3 days with an area under the ROC curve of 0.647 (p&nbsp;= 0.007) and 0.627 (p&nbsp;= 0.02), respectively.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Plasma Ang-2 levels correlate with fibrinolytic mediators and fibrin degradation products and predict thrombotic complications after trauma. These findings also suggest that persistent endothelial activation corresponds with a phenotype of patients described by both low TEG Ly30 and ongoing fibrinolysis, which is associated with poor outcomes after trauma. Mechanistic studies are warranted to clarify the role of Ang-2 in mediating coagulation and fibrinolysis abnormalities observed in these patients that may contribute to TE after trauma.

Although recent efforts by surgeons and health systems have sought to improve opioid education for patients, it is unclear what preexisting beliefs patients hold about opioid safety and risk, or how strongly these beliefs influence the patient experience.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We conducted semi-structured interviews with&nbsp;21 patients who underwent one of five elective surgical procedures at our institution. Patients were purposefully sampled to select those with both high and low satisfaction postoperatively using a composite score of satisfaction, regret, and pain from an&nbsp;initial postoperative survey. Patients were asked about their knowledge and beliefs about opioids before surgery, and their perception of postoperative opioid-sparing pathways. Interviews were completed by phone and recordings were transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded iteratively by two coders using MAXQDA.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Four themes emerged regarding patient perceptions about using opioids after surgery (Figure 1). First, there was widespread awareness of the opioid epidemic among the patients: &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to be living under a rock not to know that this is an emergency crisis.&rdquo; Participants largely framed opioid pain medications in negative terms, as &ldquo;terrible, terrible medications&rdquo;&nbsp;associated with addiction, abuse, and overdose. Second, patients had a priori intentions about using opioids after surgery. Some felt their risk of developing opioid dependence was low because of personal characteristics (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have what I consider to be an addictive personality&rdquo;), while others intended to avoid opioids altogether: &ldquo;Before surgery, my wife and I, we decided that I wasn&rsquo;t going to go the opioid route.&rdquo; Third, several participants discussed a personal or familial experience with addiction, which prompted the need to take extra precaution: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an alcoholic, I don&rsquo;t want to get on that stuff. I&#39;ve&nbsp;had surgeries where I absolutely needed it in the past, and it was really hard to get off.&rdquo; Lastly, patients felt that &ldquo;information from other patients is really helpful&rdquo; whereas information provided by the health system may not be useful because it is &ldquo;so filtered and watered down [and] has to go through so many committees.&rdquo;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients undergoing common surgical procedures often arrive at their surgical encounter with strong, pre-formed opinions about opioids. Importantly, education provided by the health system is not felt to be particularly useful to patients. Eliciting these preexisting opinions may help surgeons better counsel patients about safe opioid use after surgery.

Barshes<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Studies have shown that Medicaid coverage among patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with higher rates of primary amputation and worse long-term outcomes. The goal of this analysis was to identify differences and associations with amputation rates&nbsp;among patients with varying health insurance coverage&nbsp;that may explain the outcome disparities.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Publicly available data on Texas hospitalizations from 2008 to 2013 was used to identify patients who underwent treatment for foot complications. Patients were split into four groups by insurance provider: Medicaid only, Medicare only, Medicaid-Medicare dual-enrollment, and commercial insurance. They were then aggregated by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of residence. Multivariate analyses were used to find patient and hospital factors associated with amputation rates. The Gini index was used to quantify the extent of centralization of care among hospitals.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In total, 15,665 patients who underwent treatment for foot complications were included. Among these,&nbsp;1,552 (10%) had Medicaid only, 5,366 (34%) had Medicare only, 5,238 (33%) were dually enrolled, and 3,509 (22%) had commercial insurance. Higher proportions of Medicaid and dually enrolled&nbsp;patients underwent primary amputation than&nbsp;Medicare and commercially insured&nbsp;patients (52%, 50% vs 42%, 40%; p&lt;0.001). Medicaid patients were more likely to present with infection (50% vs 42%,42%,38%; p&lt;0.01) and have longer hospital stays&nbsp;(13.0 days vs 10.3, 9.9, 10.1, p&lt;0.01) than patients in other groups. They were also more likely to&nbsp;live in MSAs with more hospitals&nbsp;(14.1 vs 6.4, 6.5, 8.5; p&lt;0.001)&nbsp;and more providers (19.3 vs 14.9, 14.9, 13.6;&nbsp;p&lt;0.05) per capita. Medicaid patient care was&nbsp;more decentralized among a greater number of hospitals (Gini index&nbsp;0.4 vs 0.58, 0.54, 0.58; p&lt;0.001) and providers (Gini index 0.5 vs 0.69, 0.67, 0.67; p&lt;0.01) than that of the other groups. Amputation rate for Medicaid patients was directly associated with presence of infection (p&lt;0.01), proportion of patients categorized as black (p&lt;0.001), and decentralization of&nbsp;care (p&lt;0.01) (R<sup>2</sup>=0.57). Amputation rate for Medicare patients was directly correlated with hospitals per capita&nbsp;(p&lt;0.001) and presence of gangrene (p&lt;0.001) (R<sup>2</sup>=0.62). Amputation rates for the dually enrolled (R<sup>2</sup>=0.13, p &lt;0.05) and commercially insured (R<sup>2</sup>=0.18, p&lt;0.001) groups were&nbsp;directly associated with proportion of patients categorized as black.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Presenting more frequently with&nbsp;foot infections, living&nbsp;in&nbsp;regions with more providers per capita, and receiving&nbsp;care at&nbsp;larger numbers of low-volume centers rather than fewer high-volume hospitals appears to be contributing to outcome disparities between Medicaid patients and those with other insurance coverage. Racial disparity appears to manifest&nbsp;as increased amputation rates associated with patients categorized as black regardless of insurance type.

Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenting is routine treatment for mesenteric arterial occlusive disease, but is often complicated by in-stent restenosis (ISR). Duplex ultrasound (DUS) velocity criteria have been established for predicting significant stenosis (peak systolic velocity &gt; 275 cm/s) in the native SMA. However, these criteria may overestimate SMA ISR and potentially result in unnecessary reinterventions. This study aims to define DUS criteria for the prediction of SMA ISR using paired DUS and angiographic data.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We performed a retrospective single-center review of patients who underwent SMA stenting from 2016 to 2020. Postoperative CT angiograms (CTA) or traditional angiograms (TA) performed within 3 months of DUS were selected for inclusion. Maximum peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) in the stented SMA were recorded. For each TA and CTA, 2 independent reviewers measured the diameter of maximum stenosis and the reference SMA diameter with electronic calipers to calculate percentage stenosis. For CTA, measurements were obtained in axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. The plane demonstrating maximum stenosis was used for analysis. For TA, measurements were obtained in the lateral view.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There&nbsp;were 48 paired DUS and angiographic studies (22 TA and 26 CTA). PSV and EDV were both higher in patients with &gt;70% angiographic ISR (PSV: 547 cm/s vs. 331 cm/s, p &lt; 0.001; EDV: 155 cm/s vs. 73.3 cm/s, p &lt; 0.001) than those without ISR. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that maximum PSV on DUS was a better predictor of &gt; 70% ISR than EDV (p = 0.047). Optimal DUS criteria for predicting 70% ISR were a maximum PSV of&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;450 cm/s (sensitivity=100%, specificity=97.2%, PPV=92.3%, NPV=100%) or EDV of &ge;&nbsp;80 cm/s (sensitivity=91.7%, specificity=74.3%, PPV=60% NPV=97%). A criterion of combined PSV&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;&nbsp;450 cm/s and EDV&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;&nbsp;80 cm/sec also accurately defined high grade ISR&nbsp;&nbsp;(sensitivity=100%, specificity=89%, PPV=75%, NPV=100%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our study is the first to use of multiplanar CTA in addition to TA to validate DUS criteria for SMA ISR. Results are concordant with the existing literature suggesting that DUS velocity criteria (PSV and EDV) for native SMA stenosis overestimate ISR. We found that the optimal PSV criteria of&nbsp;&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;&nbsp;450 cm/s demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of &gt;70% SMA ISR and combined criteria (PSV&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;450, EDV &ge;&nbsp;&nbsp;80) showed similar accuracy. Ongoing studies seek to identify stent and imaging characteristics associated with false positive DUS findings which are associated with unnecessary confirmatory CTA or TA.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) database was queried for TEVAR performed electively for uncomplicated dissection in years 2014-2018.&nbsp; Patients with undocumented preoperative creatinine were excluded. Renal function was determined by calculating GFR and categorized as normal/mild (CKD 1/2), moderate (CKD 3), and severe (CKD 4/5). Chi-squared, student&rsquo;s t-test, and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to compare baseline demographics and postoperative outcomes by CKD severity as appropriate to the data.&nbsp; Adjusted analyses were performed using hierarchical cox proportional hazards model for the primary endpoint 1-year survival and secondary endpoints using mixed effects modeling.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;There were 712 patients who underwent elective TEVAR for uncomplicated dissection from 2014 to 2018.&nbsp; Normal/mild CKD was present in 79% (n=564), moderate in 18% (n=129), and severe in 3% (n=19).&nbsp; There were no statistically significant differences between groups.&nbsp; Severe CKD was associated with increased total LOS 18.6 vs 10.0 vs 9.2 days (Beta 9.4, 4.9-13.9), increased risk of 30-day mortality 33.3% vs 4.2% vs 5.9% (OR 7.6, 1.7-33.2) and 1-year mortality 57.1% vs 13.2% vs 10.3%(OR 10.3, 2.2-48.9), &nbsp;any complication 47.4% vs 25.6% vs 19.2% (OR 3.6, 1.4-9.0), MI 10.5% vs 0.8% vs 1.4% (OR 7.1, 1.4-36.7), leg ischemia 5.3% vs 1.6% vs 0.2% (OR 24.7, 1.4-427), AKI 55.6% vs 19.4% vs 12.9% (OR 8.3, 3.1-21.7), and new need for dialysis at discharge 16.7% vs 0.8% vs 0.2% (OR 95.3, 9.2-985.1).&nbsp; Severe CKD was a significant risk factor for decreased 1-year survival (Fig. 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This study demonstrates that severe CKD in the context of elective TEVAR for uncomplicated dissection is significantly associated with decreased 1-year survival, and increased healthcare utilization through longer total hospital LOS, major complications, and new dialysis.&nbsp; This study helps quantify the prognosis in this high-risk population informing patient selection and preoperative counseling in thoracic aortic dissection treatment.

PAD typically presents as intermittent claudication (IC), characterized as reproducible muscle pain with ambulation due to reduced lower extremity blood flow. Unfortunately, treatment for IC is limited due to poor compliance with lifestyle modification, limited medication effectiveness, and lack of durable symptomatic improvement with surgical revascularization. We assessed Veterans&rsquo; treatment preferences and willingness to participate in prospective studies that evaluate novel IC treatments.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We administered a 9-item, in-person questionnaire to Veterans with IC at a VA vascular surgery clinic. The questionnaire was approved by experts in vascular surgery and qualitative research and was comprised of open- and closed-ended questions assessing i) IC symptoms, ii) prior and future treatment preferences, and iii) willingness to participate a clinical trial. Open-ended questions were analyzed for recurrent themes, and enrollment continued until thematic saturation was achieved. Responses to open-ended questions were summarized using descriptive statistics. Data from close-ended questions were analyzed with Chi-squared or Kruskal-Wallis testing

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We surveyed 48 Veterans with symptomatic IC (5/2019-12/2019). Of these, 46 (96%) reported bothersome IC symptoms and 30 (63%) reported daily activity limitations (DAL) due to IC symptoms. Ideal treatments were verbalized by 33 patients (69%), including oral medical (N=11 [23%]), topical (N=2 [4%]), physical (N=6 [13%]), and/or surgical (N=10 [21%]) therapies with 4 (8%) explicitly disinterested in a surgical intervention. When directly asked about their interest in medical therapy for IC, 42 (88%) were interested and 27 (56%) were willing to participate in a clinical trial evaluating such therapies. Among patients with DAL (N=30 [63%]), 28 (93%) reported difficulty performing activities of daily living and 5 (17%) noted difficulty with leisure activities. Those with DAL reported a shorter maximal walking distance (median blocks, 0.5 [IQR, 0-1] vs 4 [IQR, 2-5]; P=.001; Figure 1), but had similar verbalization of ideal treatments (N=17 [56%] vs N=14 [43%]; P=.5) and interest in clinical trial participation (N=16 [53%] vs N=14 [47%]; P=.6) when compared to those without DAL.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Veterans with IC report DAL due to IC symptoms, are most interested in medical&nbsp;interventions to improve their symptomatology, and are willing to participate in trials evaluating such therapies. Therfore, this&nbsp;patient-centered study indicates that future research and clinical trials should be directed at finding safe and effective pharmacological therapies to treat IC.

Current guidelines do not address statin therapy in isolated abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in the absence of other atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD). This study aims to describe the long-term mortality effects in AAA patients with and without ACVD who undergo AAA repair.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective review of patients undergoing elective endovascular (EVAR) and open (OAR) in the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative between 2003-2020. Long-term mortality was evaluated based on the presence of statin medications at discharge and stratified by groups with and without concomitant antiplatelet (AP) therapy.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 47,012 cases of AAA repair were identified: 85% EVAR and 15% OAR. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis for all cohorts are shown in Figure 1.

EVAR patients on combined statin/AP therapy had significantly improved survival irrespective of whether they had a known ACVD. Combined statin/AP therapy was protective in Cox Regression analysis for the entire EVAR cohort (HR=.71, p&lt;.001). In the presence of ACVD, patients on statin alone had improved mortality compared to those not on a statin (10.9&plusmn;0.5 vs 10.5&plusmn;0.4 years), but worse in comparison to those on combined statin/AP therapy (10.9&plusmn;0.4 vs 12.2&plusmn;0.2 years). In the absence of ACVD, patients on statin alone had improved mortality compared to patients not on a statin (8.7&plusmn;0.5 vs 8.4&plusmn;0.4 years), but worse in comparison to those on combined statin/AP therapy (8.7&plusmn;0.5 vs 9.4&plusmn;0.2 years).

For OAR, combined statin/AP therapy had a protective effect across all subgroups based on Cox Regression (HR=0.67, p=.046). Based on KM analysis, OAR patients with ACVD on combined statin/AP therapy had significantly improved survival compared to isolated statin therapy (12.6&plusmn;0.5 vs 10&plusmn;1 years) and no medical therapy (12.6&plusmn;0.5 vs 10.7&plusmn;1 years). In KM analysis, OAR patients without known ACVD indications had no significant survival differences based on the presence of statin/AP therapy, but the presence of statin/AP was protective in Cox Regression analysis.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Statin therapy is associated with improved survival in AAA patients regardless of the presence of a known ACVD indication. Although we are unable to assess AAA patients in surveillance prior to repair using SVS VQI data, statin therapy appears to have significant survival benefits even in isolated AAA without ACVD. Addition of this recommendation to current treatment guidelines may be warranted.

We aimed to identify disparities in KT across the country and how these may have changed over time.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Mexico&rsquo;s National Transplant Registry was queried for adult KT performed between 2007 and 2019. Population and gross state income (GSI) per capita were collected from national census data. States were categorized into quartiles (1=low, 2=lower-middle, 3=upper-middle and 4=high) according to GSI per capita. KT rates per million population (KT/pmp) were calculated. A multiple linear regression model was performed to estimate the overall trend in transplant rates over time in each state. An interaction term was used in this model to determine whether transplant rates over time were different amongst GSI quartiles. Non-inferiority tests for independent proportions were performed to assess parity of KT rates between GSI quartiles in 2019.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 29,163 KT were performed. In 2007, KT rate was higher in the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;GSI quartile (14.47 KT/pmp), compared to the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;(11.21 KT/pmp, p=0.001), 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;(12.29 KT/pmp, p=0.045) and 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;(7.54 KT/pmp, p&lt;0.001) GSI quartiles. Since then, KT increased at a rate of 1.06&plusmn;0.15 KT/pmp per year (p&lt;0.001) and rates were&nbsp;2.90&plusmn;0.50 KT/pmp lower for&nbsp;every decrease in GSI quartile (p&lt;0.001). After accounting for the year-GSI quartile interaction, only the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;GSI quartile demonstrated lower rates (&ndash;5.13&plusmn;0.97 KT/pmp*year, p&lt;0.001) compared with the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;GSI quartile (Fig 1A). In 2019, KT rates in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;(30.39 KT/pmp) and 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;(25.67 KT/pmp) GSI quartiles were similar to those observed in the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;GSI quartile (24.70 KT/pmp, both p&lt;0.001 for non-inferiority), but the KT rate in the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;GSI quartile remained lower (15.56 KT/pmp) compared with the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;GSI quartile (p&lt;0.001).

Similarly, the proportion of KT performed by the private sector (Fig 1C) remained stable in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;(28.2% to 33.1%, p=0.144) and 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;(20.0% to 19.8%, p=0.929) GSI quartiles, but decreased in the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;(25.3% to 16.7%, p&lt;0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;KT/pmp rates in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;and 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;GSI quartiles are now on par with the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;GSI quartile. A contributing factor may be that LDKT and KT performed by the private sector remained stable over time in these quartiles while it decreased in the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;GSI quartile. Public health policies in KT should focus on states in the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;GSI quartile, as they continue to have significantly lower transplant rates.

In this study, we examined effectiveness of a novel dressing with add-on component of Continuous Diffusion of Oxygen (CDO) to reduce scar length post cervicotomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed in patients undergoing cervicotomy, either for thyroid or parathyroid disease. Patients were randomized (n=1:1) to either control (CG) or intervention (IG) groups. The IG received a portable oxygen delivery system (TransCu O2&reg;, EO2 Concept, TX, USA), whereas the CG received a standard dressing, for a 4-week period. Primary outcome was scar length&nbsp;reduction objectively assessed with an imaging system (Snapshot NIR, KENT Imaging Inc., Calgary, AB, CAN). General mixed model was used for analysis. The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov-Identifier: NCT03960463.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-one&nbsp;patients were recruited (Age: 53 &plusmn; 16 years; 90% female; CG=9, IG=12). Five patients were lost to follow-up. There were no significant differences between groups for baseline demographics and clinical characteristics. At 4-week, scar length reduction was 40.4% higher&nbsp;in the IG compared to the CG (Cohen&rsquo;s d=1.01, p=0.043, Fig. 1A). In addition, 88.8% of IG achieved more than 10% of scar reduction compared to the CG (28.5%, Fig. 1B).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This is the first study to assess scar reduction with the use of CDO adjunct therapy after cervicotomy. Results suggest that advanced dressing using CDO may improve wound healing post cervicotomy&nbsp;including better outcomes for scar visualization. We speculate that reduced scar in the IG is due to tissue oxygenation and higher tissue moisture in response to CDO, which are known factors to accelerate healing. A larger sample is required to validate this observation.

Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,Pediatric Surgery,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Burnout in surgical residents has been associated with lower quality of life, higher suicidality, and increased medical errors.&nbsp; Moreover, residents who experience discrimination, harassment, or bullying are more likely to report burnout symptoms.&nbsp; However, it is unclear if a program&rsquo;s reputation is associated with the prevalence of these behaviors and the concomitant effects on resident wellness.&nbsp; Our objective was to explore these relationships using Doximity reputation rankings.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Doximity compiles publicly available rankings of U.S. residency programs based on a survey of practicing physicians.&nbsp; Program ranks were obtained from Doximity&rsquo;s website and stratified by quartile.&nbsp; Resident outcomes were obtained from the 2019 post-American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) survey.&nbsp; Mistreatment was defined as reports of sexual harassment, gender discrimination, or racial discrimination.&nbsp; Bullying was assessed using the Short-Negative Act Questionnaire.&nbsp; A modified Maslach Burnout Inventory was used to assess feelings of burnout and personal accomplishment (PA).&nbsp; Additional wellness outcomes included thoughts of attrition and suicidality.&nbsp; All outcomes were modeled with clustered multivariable logistic regression, with adjustment for resident gender, relationship status, race/ethnicity, duty-hour violations, program size, and location.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;6,956 residents (85.6% response rate) from 301 general surgery residency programs responded.&nbsp; Residents in higher ranked programs were more likely to report gender discrimination (top quartile 46.6%, bottom quartile 34.3%, p &lt; 0.001) and sexual harassment (top quartile 46.2%, bottom quartile 36.0%, p = 0.021), although rates of racial discrimination (p = 0.473) and bullying (p = 0.267) were not different.&nbsp; Rates of both burnout (top quartile 48.1%, bottom quartile 33.1%, p &lt; 0.001) and PA (top quartile 91.8%, bottom quartile 83.8%, p &lt; 0.001) were higher at top programs.&nbsp; There were no differences in reported thoughts of attrition or suicidality by Doximity quartile.&nbsp; After adjustment, residents at top quartile programs were significantly more likely to report mistreatment (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.04 - 2.32), burnout (1.46, 1.03 - 2.09), and PA (1.61, 1.01 - 2.57) compared to those at bottom quartile programs (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;General surgery residents training at top-ranked programs report higher PA than those at other programs.&nbsp; However, they were also more likely to report mistreatment and burnout, even after adjustment for other resident and program characteristics.&nbsp; Interventions to address resident burnout should be tailored to the environment and potential risk factors of each program, particularly for programs at risk for mistreatment.

Tuma<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Central Michigan University College Of Medicine,Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: General surgery residency involves performing subspecialty procedures in addition to the core general procedures. However, the proportion of core general surgery versus subspecialty procedures during training is variable.&nbsp; It is unknown whether this proportion is changing due to the increasing number of subspecialty training programs and fellowships. With more residents choosing to pursue subspecialty programs or fellowships, the scope of general surgery training might be altered. Examining the trends in core general surgery and subspecialty procedure distributions during general surgery residency training provides insight for future training planning.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data was collected from the ACGME core general surgery national resident case log&nbsp;reports from 2007 &ndash; 2019. Descriptive and time series analyses were used to compare proportions of procedures performed per average resident in the core general surgery category versus the subspecialty category. Procedures of the individual subspecialties including Vascular, Cardiothoracic, Pediatric, Urology, and Neurology surgery were compared to general surgery. Additionally, F- tests were conducted to determine significance of the slopes of the trend. Descriptive analyses were performed to quantify proportions of procedures performed.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The mean of the total procedures completed by the general surgery resident increased from 910.1 (SD=30.31) in 2007 to 1070.5 (SD=37.59) in 2019 (Figure 1), with annual&nbsp;average increase of 13.37 procedures. The number of General, Cardiothoracic, Plastic, and Urology procedures increased by 24.9% (166.9 procedures a year), 9.8% (3.5 procedures a year), 76.6% (11.1 procedures a year), and 19.3% (1.1 procedures a year), respectively. Conversely, Vascular and Pediatric surgery procedures reported by residents decreased by 7.6% (9.4 procedures a year) and 30.7% (11.1 procedures a year) respectively. The average number of Neurology procedures completed did not change at 1.1 procedures a year. F-tests revealed significant positive correlation in the trend lines for Total (p&lt;0.0001), General (p&lt;0.0001), and Plastic (p&lt;0.0016) procedures and negative correlation in the trend lines for Vascular (p&lt;0.0006) and Pediatric (p&lt;0.0001) procedures.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The trend of procedures completed by a general surgery resident over the last 12 years verifies a steady pattern towards improving operative training opportunity. The increased subspecialty training programs and fellowships did not impact the operative experience of the general surgery programs.&nbsp;Future research to study the quality of operative procedures and outcomes are needed to evaluate the complete effect.

Shabahang<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Geisinger Medical Center,General Surgery,Danville, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The USMLE Step 1 has been used as both a licensing exam and a way for residency programs to evaluate applicants. It has had significant impact upon the match process over time. With the 2020 decision to make the exam pass/fail due to its unclear validity as an evaluation for future physician performance, programs will go through the match without the Step 1 score. We set out to better understand the effects of the exam score on our selection process, with the hypothesis that without the step 1 score, the ranking of our applicants would be significantly altered.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  &nbsp;We performed a retrospective analysis of applications to a single General Surgery residency program with 4 categorial residents per year at a physician led, academic, tertiary care medical center from 2017 to 2020. Important applicant factors including USMLE Step 1 and 2, AOA status, science grades, clerkship scores, audition rotations, volunteer activities, research activities, letters of recommendation, and personal statements were given points and evaluated through our equation, the sum of which was used to create a rank list and offer interviews.&nbsp; The standard deviation of scores was calculated with and without Step 1, and the distribution of scores compared. The range and average of applicants&rsquo; change in point scores were examined.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The applications of 653 students were reviewed. After removal of USMLE step 1 points, 40% of all applicants decreased in rank, 35% remained the same, and 24% increased. Specifically, 18.8% of the top 3<sup>rd</sup> dropped to the middle 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 11.7% of the bottom 3<sup>rd</sup> jumped to the middle 3<sup>rd</sup>, while the middle 3<sup>rd</sup> changed little (0.2% dropped and 0.9% jumped out of middle 3<sup>rd</sup>).&nbsp; The points given for USMLE step 1 created a wider distribution of scores with a negative skewness, suggesting there were more applicants below the mean than above. After removing those points, applicants&rsquo; scores had a narrower distribution and skewness closer to 0, showing fewer upper outliers and more applicants near the mean.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: The USMLE Step 1 score significantly affected the evaluation of applicants, and the removal of it from the recruitment criteria tightened applicant rankings. The elimination of the USMLE Step 1 score in the assessment of applicants will allow for its replacement with variables that better reflect the core values of residency programs.

Genyk<sup>1</sup>, M. E. Sullivan<sup>1</sup>, M. Sheikh<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Southern California,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic in 2020 and has affected millions of lives. Surgical training has also been significantly affected by this pandemic, but the exact effect remains unknown. We sought to perform a national survey of general surgery residents in the United States to assess the effect of COVID-19 on surgical resident training, education, and burnout.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
An anonymous online survey was created and distributed to general surgery residents across the United States. The survey aimed to assess changes to surgical residents&rsquo; clinical schedules, operative volume, and educational curricula as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we sought to assess the impact of COVID-19 on resident burnout.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
1102 general surgery residents completed the survey. Residents reported a significant decline in the number of cases performed during the pandemic. Educational curricula were largely shifted towards online didactics. The majority of residents reported spending more time on educational didactics than before the pandemic. The majority of residents feared contracting COVID-19 or transmitting it to their family during the pandemic.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
COVID-19 has had significant impact on surgical training and education. One positive consequence of the pandemic is increased educational didactics. Online didactics should continue to be a part of surgical education in the post-COVID-19 era. Steps need to be taken to ensure that graduating surgical residents are adequately prepared for fellowship and independent practice despite the significantly decreased case volumes during this pandemic. Surgery training programs should focus on providing non-technical clinical training and professional development during this time.

Stirling<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Griffith University,School Of Medicine,Gold Coast, QLD, Australia <sup>2</sup>Bond University,Faculty Of Health Sciences And Medicine,Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
A growing body of international literature has shown that surgical interest amongst medical students has been steadily declining. Our objective was to assess the pre- and post-rotation understanding, knowledge and interest in surgery for a cohort of medical students and to evaluate how exposure to factors during their general surgery clerkship impacted on their surgical interest.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A survey was sent to penultimate and final year medical students from two South-East Queensland institutions who had completed at least 4 weeks in a general surgery clerkship. Survey items were expressed on 5-point Likert scales and assessed prior exposure to general surgery, pre- and post-rotation understanding, knowledge and interest in surgery. Exposure to factors experienced within the rotation were measured with 10 items, as was the perceived impact. Differences and relationships between pre- and post-rotation variables were tested with paired t-test and Spearman rank correlation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out to assess the effect of variables on interest in a surgical career.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The response rate was 50.9% (160/314). There were statistically significant increases in self-ratings of surgical knowledge and skills (p&lt;0.001) before and after the rotation, however there were no differences in interest in a surgical career (p=0.069). All correlations were positive between knowledge and skills in surgery and understanding and interest in a surgical career. There were statistically significant associations between gender and pre-rotation interest in surgery (,p&lt;0.001), with female students being 56% less likely than male students in showing post-rotation interest (OR: 0.44,p=0.017). There was a large positive correlation between exposure to factors in the surgical clerkship and perceived impact (r<sub>s</sub>=0.77,p&lt;0.001).&nbsp;Univariate logistic regression showed that having &lsquo;surgeons as role models&rsquo;, (OR:3.35,p=0.001), &lsquo;scrubbing and assisting in theatre&rsquo; (OR:2.58,p=0.013) and &lsquo;research opportunities&rsquo; OR:2.57,p=0.033) were the most influential rotation factors for increased interests in a surgical career. Multivariate logistic regression showed a high pre-rotation interest (OR: 7.35,p&lt;0.001) and self-rating of post-rotation knowledge and skills (OR: 4.76,p=0.001) were significant external factors for higher interest in a surgical career.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our study shows that a surgical clerkship can have a large impact on the career interests of medical students. External factors such as gender, lifestyle and personality traits can also play a role in surgical interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Educators can better promote the field of surgery by focussing on the factors that inspire early surgical interest amongst medical students. More studies are required to evaluate the quality, experience and impact of surgical education and surgical clerkships on medical students across different institutions.

Davydova<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Minnesota,Department Of Surgery,Minneapolis, MN, USA <sup>2</sup>Mayo Clinic,Rochester, MN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Oncolytic viruses represent an emerging class of cancer therapeutics which have the ability to selectively replicate in cancer cells and express select transgenes at the local tumor site.&nbsp; The Sodium Iodide Symporter (NIS) transgene can be inserted into the adenovirus genome to facilitate both anti-cancer therapy with radioactive iodine as well as real-time imaging to monitor viral replication and treatment effects.&nbsp; One of the limitations to successful radioiodine-based therapy is the ability to minimize the efflux of iodine from the tumor cells; therefore, optimized regimens are needed to achieve the full potential of this therapy for extra-thyroidal malignancies.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Our research group has designed an infectivity-enhanced, selectively-replicating oncolytic adenovirus that expresses the NIS transgene from the E3 region of the adenovirus genome (OAd5/3-NIS).&nbsp; The NIS-expressing viruses were tested in multiple in vivo models including a murine model with patient-derived pancreatic cancer xenografts (PDX) as well as in a murine lung cancer model to test the combination with radioactive iodine.&nbsp; The adenoviruses were delivered via an intratumoral injection at a dose of 4x10<sup>10</sup> viral particles/tumor.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In the pancreatic cancer PDX model, a single intratumoral dose of the NIS-expressing adenovirus facilitated SPECT/CT imaging (using a technetium radiotracer, <sup>99m</sup>Tc) with the signal persisting for over four weeks following viral injection.&nbsp; The OAd5/3-NIS treatment group demonstrated significant tumor regression compared to control groups and histologic sections of treated tumors at day 28 demonstrated staining for NIS.&nbsp; When combined with the OAd5/3-NIS in a murine lung cancer model, radioactive iodine ( <sup>131</sup>I, single intraperitoneal dose of 3.0 mCi) improved the overall therapeutic effect.&nbsp; The combination therapy group provided significant tumor regression compared to monotherapy and saline control groups.&nbsp; Interestingly, by day 18 following viral injection there was no evidence of continued radiotracer uptake in the tumors suggesting that efflux of <sup>131</sup>I from the tumor cells contributed to the rapid washout of radioactive iodine.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The OAd5/3-NIS facilitates replication-dependent NIS expression that can be visualized through in-vivo imaging and its combination with radioactive iodine can yield a strong therapeutic effect in extra-thyroidal cancers. &nbsp;Additional work in preclinical models is ongoing to investigate the optimal doses and timing of radioactive iodine administration to capitalize on the OAd5/3-NIS mediated expression of the NIS transgene.&nbsp; These studies have built a foundation for a Phase I clinical trial designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of intra-tumoral OAd5/3-NIS followed by two doses of radioactive iodine in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

In the past, our lab has shown that histotripsy potentiates local and abscopal immune responses in both ablated and non-ablated tumors. We sought to better characterize these immune responses and hypothesized that local and abscopal immune infiltration patterns would differ over time.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with bilateral flank hepatocellular carcinoma tumors using 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> Hepa 1-6 cells suspended in PBS and matrigel. Tumors were measured every three days. Between days 8 and 10, unilateral histotripsy was performed. Mice were euthanized, and tumors were harvested at various time points after histotripsy treatment: early (6-24 hours), intermediate (3 days), or late (10-12 days). Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence imaging of fixed tumor sections was performed, utilizing stains for immune cells and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Multiple fields of view were captured per slide, and Keyence BZ-X800 analysis and ImageJ software were used to calculate the number of immune cells or percentage of cells with DAMP release per field of view.&nbsp;&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Imaging demonstrated differences in the timing of immune cell infiltration as well as differences in the types of immune cells infiltrating between treated and untreated tumors. In treated tumors, early inflammatory infiltration of neutrophils, monocytes, and myeloid cells was&nbsp;observed. By&nbsp;later time points, there was also significant natural killer and CD8+ T cell infiltration. In untreated tumors, the early inflammatory response was minimal; however, later infiltration of CD8+ T cells occurred in a similar magnitude to that of treated tumors. HMGB1 translocation in treated and untreated tumors was associated with areas of CD8+ T cell infiltration, indicating the possibility of immune-mediated tumor cell death.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our data suggest&nbsp;that histotripsy treatment causes a rapid myeloid inflammatory response in treated tumors, followed by a lymphocytic response at later time points. This immune response is strong enough to induce abscopal intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration. We are currently investigating the subcellular consequences of histotripsy ablation that could be potentiating this immune response, along with the different mechanisms of cell death seen in tumor cells post-ablation.&nbsp;

Mucins, a family of epithelial glycoproteins, can demonstrate aberrant expression in certain types of cancer.&nbsp;Mucin-5A (MUC5A) is overexpressed early in pancreatic cancer making it a potential targetable biomarker. In the present study, we evaluated an anti-MUC5A antibody labeled with an infrared dye to target and label pancreatic cancer in a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) nude mouse model.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A MUC5A monoclonal antibody was conjugated to IRDye800CW (LICOR, Lincoln, NE) to synthesize MUC5A-IR800.&nbsp;&nbsp;A high MUC5A expressing patient derived pancreatic tumor was identified by Western blotting. This tumor was established by surgical orthotopic implantation as a PDOX model. After 3 weeks of PDOX tumor growth, 50 mcg of MUC5A-IR800 was administered intravenously and in-vivo imaging was performed with the Pearl Trilogy Imager (LICOR, Lincoln, NE) with excitement at 800 nm.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Western blotting demonstrated no MUC5A expression in normal pancreatic tissue and abnormal MUC5A overexpression in all 6 pancreatic cancer lysates tested. The highest MUC5A expressing tumor was established as a PDOX model. After IV administration of 50 mcg of MUC5A-IR800, the highest tumor to background ratio (TBR) in the pancreatic cancer PDOX model was obtained at 48 hours (TBR = 2.5). In-vivo imaging demonstrated clear contrast of the orthotopic tumors with minimal background signal. No toxicity was observed.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
MUC5A-IR800 provides distinct visualization of the PDOX model of pancreatic cancer with a TBR of 2.5 at 48 hours. These results suggest MUC5A-IR800 can be used clinically to improve the outcome of pancreatic cancer surgery. As MUC5A is overexpressed in early precursors of pancreatic cancer, this novel fluorescent probe is also promising for targeting of pre-malignant pancreatic lesions with subsequent resection under fluorescence guidance.&nbsp;

Recent immunotherapy clinical trials showed significant immunoresistance in cortisol-secreting ACC (CS-ACC). We aim to characterize this immunosuppressive signature within the tumor-infiltrating immune cell (TIIC) landscape of CS-ACC to decipher immunoresistance using comprehensive multiplatform computational immunogenomic analytic approaches.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The gene expression profiles of ACC tumors were analyzed and stratified by cortisol hypersecretion (N=33 CS-ACC) using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ACC tumor cohort (N=92). To estimate the TIIC subtypes for immunogenomic pattern analysis, TCGA genomic sequencing data was further deconvoluted with CIBERSORTx computational analytic platform. The Panther Classification System availed generation and selection of significant gene profiles related to immunological processes in ACC. The ACC gene interactions and clustering were assessed with Cytoscape platform. R programing was used to assess the prognostic value of each gene&rsquo;s mRNA expression and DNA methylation. Survival analysis was performed using Cox regression models.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Multiplatform deconstructing analytical assessment of ACC tumors reconstructed a complex immunosuppressive TME in CS-ACC with notably significant depletion of T&gamma;&delta; cells, and increased infiltration of activated dendritic cells (DCa), resting mast cell and neutrophils. Of the 1,021 genes with significantly altered mRNA expression in CS-ACC, 45 (4%) were directly related to immunological processes, of which 44 showed decreased and 1 (CCRL2) showed increased mRNA expression levels in ACC tumor microenvironment (TME). Of these 45 gene hits, the mRNA expression of 19 (42%) were significant prognostic indicators with positive associations for both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in CS-ACC. The DNA methylation of 5 genes associated with significant risk factors and negative associations for OS and DFS had identified&nbsp;GBP2,&nbsp;HLA-F,&nbsp;Jak3,&nbsp;SIRPA,&nbsp;TLR5 genes&nbsp;with altered primary prognostic expression signature in CS-ACC tumors. Significant increase in mRNA expression levels of immunosuppressive CCRL2 and decreased DNA methylation were also observed in CS-ACC tumors. The CCRL2 overexpression was also negatively associated with DFS.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Comprehensive multiplatform immunogenomic computational analyses of ACC tumors unveiled a complex immunosuppressive expression profile with direct impact on survival and poor prognosis in patients with CS-ACC. We identified several primary immunogenomic prognostic indicators and targets within tumor immune landscape of CS-ACC. These important findings will potentiate future studies focusing on identifying novel immunotherapeutic strategies to overcome the immunotherapeutic resistance in patients with CS-ACC tumors.

Westmoreland<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Nemours Children's Hospital,Biomedical Research,Orlando, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;

Despite intensive therapies, late stage breast cancers continue to have poor prognoses.&nbsp; We propose the use of Zika virus as a means of treating these patients.&nbsp; Previous work in neuroblastomas revealed that they are susceptible to Zika virus and the cell surface receptor, CD24, was required for tumor cell lysis.&nbsp; Based upon these findings, we propose that Zika virus infection could be used as a primary or rescue therapy for patients with CD24-presenting triple negative breast cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;&nbsp;

We confirmed by qRT-PCR that CD24 expression was present in four late stage breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, MD-MBA-468, &amp; MD-MBA-231) and examined cell cytotoxicity after treatment with Zika virus.&nbsp; Data was collected every day over an eight day period using fluorescence-based real-time detection assays for kinetic analysis as well as endpoint determination.&nbsp; Cell survival was also directly correlated with examination by bright field microscopy.&nbsp; In addition, the stable knock-down of CD24 by shRNA vectors was screened to determine if the loss of CD24 could be correlated with Zika-viral cytotoxicity.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:


qRT-PCR confirmed that CD24 expression was present in all four breast cancer cell lines at levels comparable to those seen previously in neuroblastoma cells, predicting susceptibility to Zika virus-mediated cell lysis.&nbsp; After treatment with Zika virus, significant increases in cell cytotoxicity were confirmed in as early as 4 days, increasing dramatically and plateauing by day 8.&nbsp; However, greater susceptibility was witnessed in the two triple negative breast cancers (MD-MBA-468, &amp; MD-MBA-231).&nbsp; Examination by bright field microscopy confirmed these results.&nbsp; Knockdown of CD24 in the triple negative cell line MD-MBA-231 was also confirmed to offer resistance to Zika-viral cytotoxicity.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The effectiveness of Zika virus in the treatment of human breast cancer cells correlates with results seen previously in neuroblastomas, with a rate of increase in cell cytotoxicity appearing even more rapid in triple negative cell lines.&nbsp; Previously identified cells that expressed CD24 showed significant susceptibility to Zika virus-mediated tumor cell lysis, a result which is corroborated in triple breast cancer cells, further validating the potential for CD24 as a prognostic marker for Zika efficacy as a therapeutic treatment.

Cohen<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan,Ann Arbor, MI, USA <sup>2</sup>University of Notre Dame,Notre Dame, IN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in all the known hall marks of cancer.&nbsp;To date all Hsp90 inhibitors tested in clinical trials pan-inhibit all 4 isoforms of Hsp90 and have had toxicity issues clinically related to this pan-inhibition. To overcome the detrimental effects of pan Hsp90 inhibition our group has developed the first-in-class isoform-specific Hsp90&beta;&nbsp; inhibitor KUNB105 and have demonstrated the potency and efficacy of this inhibitor in targeting cancer cells. We hypothesize that a comprehensive mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of cancer cells treated with KUNB105 will identify key cancer-specific pathways that are uniquely targeted by&nbsp;Hsp90&beta;&nbsp;isoform specific inhibitionto guide future translational studies.&nbsp;
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patient-derived&nbsp;cell lines, UMSCC22B and UMSCC108, were treated with IC50 values of KUNB105 for 24 hr.&nbsp;From the cell pellet, proteins were isolated, and enzyme digested with trypsin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tryptic peptides were labelled by iTRAQ 8-plex reagent. The labeled samples were analyzed by Orbitrap LC-MS/MS. Protein peaks were identified by TagIdent database search. The m/z values of the experimental protein were searched using UniPortKB/Swiss-Port database of Homo sapiens at a mass tolerance of 0.1% to account for experimental errors. Pathway enrichment analysis was carried out using DAVID, PANTHER, and STRING pathway tools.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;To evaluate the comprehensive estimation of proteins altered by HSP90binhibitor KUNB 105 treatment, we performed the global proteomic analysis by MS after treatment of HNSCC cells with KUNB105. The results from the MS-based proteomic analysis resulted in approximately 2890 differentially regulated proteins. Heat map analysis of the proteins with the greatest expression changes resulted in 15% of this cohort being differentially regulated. Statistically significant proteins (p&lt;0.01 for each comparison) in treatment groups compared to the DMSO treated control group with the largest fold change were calculated using a Volcano plot. Functional pathway enrichment analysis of the significantly regulated proteins indicated targeted alteration of key pathways involved in cell-cell adhesion, protein folding, Wnt signaling, NF-kBpathway, glucose metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, and immune modulation (attached).
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Proteomic analysis revealed that our novel first-in-class Hsp90binhibitor KUNB 105 targets innate immune response, cell cycle, and metabolism of aggressive HNSCC cells and has novel therapeutic rationale for cancer treatment. Further translational in vivo analysis including combination treatment with immunotherapy is warranted to better understand its ideal clinical applications as a novel cancer therapeutic.&nbsp;

Datta<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Miami,Surgery,Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Ras-p53 cooperative mutations, which define &gt;60% of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), promote an immune-excluded tumor microenvironment. Ras-p53 murine models that phenocopy human disease encode a differentially expressed transcriptional program of immunomodulatory genes. Of these candidate genes, we explored the role of Cxcl1&mdash;a ligand for CXCR2 on the immature myeloid compartment&mdash;as a potential mediator of tumor-stoma-immune crosstalk in PDAC.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Mutations in TCGA human PDAC specimens (n=150) as well as 31 human PDAC cell lines were categorized as Ras-p53 cooperative or Ras-alone altered. IHC analysis was performed to evaluate patterns of Cxcl1 expression in human PDAC tissue microarray array (TMA) and PDAC genetically engineered mouse models KrasG12D/+;Trp53fl/+;Pdx1Cre&nbsp;(KPC) and LSL-KrasG12D&nbsp;(KC). CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was used to silence Cxcl1 in KPC-derived tumor cells. The role of tumor-intrinsic Cxcl1 in impacting tumorigenicity and cross-talk with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and immune cells was evaluated.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Cxcl1 was significantly overexpressed in TCGA PDAC vs. normal pancreas. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed progressive increase in Cxcl1 staining in Ras-p53 KPC compared with Ras-alone KC murine tumors, and with increasing tumor stage in human PDAC. Further investigation into the disproportionate stromal Cxcl1 signal in stage IV&mdash;but not stage II/III&mdash;PDAC prompted evaluation of Cxcl1 transcription in ductal vs. fibroblast progenitors in normal human pancreas at single cell resolution, revealing preferential Cxcl1 transcription in ductal, not fibroblastic, precursors. In vitro conditioning of KPC CAFs by exogenous Cxcl1 or pro-inflammatory IL-1&alpha; demonstrated that Cxcl1 is secreted by late-stage KPC CAFs under tumorigenic stress, but not by autocrine regulation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Cxcl1 silencing in KPC cells significantly reduced Mek1 and Stat3 transcription, and diminished tumor migratory potential. In 3D-spheroid co-culture systems with wildtype KPC CAFs, Cxcl1-silenced KPC cells decreased tumor-CAF proliferative kinetics in vivo. Examination of differentially expressed genes between Ras-p53 and Ras-alone human PDAC revealed interwoven transcriptional networks between tumor-intrinsic Cxcl1, stromal Col1a1, and immune Nos1/Nos3&mdash;immature myeloid markers. Indeed, on single cell deconvolution of immune cell populations in human PDAC, Cxcl1 expression strongly correlated with neutrophil, myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC), and macrophage&mdash;but not activated CD8<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell&mdash;signatures, as well as CXCR2<sup>+</sup> CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs. &nbsp;&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Tumor-intrinsic Cxcl1 is a key modulator of tumor-stromal-immune crosstalk in Ras-p53 cooperative PDAC, with distinct effects on stromal signaling and immune infiltration. Targeting this immunomodulatory chemokine in Ras-p53 PDAC may represent a promising strategy to overcome inhibitory stromal-immune interactions in the PDAC tumor microenvironment.

NSCLCs are relatively insensitive to chemotherapy drugs when compared to small cell lung cancer. The leading risk factor accounting for approximately 90% of cases is cigarette smoking. A chemotherapeutic drug-like Doxorubicin (DOX) is currently used for the treatment of recurrent small-cell lung cancer but has several limitations including life-limit dose. The Carfilzomib (CFZ), a second-generation irreversible proteasome inhibitor, has been approved to treat refractory multiple myeloma patients. However, it&#39;s anti-cancerous potential has not been fully elucidated in NSCLCs.&nbsp;In the current investigation, we aim&nbsp;to determine the anticancer efficacy and molecular targets of CFZ in human NSCLC cells.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Three human non-small cell lung cancerous (A549, Calu-1, and H1355) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with FBS at 37C in a humidified atmosphere. Cell viability was determined using the Cell Counting Kit (CCK-8). NSCLC cells were treated with vehicle control (DMSO) or various concentrations CFZ (0-1000nM), DOX (0-3.6&micro;M), and a combination of both to measure the cytotoxicity and anticancer potential. Total RNA was extracted using GenEluteTM Universal kit and concentration and quality were measured using Nanodrop. High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with RNAse inhibitor used to convert total RNA to cDNA. Genes involved in cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways were analyzed by quantitative-RT-PCR and relative expression performed using the delta-delta Ct method, also known as the 2&ndash;??Ct&nbsp;method. RPLP0&nbsp;(Ribosomal Protein Lateral Stalk Subunit P0) was used as a housekeeping gene.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We observed that CFZ&nbsp;significantly dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation of all three NSCLC (A549, Calu-1, and H1355) cells at a 72-hour time-point in comparison to vehicle control (p&lt;0.05, n=4 for each condition).&nbsp; We further observed that CFZ was more sensitive to H1355 than Calu-1 and A549 cells. Nonetheless, DOX modestly but&nbsp;significantly inhibited the proliferation of&nbsp;H1355 and Calu-1&nbsp;cells but had no cytotoxic effect on A549&nbsp;cells.&nbsp; Furthermore, a&nbsp;combination of both CFZ and DOX did not further enhance the rate of growth inhibition in comparison of CFZ alone in three NSCLC cells. CFZ, DOX, and a combination of both down-regulate AKT1, MMP-9 gene expression, and E2F1 transcription factor in A549 cells in comparison to vehicle control&nbsp;(p&lt;0.05,&nbsp;n=4 for each condition).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Novel second-generation proteasome inhibitor&nbsp;CFZ alone has high anti-cancer therapeutic potential in human non-small cell lung cancer cells by downregulating AKT1, MMP-9, and E2F1 genes. The overexpression of these genes is associated with the progression of cancer.&nbsp;Moreover, further&nbsp;in vivo experiments need to confirm&nbsp;to evaluate its antitumorigenic&nbsp;potentials before investigating the clinical trial.

NFATc3 is involved in T cell regulation, and activation of NFATc3 increases CD38, which has been associated with impaired anti-tumor activity in T cells. We hypothesized that SFRP2 activates NFATc3 in T cells with downstream effects on T cell function.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  T-cells cultured in SFRP2 protein (30nM) and IFNg levels were measured on flow cytometry. T cells or two different osteosarcoma cell lines were treated with 10uM of humanized monoclonal antibody to SFPR2 (hSFPR2 mAb) and changes in apoptosis were quantified by flow cytometry. A two-tailed t-test was performed with significance determined as p&lt;0.05. T cells with siRNA silenced NFATc3 were treated with or without SFRP2 (30nM). &nbsp;Protein was analyzed by Western blot for markers of T cell dysfunction and quantified using densitometry.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: IFNg, a pro-inflammatory marker with anti-tumor effects, was significantly decreased by 38% in response to treatment with SFPR2 protein compared to the untreated control (n=3, p&lt;0.05). Treatment of osteosarcoma cells with hSFRP2 mAb resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis in the RF420 cell line to 43.5%&plusmn; 0.16 &nbsp;compared to 4.9%&plusmn; 0.19 in the untreated control (n=12, p&lt;0.001). The second osteosarcoma demonstrated similar results with an increase in apoptosis from 11.8% &plusmn; 0.3 to 52.4% &plusmn; 0.08 &nbsp;after treatment with hSFPR2 mAb (n=12, p&lt;0.001). Conversely, T cells treated with hSFPR2 mAb had no significant effect on apoptosis (n=3). T cells treated with SFRP2 had increased levels of CD38, PD-1, and nuclear NFATc3 protein. In comparison, T cells with knocked down NFATc3 and treated with SFRP2 demonstrated decreased CD38, PD-1, and TNF&alpha; by 50% or more, indicating that NFATc3 is crucial to downstream effects of SFPR2 in T-cells.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: In T cells, SFRP2 decreases IFNg suggesting that SFRP2 negatively impacts T cell anti-tumor activity. We provide evidence suggesting that SFPR2 activates the calcineurin/NFAT pathway and up-regulates CD38 and PD-1. These findings imply NFATc3 plays a role in SFPR2-induced T cell dysfunction. Finally, while blockade of SFPR2 increases tumor apoptosis, it does not negatively impact T cell viability and, therefore, is a potential mechanism to prevent T cell dysfunction in malignancy.

We hypothesized that SMAD4 signaling modulates critical junctional protein expression and intestinal barrier function. Here we examine the role of the canonical TGF&beta; signaling pathway in modulating barrier function in the mouse colon.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Transgenic mice that express a&nbsp;Cre-recombinase&nbsp;gene under the control of an intestinal-specific promoter (Lrig1) and LoxP sites inserted around critical exons of Smad4 gene locus were administered tamoxifen to induce Smad4 loss (Smad4<sup>&Delta;Lrig1</sup>). After recombination, mice were dissected and colon isolated for multiple analyses including RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), western blot (WB), immunofluorescences (IF), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Three-dimensional colon organoids (&ldquo;colonoids&rdquo;) were&nbsp;generated from wild type mice, grown in vitro, and treated with TGF&beta;1/BMP2. Colonoids were additionally generated from Smad4<sup>&Delta;Lrig1&nbsp;</sup>mice and treated with&nbsp;4OH-tamoxifen or vehicle to induce Smad4 knockout&nbsp;or control colonoids, respectively, and qPCR performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Isolated colonocytes from Smad4<sup>&Delta;Lrig1</sup> mice demonstrated a significant increase in Claudin (Cldn)-2 and -8 and a significant decrease in Cldn-3, -4, and -7 gene expression compared to control mice by RNA-seq. Smad4<sup>&Delta;Lrig1</sup> mice additionally demonstrated an increase in CLDN-8 and decrease in CLDN-7 protein expression in their colonic epithelium by WB analysis. Cellular localization of Claudin proteins&nbsp;appeared to be normal&nbsp;by IF in Smad4<sup>&Delta;Lrig1</sup>&nbsp;mice. While control mice demonstrated only luminal bacteria, we detected bacterial translocation across the colon wall in Smad4<sup>&Delta;Lrig1</sup>&nbsp;mice by FISH using the pan-bacterial probe, Eub338. In vitro, treatments of wild type colonoids for 24 hours with&nbsp;TGF&beta;1/BMP2&nbsp;demonstrated decreased Cldn-2 and -8 mRNA expression and increased Cldn-4, -7, and Cdh1 (E-Cadherin) mRNA expression by qPCR (Figure). Conversely, knocking out Smad4 from colonoids in vitro resulted in increased Cldn-2 and -8 and decreased Cldn-4, -7, and Cdh1 mRNA expression compared to Smad4-expressing colonoids.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;SMAD4 loss in mouse colon epithelium is associated with altered junctional protein expression and increased bacterial translocation, and TGF&beta; signaling via SMAD4 appears to directly regulate the expression of junctional proteins in mouse colonocytes. Further investigation is required to determine the mechanism of junctional protein regulation and its implications for colon barrier function and tumorigenesis.

The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has enjoyed some success in various solid malignancies. However, there remains a large cohort of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that do not respond to ICIs, and the challenge remains to find biomarkers that could predict which patients would benefit from these therapies.&nbsp;Platelets have been implicated in promoting tumor metastasis by protecting tumor cells from cell death and promoting tumor cell adhesion.&nbsp;Prior studies have suggested that elevated platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is associated with worse outcomes in various solid cancers. The goal of this study is to investigate the prognostic significance of baseline PLR in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Method</strong>: 

This was a single-institution retrospective analysis of 50 patients with Stage IV HCC who were treated with PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. Baseline PLR was calculated from patient serum obtained prior to initiating therapy and correlated with overall survival (OS). The median PLR value was used as the cutoff mark between high and low PLR.

<br><br><strong>Result</strong>:

Among the 50 patients, the average age was 62&plusmn;10.6 years&nbsp;and 22% were female. The mean follow-up period was 20.2 months (IQR 8.97- 26.05). The median treatment duration was 2.15 months (IQR 1.10-5.23). The majority (60%) had an ECOG score of 0-1 while the remaining 40% had a score of 2. Using the median PLR as the cut-off value, patients were divided into two categories: low PLR (&lt;193.87) and high PLR (&gt;193.87). Patients with low PLR had a significantly higher OS compared to those with high PLR (2.40 versus 1.54 years, p-value 0.011). Subgroup analysis revealed that the effect of low PLR on OS persisted among HCC patients with cirrhosis and those without a history of hepatitis B or C but did not depend on age at diagnosis, gender, ECOG status, and steroid use.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Conclusion

In hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with anti-PD1/PDL1 checkpoint therapy, high PLR is associated with worse survival outcomes. Baseline PLR value is a low cost and readily available biomarker that may be used to help predict response to immune checkpoint therapy in HCC.&nbsp;

Brando<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre,Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Cervical cancer (CC) is a global health problem, being the fourth most common in the female population. The burden of this disease falls on the regions with low socioeconomic development rates, which have as one of the main health issues the disease prevention systems. In Brazil, a country that is part of low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), CC is the third most prevalent in women. One of the main treatments for women who develop CC is surgery, however, it is known that this intervention is determined by the access to qualified surgical centers. It is clear that there is a global disparity in the spectrum of treatment, but it can also exist specifically within the Brazilian scenario. Thus, this study aimed to verify access to surgical treatment for CC in different Brazilian geographic regions, considering access to higher technology procedures such as videolaparoscopic surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
An online database of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) was consulted (Datasus: https://datasus.saude.gov.br/). The diagnostics of CC&nbsp;were verified between January 2013 and December 2019. Also, in the same period, we verified the number of surgical treatments for the disease, with emphasis on the number of total videolaparoscopic hysterectomies performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The SUS offers free health services to the entire Brazilian population, thereby from 2013 to 2019, a total of 1,657,496 diagnostics of all types of cancer were recorded in DATASUS. Among these, 359,242 were treated by surgical interventions. Cervical cancer accounted for a total of 78,429 diagnoses during the period, being 12,822 of them treated by surgery, both open and videolaparoscopic. In the northeast region, which has the lowest average monthly income in the country (R $ 144.90), 14.72% of surgical procedures for cervical cancer were laparoscopic. The northern region, represented by Amazonian states and with a monthly income of R $ 244.30, this same rate was 14.21%. The southeast region, with a monthly income of R $ 273.4, had a total of 42.29% for videolaparoscopic surgery, the higher in the country. In the central-west region, with an average monthly income of R $ 291.30, videolaparoscopic procedures represented 11.5% of the total for cervical cancer. Finally, the southern region with a monthly income of R $ 334.40, obtained a total of 31.24% total videolaparoscopic hysterectomies.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Thus, there is a disparity in access to high-tech surgical treatments for cervical cancer comparing different Brazilian regions. As in the global scenario, in low socioeconomic level locations, there is less access to health treatments, but that burden is even heavier inside Brazil, specially comparing north and south surgical interventions. The lack of distribution of financial support among the country, as long as the difficulty of establishing preventive medicine leads to a lack of homogeneous treatment for the Brazilian population and the cure of patients with the studied disease.

Due to the high cost and volume of data obtained from these experiments, most publications analyze a relatively small number of unique samples. A recent study using scRNASeq on pancreatic islet cell subpopulations noted differing effects between fresh, frozen and fixed samples, suggesting that pre-analytical tissue processing can alter the number and phenotype of cells being examined. Given the scarce tissue available in a post-transplant core needle liver biopsy, we examined existing &lsquo;human liver&rsquo; scRNASeq datasets to determine if different tissue processing techniques alter scRNASeq outputs.

We named these studies: 1. Liver atlas, cholangiocyte and endothelial enriched (LACE<sup>e</sup>), 2. Liver CD45+ enriched (LCD45<sup>e</sup>) and Non-biased Liver (L<sup>nb</sup>). We performed post-experimental analytic extraction of liver-specific immune subsets of cells (CD45+) from each dataset (Figure 1A-C). We combined datasets and performed scRNASeq analysis using Seurat 3.0 R toolkit with dimensionality reduction, clustering, cell type determination, and differential gene expression analysis.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;All three datasets co-clustered by cell type although tighter cluster alignment was seen between LACE<sup>e</sup> and L<sup>nb </sup>(Figure 1D). Cell proportions differed noticeably&nbsp;across sets (Figure 1E). In particular, B cells were scarce but made up a higher proportion in the LCD45<sup>e</sup> dataset (p &lt; 0.01). NK and T cells were the largest subset across all datasets but made up a smaller proportion in the L<sup>nb</sup> cell population (p &lt; 0.01). Gene expression analysis demonstrated greater similarity between the LCD45<sup>e</sup> and the L<sup>nb</sup> liver dataset (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91, Figure 1H), and comparison of the LACE<sup>e</sup> data to the L<sup>nb</sup> and LCD45<sup>e</sup> studies showed decreased transcriptome concordance (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.66 and&nbsp;R<sup>2</sup> = 0.61 respectively, Figure 1F,G)


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our study demonstrates that scRNASeq data for immune cell populations in human liver exhibit variability, perhaps as a consequence of tissue preparation techniques as well as biologic heterogeneity. Even though immune cell populations co-cluster, differential gene expression was common, particularly when comparing different scRNASeq techniques. As research using scRNASeq methods continues to expand, standardization of tissue processing techniques should be taken into account when interpreting data.

Dudeja<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Miami,Surgery,Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Pancreatic cancer is an immunologically cold tumor. Immunotherapy has been extensively evaluated for improving therapeutic outcomes but has shown disappointing results. TLR-4 agonism is one of the avenues being investigated for immunomodulation, with evidence for both pro and anti-tumorigenic effects. The present study explores the effects of TLR4 agonism on pancreatic cancer progression and recurrence.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide(LPS) derived from E. coli was utilized for TLR4-agonism. 2 months old KPC (Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>;LSL-Trp53<sup>R172H/+;</sup>Pdx-1-Cre) mice, a genetically modified model of aggressive pancreatic cancer, were randomized into treatment with control (saline) or LPS once weekly in a survival study. In a separate experiment, C57BL/6J (WT) mice were orthotopically implanted with KPC tumors followed by randomization into saline or LPS treatment for two doses 1 week apart. Tumors were resected at 4 weeks. Long-term survivors (survival &gt; 6 months post-resection) were again challenged with subcutaneous KPC tumors. Finally, mice were given KPC tumors subcutaneously followed by randomization into saline or LPS treatment. Splenocytes from these mice were adoptively transferred to another set of C57BL/6J mice bearing subcutaneous KPC tumors.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;LPS treatment resulted in significantly longer survival in KPC mice as well as more long-term survivors post resection of orthotopic tumors in WT mice. On subcutaneous tumor re-challenge to long-term survivors, LPS sensitized mice showed smaller tumors when compared to the saline treated group indicating persisting antitumor immunity. Flowcytometric analysis of tumors from LPS treated mice revealed increased CD4+ T-cell infiltration along with decreased expression of PD-1 as compared to saline treated mice. On adoptive transfer, splenocytes from LPS treated mice resulted in decreased tumor burden in the recipient mice when compared to splenocytes from control mice. Splenocytes on LPS treatment showed increased IFN-&gamma; production in vitro.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our findings provide a novel insight into how TLR4 agonism can stimulate immune-checkpoint escape and long-term antitumor immunity which can be harnessed as potential sources for immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer.

Chen<sup>1</sup>, R. White<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Diego,Moores Cancer Center,San Diego, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Although immunotherapy has provided revolutionary clinical results in many solid tumors, it has had only limited efficacy in pancreatic cancer (PC). Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a non-thermal ablative therapy in clinical use for selected patients with locally advanced PC. Previous studies have shown that IRE can generate tumor-specific immune responses, but the immune effects of IRE alone are not sufficient to eradicate distant metastatic disease. Post-translational protein modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is upregulated in cancer and is important for the function of immune checkpoints (i.e., PD-L1). TAK-981 is a novel inhibitor of SUMOylation that has demonstrated induction of potent anti-tumor&nbsp;immune responses&nbsp;in preclinical models.&nbsp;Our hypothesis is that TAK-981 will augment the effects of IRE in an immunocompetent orthotopic mouse model of PC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The PC cell line (KPC4580P) was derived from an autochthonous tumor arising in a genetically engineered mouse model (KPC). The tumors were implanted orthotopically into the tail of the pancreas via laparotomy. Once tumors reached 5-7 mm in diameter, mice were randomized to one of four treatment groups: IRE alone, TAK-981 alone, IRE + TAK-981, or no treatment. IRE (150 x 90 microsec pulses at 1500 V/cm) was performed once through a second laparotomy (versus sham laparotomy in the non-IRE groups). TAK-981 (7.5mg/kg) versus vehicle was delivered via subcutaneous injection twice weekly x four doses, starting on the day of IRE. Tumors were harvested on day 14 for analysis of tumor infiltrating leukocytes by flow cytometry.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Ultrasound was performed on days 8, 14 and 20 after initiation of treatment. Tumor growth in the IRE + TAK-981 group was significantly inhibited compared to sham-treated tumors (Fig. 1, *p=0.0002), and this effect persisted to day 20, even after treatment with TAK-981 was stopped on day 11 (p &lt;0.01).&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow cytometry revealed a greater than 2-fold increase in CD8+ T-cells (p &lt;0.05)&nbsp;and 4-fold increase in IFN-gamma+ CD8+ T-cells (p=0.01) in tumors treated with the combination relative to sham-treated tumors.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our results suggest that the combination of IRE with TAK-981 is associated with better local tumor control. Since this combination showed a significant increase of CD8+ T-cells and IFN-gamma+ CD8+ T-cells, we expect that this combination might contribute systemic immune responses that would prevent or even eradicate distant metastasis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that immunosuppression mediated by PD-L1 is regulated by ubiquitination, targeting post-translational-modification through TAK-981 might also render PC responsive to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
the concentration of serum MPO-DNA was significantly higher in alcoholic steatosis and alcoholic HCC patients than no alcohol consumption control. In vivo, intrahepatic inflammation markers and HCC related pathways increased in NE -/- mice, and decreased steatosis grade and HCC genesis when compared with WT mice.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is effective in improving survival, symptoms, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with severe coronary artery disease. However, limited studies have used heart disease-specific QoL instruments to evaluate CABG patients from the Deep South. Using patient-reported survey data from a mobile health application, we aimed to evaluate pre-operative and post-operative QoL using multiple instruments, including general and disease-specific measures. We hypothesized that the disease-specific instrument will be more sensitive in detecting differences in QoL for CABG patients from the Deep South.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We prospectively enrolled CABG patients in the Deep South to utilize a patient-engagement health application, SeamlessMD. This mobile health application focused on providing patients with surgical self-care education and collecting patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at pre-operative, 30-day and 90-day post-discharge periods using three instruments, a generic (PROMIS), a utility (EQ-5D), and a disease-specific instrument (KCCQ-12). Descriptive statistics and exploratory analyses were conducted to evaluate PROs before and after the CABG.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

From July 2019 to May 2020, 133 CABG patients (30 women and 31 blacks) were enrolled with a median age of 62 years (range: 37-85). Of those patients, 64 completed the pre-op QoL survey, 46 completed the 30-day post-discharge, and 25 completed the 90-day post-discharge. The PROMIS scores showed significant improvements in physical health (p=0.01) and emotional problems (p&lt;0.001) at 90-day post-discharge. The EQ-5D instrument indicated a significant improvement in pain, anxiety/depression (p&lt;0.01), and overall QoL measured by both the index score (p=0.02) and the visual analogue score (p&lt;0.01) over 90 days. Table 1 displays the disease-specific instrument&mdash;KCCQ-12, which identified significant improvements in all the domains of QoL. The range of KCCQ&nbsp;scores is 0 to 100 (higher indicating better QoL). Participants reported increased heart-related quality of life as well as reductions in their symptom frequencies, social limitations, and physical limitations due to their heart condition.&nbsp;



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

CABG is an effective surgical procedure regarding improving QoL for patients in the Deep South. The disease-specific instrument, KCCQ-12, demonstrated to be a more sensitive measure to detect QoL change compared to general QoL measures. Evaluating these patient-reported outcomes is important in understanding how CABG patient&rsquo;s perspectives of their general and heart-related QoL change over time, and findings can inform future developments of culturally tailored interventions for improving outcomes in CABG patients from the Deep South.

Right heart failure (RHF) is a devastating complication after LVAD placement and is very unpredictable. Assisted circulation of the left ventricle (LV) with an LVAD device could unmask an underlying RHF. However, otherwise healthy right ventricles (RVs) can develop RHF after LVAD placement&nbsp;due to poor adaptation to new filling pressures and altered hemodynamics. It has been proposed that preoperative volumetric measurements in the pulmonary and systemic vasculature may serve as indicators for a risk of RHF after LVAD implantation. The aim of this study is to examine a potential relationship of preoperative hemodynamic values such as pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) and central venous pressure over pulmonary wedge pressure (CVP/PWP) as preoperative predictors for RHF post LVAD placement.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing initially planned isolated LVAD implantation with or without concomitant procedures in our institution from January 1, 2017 to June 12, 2020. Data were gathered from hemodynamic records, echocardiographic interpretations, and clinical notes. Patients who had RHF after LVAD implantation but without hemodynamic data available within 14 days from the operation were excluded. Univariate analysis was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 114 patients who received planned isolated LVAD surgery, 70 (61.4%) experienced RHF within the first 7 days post-operatively. PAPi did not correlate significantly with RHF vs non-RHF among LVAD recipients (3.1 &plusmn; 2.1 vs. 3.8 &plusmn; 3.4 P=0.21). Pre-op CVP/PWP did not different significantly between RHF and non-RHF patients (0.4 &plusmn; 0.2 vs 0.5 &plusmn; 0.8 P= 0.277). There was a correlation between elevated pre-op PWP and those with RHF vs those without, OR= 1.05 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.10). Preop systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SysPAP) was elevated in patients with post-LVAD RHF compared to those without (51.3 &plusmn; 12.3 vs 47.2 &plusmn; 13.0, P= 0.093).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Preoperative hemodynamic variables such as PAPi or CVP/PWP did not show a significant correlation predicting RHF post LVAD implantation. Acute RHF post LVAD implantation remains a complex medical entity. Several studies have devised multivariable risk scores; however, their performance has been limited. More prospective studies are needed to accurately demonstrate how pre-operative hemodynamics could predict and help prevent this catastrophic complication.

Respiratory failure necessitating tracheostomy after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation is a major postoperative development. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors for post-operative respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy in patients undergoing LVAD implantation and to investigate clinical outcomes after tracheostomy in this patient population. We hypothesized that patients undergoing tracheostomy would be at increased risk of adverse outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Retrospective review of 665 patients who underwent LVAD implantation at our institution from August 2002 through December 2019. Of these patients, post-operative respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy occurred in 105 (15.8%). Preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for tracheostomy were evaluated, and post-operative outcomes were assessed following a propensity score matching analysis. After propensity matching, 104 matched pairs of tracheostomy and non-tracheostomy patients were compared for mortality and adverse events. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In the unmatched total cohort, patients requiring tracheostomy were older (58.1&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;11.5 vs 54.6&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;13.1 years, p=0.01), implanted more often for destination therapy (55.4% vs 41.9%, p=0.046, had more preoperative mechanical circulatory support (64% vs 45.9%, p=0.01), more previous sternotomies (51.1% vs 33.7%, p=0.01), lower preoperative hemoglobin levels (10.7g/dL&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;2.1 vs. 11.7g/dL&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;2.2, p&lt;0.001), and higher baseline serum creatinine values (1.8&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;1.0 vs. 1.4&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;0.7, p&lt;0.001 After propensity score matching the two groups were comparable for these risk factors.&nbsp; During a mean follow?up of 1.5 &plusmn;2.0 years, the mortality in the tracheostomy (76.0%, n=79) was higher than the non-tracheostomy group (46.2%, n=48; p&lt;0.001). Tracheostomy was an independent risk factor for mortality with an odds ratio of 1.6 [95% confidence interval: 1.2&ndash;2.1;&nbsp;P&nbsp;&lt;0.001]. The risk of postoperative renal failure and reoperation for bleeding were also found to be associated with tracheostomy. (Table)

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Tracheostomy was found to be an independent predictor of decreased survival after LVAD implantation. These data emphasize appropriate patient selection and optimal perioperative management to reduce the incidence of tracheostomy after CF-LVAD implantation given the high association with mortality and adverse outcomes.

Persistent opioid use after lung resection rates are high, but the influence of coping is unknown. We hypothesized that patients using maladaptive coping would have greater rates of persistent opioid use after lung resection surgery compared to patients using only adaptive coping mechanisms.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Forty-four patients undergoing lung resections from 2018-2019 at a single, high volume tertiary hospital were surveyed pre-operatively using the validated Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) survey, which includes 14 coping mechanisms using a 4 point Likert scale. Groups were defined as adaptive-only copers (only adaptive coping strategies used) and maladaptive copers (at least one maladaptive coping strategy used). Patient demographic data and perioperative outcomes were collected prospectively. Opioid use was determined using the Michigan Automated Prescription System (MAPS) data base. Persistent opioid use was defined as prescription refill at 90-days post-operation. Chi-square and Fisher&rsquo;s Exact Tests were performed to measure the significance of postoperative opioid use between coping mechanisms. Multivariable logistical regression was used to determine the significance of demographic and preoperative risk factors in persistent opioid use.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Average age was 65 years with 55% (24) being male and 93% (41) self-identified as Caucasian. Prior medical conditions were not significantly different between groups. At least one maladaptive coping strategy was utilized by 55% (24) of patients (maladaptive copers) and only adaptive coping strategies (adaptive copers) in 45% (20) of patients. Acceptance was the most commonly used coping strategy (96%, 42). Self-distraction was the most commonly used maladaptive coping strategy (39%, 17). Preoperative chemotherapy (6/44) was associated with increased maladaptive coping (P=0.02). 18% (8) used opioids prior to operation. There was no difference between groups in preoperative opioid use (15% (3/20) adaptive; 21% (5/24) maladaptive). 75% (33/44) were discharged with opioid prescriptions, and only 9% (4) used opioids at 90-day follow-up. There was no difference between coping strategies and rate of persistent opioid use. Refill rates were similar between the two groups (mean=21.2 and 23.58 refills for maladaptive and adaptive groups, respectively). Male gender and history of marijuana use were independently and significantly associated with postoperative persistent opioid use (p=0.02, p=0.04, respectively).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Preoperative maladaptive coping does not predict postoperative persistent opioid use after lung resection for cancer. Although our study size was limited, history of marijuana use and gender were associated with persistent opioid use. Future studies should focus on the influence of coping on postoperative opioid usage across operations.&nbsp;

Previous studies suggest that patients with multiple rib fractures have poor outcomes but it is unknown if isolated single rib fractures (SRF) are associated with morbidity or mortality. We hypothesize that patients with poor outcomes after SRF could be identified by demographics, comorbidities, and injury severity. The purpose of this study was to model adverse outcome after single rib fractures.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We used the 2016 National Inpatient Sample to identify patients with single rib fractures associated with blunt trauma using ICD-10 coding. Comorbidities and abbreviated injury score (AIS) were also extracted. Patients with non-chest trauma were excluded. The primary outcome was an adverse composite outcome of death, pneumonia, tracheostomy, or hospitalization longer than 12 days. One-third of the cohort was reserved for validation. Backward selection multivariable modeling was performed to identify factors associated with adverse composite outcome. The model was used to create a nomogram to predict adverse composite outcome. The nomogram was then tested using the validation cohort.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
2,398 patients with isolated SRF were divided into training (n=1,598) and validation sets (n=800). The average age was 69 and the majority were male (66%) and received care at academic institutions (61.6%). The adverse composite outcome occurred in 20.8%: 61 deaths (2.5%), 67 tracheostomies (2.8%), 319 pneumonias (13.3%), and 165 patients with LOS &gt;12 days (6.9%). Results of stepwise multivariable modeling have a c-statistic of 0.700. The multivariable model was used to create a nomogram (Figure 1), which has a c-statistic of 0.672 in the validation cohort.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
20% of isolated SRF patients had an adverse outcome. Demographics and comorbidities can be used to identify and triage high-risk patients for specialized care and proper patient/family counseling.

Prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (PCPBT) during operations for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) may lead to worse postoperative outcomes, which could add a significant burden to hospitals in developing countries. This study aimed to identify risk factors and outcomes of PCPBT in patients undergoing operations for ACHD.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This retrospective study included all adult patients (?18 years) who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass for their congenital heart defect from 2011-2016 at a tertiary-care private hospital in Pakistan. Prolonged CPBT was defined as CPBT &gt; 120 minutes (65<sup>th</sup> percentile).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

This study included 166 patients (53.6% males) with a mean age of 32.05 &plusmn; 12.11 years. Comorbid disease was present in 59.0% of patients. Most patients underwent atrial septal defect repair (42.2%). A total of 58 (34.9%) of patients had a PCPBT. Postoperative complications occurred in 38.6% of patients. Multivariable analysis adjusted age, gender and RACHS-1 Categories showed that mild preoperative left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was associated with PCPBT (OR: 3.137 [95% CI: 1.003-9.818]), while obesity was found to be protective (0.346 [0.130-0.923]). PCPBT was also associated with a longer duration of ventilation (1.298 [1.005-1.676]), longer cardiac ICU stay (1.204 [1.061-1.367]) and longer hospital stay (1.120 [1.005-1.247]).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

While mild preoperative LV dysfunction was associated with PCPBT, obesity was found to be protective. Postoperatively, PCPBT was associated with longer duration of ventilation, cardiac ICU stay, and hospital stay. Operations with shorter CPBT may help minimize the occurrence and impact of these postoperative adverse outcomes especially in resource-constrained developing countries.

Compared to pre-ECMO, pre-decannulation period significantly improved in pH (7.23 &plusmn; 0.19 vs. 7.40 &plusmn; 0.09; p&lt;0.001), lactate (5.5 [2.3, 9.0] vs. 1.6 [0.9, 2.3]; p&lt;0.001) and serum creatinine (1.4 [1.1, 2.1] vs. 1,1 [0.8, 1.7]; p&lt;0.001).&nbsp; Significant changes were noted in ventilation parameters as well, such as FiO2 (100 [100, 100] vs. 50 [50, 50]; p&lt;0.001), PaO<sub>2</sub> (88 [62,135], 126 [87,162]; p&lt;0.001) and PEEP (8.0 [5.0, 12.0] vs. 5.0 [5.0, 8.0]; p&lt;0.001). Decrease in vasopressor dosages was reflected with the vasoactive-inotropic score (120.0 [13.3, 442.5] vs. 0.0 [0.0, 3.9]; p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Maintaining perfusion with VA-ECMO utilization on indicated patients demonstrated improvements in end-organ functions.&nbsp; Survival rates of VA-ECMO patients were also optimistic.

Chest malignancies in the pediatric population are rare, with surgical resection being a treatment option depending on the nature, location and size of the lesion. We present our institutional experience of chest masses in the pediatric population of a lower-middle-income country, with the aim to describe the spectrum of diagnoses as well as surgical management and outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
ICD Codes were used to identify pediatric patients (&le; 18 years) who presented to a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, over the period January 2010-December 2019. A structured proforma was used to collect patient information.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 36 patients with mean age of 8.67 &plusmn; 6.25 years were included in this series. The majority (23; 63.9%) of patients were males.

Masses were most commonly located in the anterior mediastinum (29; 80.6%). The commonest malignancies were Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (18; 50%), Germ Cell Tumor (5; 13.9%), Neuroblastoma (4; 11.1%) and Hodgkin Lymphoma (3; 8.3%).

Surgery was performed in 15 (41.7%) patients with 2 (5.6%) being emergency procedures. 7 (46.7%) patients undergoing surgery received pre-operative chemotherapy.

The commonest malignancies for which surgery was performed were Germ Cell Tumor (5; 33.3%), Non-Hodgkin (3; 20%) and Neuroblastoma (2; 13.3%). Mean duration of surgeries was 153.13 &plusmn; 71.99 minutes. The commonest surgical approaches were Median Sternotomy (7; 46.7%) and Postero-lateral Thoracotomy (3; 20%).

Post-operative complications were seen in 5 (33.3%) patients, including sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, hypoxia and pneumothorax. 8 patients (53.3%) received postoperative chemotherapy. There was no in-hospital or 30-day mortality in the 15 patients who underwent surgery.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Surgical resection, coupled with preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy, is frequently performed in the management of pediatric chest malignancies, with relatively few postoperative complications and mortality.

This analysis investigated whether OPCAB compared to ONCAB, can reduce GIC after CABG.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Authors systematically searched from inception to May 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020, and harvested relevant studies which addressed the association between off-pump strategy and postoperative GIC. Studies were stratified depending on the use of rigorously confounder-adjusted method. Data from selected studies were reviewed independently by two researches.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We included 26&nbsp;studies (ten confounder-adjusted, twelve unadjusted observational studies, and four randomized clinical trials) with aggregated data on 200 thousand individuals and more than 3000 GIC cases. General incidence of GIC is approximately 1.40%, which showed a good agreement for consistency of former epidemiologic evidences. Off-pump strategy was significantly associated with a lower risk of GIC after CABG in RCTs (OR:0.27, 95% CI:0.08-0.94), and observational studies with confounder-adjusted estimates (OR:0.84, 95% CI:0.73-0.97).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Current evidences illustrated OPCAB is significantly associated with lower risk of postoperative GIC. Among CABG patients, off-pump surgical techniques should be evaluated in individual cases to provide the best outcome for each case.

Understanding patient-reported outcomes before and after AVR can assist with better informed patient-centered decision making and tailored care management. We aimed to assess pre-operative and post-operative quality of life (QoL) in adult AVR patients using various QoL measures and to identify a QoL measure with the greatest sensitivity.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;AVR patients were prospectively enrolled to use a patient-engagement mobile application for receiving surgical self-care management educational materials and reporting patient-reported outcomes (PROs) measured by a generic (PROMIS Global10), a health utility (EQ-5D), and a heart disease-specific measure&mdash;the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12). Descriptive statistics and exploratory analyses were conducted to evaluate these PROs at pre-operative, 30-day, and 90-day post-discharge periods.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;From July 2019 to May 2020, 130 AVR patients were enrolled. Among them, 75 patients completed the pre-operative, 59 completed the 30-day post-discharge, and 35 completed the 90-day post-discharge PROs. Improvements in QoL after AVR were detected by all the PRO measures. However, the domains of these QoL improvements differed across these measures. PROMIS Global 10 revealed reduced emotional problems, EQ-5D identified better self-care, and KCCQ-12 captured enhancements in all the domains, including physical limitation, symptom frequency, quality of life, social limitation, and the overall score (Table).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;QoL enhancements after AVR are detected by generic, health utility, and disease-specific PRO measures. Though, a disease-specific measure&mdash;KCCQ-12&mdash;has the greatest sensitivity assessing various domains of QoL in AVR patients. Patient-centered decision making and care management strategies can be better tailored based on these disease-specific QoL measures.&nbsp;

Sternal fractures (SF) occur in 3-8% of blunt thoracic trauma. The impact of SF in geriatric patients (&ge; 65 y.o) has been insufficiently examined. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes between geriatric patients (GP) and non-geriatric patients (NGP) with SF.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This retrospective cohort analysis included 404 patients with SF who were admitted to two level 1 trauma centers from 2015 to 2019. GP (n=202) were compared with NGP (n=202). Analyzed variables included age, comorbidities, pre-injury anticoagulation use, mechanism of injury (MOI), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), characteristics of SF, co-injuries, retrosternal hematoma, cardiac contusion, ICU admissions, hospital discharge disposition, and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
GP were almost twice as old as NGP (79.3 vs 44.0 p&lt;0.001). Motor vehicle collision was the most common MOI in both groups (&gt;78.0%). GP had significantly more comorbidities and anticoagulation use [Fig 1]. GCS was higher in GP (14.4 vs 13.2, p&lt;0.001) and ISS was lower (12.1 vs 15.2, p=0.002). Most co-injuries were similar between both groups, however pulmonary co-injuries were statistically less common in GP (26.7% vs 42.1%, p=0.001). Overall, types of SF (manubrium vs sternal body) and rate of displacement (23.8% vs 29.9%) were similar between GP and NGP, both p&gt;0.2. Retrosternal hematoma was more common in GP (30.7% vs 21.8%, p=0.04). Concomitant rib fractures were higher in GP (50.5% vs 40.1%, p=0.04), while vertebrae (39.1% vs 40.0%), clavicle (7.9% vs 11.9%), and scapula (2.5% vs 4.0%) concomitant fractures were comparable (p&gt;0.1). Cardiac contusion, confirmed by an abnormal ECG in combination with elevated enzymes and/or an abnormal ECHO, was more common in GP (27.7% vs 14.9%, p&lt;0.001). ICU admissions (55.9% vs 55.4%, p=0.9) were similar. Discharge disposition included discharge home, to skilled nursing facility, rehabilitation center, or hospice and was statistically different between both groups (p&lt;0.001). GP went to hospice more often than NGP (7.9% vs 1.0%, p&lt;0.001), and those who did all had signed Do Not Resuscitate orders. Mortality was significantly higher in GP (11.4% vs 5.0%, p=0.02) and was most often due to comorbidities and thoracic trauma in combination with abdominal co-injuries. Additionally, all expired GP had combined SF with other thoracic fractures. Mortality in NGP was most often due to traumatic brain injury.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Injury severity was higher in non-geriatric patients but mortality was higher in geriatric patients which was attributed to a higher rate of comorbidities, concomitant thoracic injuries and discharge to hospice. Isolated sternal did not contribute to worse outcomes and all GP had combined SF.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a protocol change that mandated routine incorporation of head computed tomography angiography (CTA) for the work-up of suspected blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) at an academic Level I trauma center.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The BCVI screening guideline at our institution was changed in November 18, 2018 to include the addition of a head CTA for all patients receiving a neck CTA for the evaluation of possible BCVI. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with a diagnosed BCVI between November 2018 and November 2019. Adults age 18 and older who had BCVI were included in the study. A total of 319 patients (88 females, 231 males) fit this criteria and had a head CTA as part of their trauma workup. The head CTA findings were compared to the findings in the neck CTA and non-contrast head CT scans completed at the time of the initial trauma evaluation.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Findings that could potentially alter a patient&#39;s clinical course were identified in 6.6% (n=21) of the head CTA&rsquo;s. These included active bleeds (n= 7), vessel occlusions (n=3), aneurysms (n=1), and vasospasms (n=3). Addition of CTA allowed prompt identification of active bleeding in 7 patients with intracranial hematomas. Of the 21 patients with positive findings on head CTA, 3 received neurosurgical intervention, 1 underwent a subsequent diagnostic cerebral angiogram, and 3 were managed medically.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

In patients with clinically suspected BCVI, the addition of head CTA to the existing BCVI screening guideline identified vascular abnormalities in almost 7% of cases. Further study is needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.&nbsp;

Nasr<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Chicago Medical School - Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science,Chicago, IL, USA <sup>2</sup>Detroit Medical Center,Orthopaedic Surgery,Detroit, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a medical emergency that occurs after major trauma or vascular injury to an extremity. Elevated pressure in a fascial compartment impedes blood flow to local muscle and nerves, resulting in tissue ischemia, necrosis and in serious cases, limb amputation and death. In ACS of the lower leg, an emergency fasciotomy is performed to decompress all four compartments (anterior, lateral, deep posterior, and superficial posterior). This allows the surgeon to release the fascia that is compressing the underlying muscle, nerves, and blood vessels. In a single-incision fasciotomy, a surgeon makes a single cut via a paratibial, transfibular, or parafibular route. Double-incision fasciotomy involves anterolateral and posteromedial incisions. Currently, there is no consensus on which technique is better for the management of leg fractures when ACS arises. This study compares the surgical techniques, functional outcomes, and complication rates of single and double-incision fasciotomies in fractures of the lower leg.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A systematic review of the literature published in Pubmed on single and double-incision fasciotomies identified 3040 records. Forty-nine primary studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in our final review. The inclusion criteria included studies published in 1970 or later, involving human subjects, reporting clinical outcomes of classical four-compartment fasciotomies performed in cases of acute compartment syndrome in lower leg fractures, including at least 1 patient.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Both single and double-incision four-compartment fasciotomies are successful in treating lower-extremity acute compartment syndrome. Studies suggest that the choice of fasciotomy is based on surgeon familiarity with the techniques and patient condition. The single-incision fasciotomy requires experienced hands and is less commonly performed, with some citing a higher risk of incomplete decompression and nerve injury. Either technique does not have elevated nonunion risk or infection rate. Additionally, operative timing, closure, and fixation techniques can significantly impact patient outcomes, influencing infection rate, wound healing, and length of hospital stay.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Single and double-incision four-compartment fasciotomies are effective in the operative management of lower-extremity acute compartment syndrome. Double-incision fasciotomy remains widely preferred by surgeons due to technique familiarity and ease of full compartment release, although the comparative efficacy and safety of single-incision fasciotomy are equal when evaluated within the same study. An understanding of the risks of the various techniques in four-compartment fasciotomy can help prevent unnecessary complications for patients. These findings may be used to guide the surgical community when determining the optimal incision-type to use in compartment syndrome emergencies for lower-extremity fracture cases.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This is a retrospective study in a community based ACS Level 2-Trauma Center. &nbsp;We reviewed a total of 470 patients between January 2018 - June 2020. &nbsp;Inclusion criteria include patients over age 65 with isolated hip fractures. &nbsp;We excluded polytrauma and pathological fractures. &nbsp;Primary end-point include in-patient mortality. &nbsp;Secondary endpoints include perioperative outcome measures such as UTI, HCAP, DVT, &nbsp;hospital readmission, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay and nutritional status. &nbsp;Patients were stratified into mild (0-3), moderate (3-5) and severe (5-7) frailty using the Rockwood Frailty Index. &nbsp;SAS9.4 was used to perform statistical analysis. &nbsp;Parametric data expressed as proportions were evaluated by Chi-Square tests and t-tests for continuous data. &nbsp;Nonparametric data were evaluated by Fisher&#39;s exact test for proportions and the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test for continuous data

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We identified 470 patients with isolated traumatic hip fractures who were stratified by mild (N=316), moderate (N=123) and severe (N=31) frailty. &nbsp;Frailty worsened with increasing age (p&lt;0.0001). &nbsp;Those who were less frail were discharged home (p&lt;0.04). &nbsp;Severely frail patients were more likely to be discharged to hospice (p&lt;0.01). &nbsp;Severely frail patients also were more likely to develop DVT (p&lt;0.04) and have poorer nutritional status (p&lt;0.02). &nbsp;There were no differences amongst groups for in-patient mortality.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Severely frail patients are more likely to develop perioperative complications and be discharged to hospice care. &nbsp;The Rockwood frailty score is a reliable objective tool to identify high-risk patients, and guide goals of care discussion for operative intervention in isolated traumatic hip fractures.

Goodman<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Cincinnati,Department Of Surgery,Cincinnati, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Thrombocytosis and leukocytosis are common physiologic findings following splenectomy. In the setting of traumatic splenectomy, platelet counts (PLT) greater than 1 million have been associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE), while white blood cell (WBC) counts greater than 15,000, along with PC/WBC ratios &lt; 20 after postoperative day 5, correlate with increased risk of infection. The effect of elective splenectomy on these physiological changes is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the differences in thrombocytosis in emergency versus elective splenectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent elective and emergency splenectomy at a large academic medical center between January 2013 &ndash; March 2020. Patient records were queried for PLT and WBC count prior to splenectomy, postoperative days 1-5, and on day 14. PLT was additionally noted at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year following splenectomy. Post-operative complications were recorded, including VTE, infection, need for repeat operation, need for percutaneous drainage of fluid collections, and readmission within 30 days of discharge. A repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to determine if there was a difference between the emergent and elective cohorts over time.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
476 patients were identified as being eligible for the study, with 178 patients in the elective cohort and 298 patients in the emergency cohort. Mean PLT was higher in the emergency cohort at 4 days, 2 weeks, and at 1 month after splenectomy. WBC count was higher in the emergency cohort pre-operatively, but there were no postoperative differences. PLT/WBC ratio was lower in the emergency cohort pre-operatively, but higher at postoperative days 3 and 14 after surgery. Emergency cases had greater reoperation rates (7.4% vs. 2.3%, p=0.02) despite incurring fewer readmissions within 30 days (10.8% vs. 24.7%, p&lt;0.01).&nbsp; There were no differences in postoperative VTE, infection, or need for percutaneous drainage between the groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Post-splenectomy thrombocytosis appears to peak at 2 weeks postoperatively. While patients who undergo emergency splenectomy may have a persistently higher PLT, the PLT/WBC ratio is only transiently affected compared to elective splenectomy patients. Importantly,&nbsp;the risk of VTE or infection did not differ between the cohorts. These findings suggest that the relationship between post-splenectomy thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, VTE, and infection respectively is not simply reflective of temporal changes in platelet and WBC counts alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Over 700,000 patients in the United States have chronic renal failure (CRF). Treating CRF patients in the trauma setting is complex as this disease process must be addressed in addition to the acute injury. While many studies have investigated the impact of acute kidney injury (AKI) on trauma patients, there is a paucity of similar information regarding CRF on trauma patients. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of CRF on trauma patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A matched case-controlled design was used to analyze the impact of CRF on traumatic outcomes using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) records from 2011-2016. Outcomes of interest included complications, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, ventilator days, and 30 day mortality. Data analysis consisted of 2 sample t-tests, Chi square tests, and conditional logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
2,618 patients with CRF were identified and matched to 5,140 controls. In the absence of complications, CRF patients had a higher risk of mortality after adjusting for injury severity score and the Glasgow Coma Scale (OR:17.5, p=0.0035). The mean hospital LOS (p&lt;0.0001), ICU LOS (p=0.0050), and ventilator days (p=0.0035) were significantly higher for CRF patients. AKI in CRF patients increased both mean hospital LOS and ICU LOS by 5 days, and ventilator days by 13 days.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We found that CRF was independently associated with a higher risk of mortality in trauma patients. CRF patients have a higher risk of morbidity that is worsened by concurrent AKI. Our study highlights the importance of prevention of progression to CRF in the general public as well as injury prevention in this specific at-risk population.

State transportation databases have limited data regarding injury severity of pedestrian vs. automobile patients. In an effort to identify opportunities to reduce injury severity, we integrated the state transportation and trauma databases to identify the impact of signaled street crossings (SC) vs. non-signaled street crossings (NSC) on injury severity.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Single center retrospective review of all pedestrian vs. automobile patients treated at an ACS-verified level 1 trauma center from 2014-2018 was performed. Patients were matched to state transportation database by name, gender, and date of crash. Google Earth Pro version 7.3 satellite imagery with crash-specific data was used to identify SC vs NSC. Injury severity of pedestrians struck at SC was compared to those at NSC.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 512 patients were matched (mean age=41.2&plusmn;18.5 years, 74% male). Pedestrians struck at SC (n=206) had lower ISS (10.8&plusmn;10 vs. 18.9&plusmn;13.2, p&lt;0.001), hospital length of stay (3[0&ndash;73] vs. 6[0&ndash;118] days, p&lt;0.001), and mortality (21[10%] vs. 52[17%], p=0.04), as compared to those struck at NSC (n=206). Furthermore patients struck at SC had lower frequencies of sustaining an AIS &ge; 3 injury in the head (17% vs. 36%, p&lt;0.001), chest (20% vs. 36%, p&lt;0.001), abdomen (2% vs. 13%, p&lt;0.001), or extremity regions (19% vs. 36%, p&lt;0.001), compared to those &nbsp;struck at NSC.

We additionally compared the accuracy of the transportation database classification for injury severity (defined as ISS &gt;15) and morality to the trauma database. The transportation database moderately classified mortality (sensitivity = 87.7% [78.2&ndash;93.4%], specificity = 99.5% [98.4&ndash;99.9%]) and poorly classified severe injuries (sensitivity = 63.4% [55.8&ndash;70.4%], specificity = 63.4% [57.7&ndash;68.9%]).

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Pedestrians struck at a SC had lower ISS and mortality compared to those at a NSC.&nbsp;The transportation database had poor correlation with actual injury severity.&nbsp; These findings demonstrate the shortcomings of transportation data alone for accurately classifying injury severity. Database integration can be used for evidence-based action-plans to reduce pedestrian morbidity and death, such as increasing the number of signaled crossings.

Smith<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Emory University School Of Medicine,Atlanta, GA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;

Food Insecurity&nbsp;(FI)&nbsp;has been defined as a lack of consistent access to enough food for a healthy active lifestyle, which includes&nbsp;a lack of available access through transportation or through lack of available financial resources. Currently, 12.7% of the United States are suffering from FI, which has&nbsp;been&nbsp;correlated&nbsp;with an&nbsp;increase&nbsp;hospital costs and poorer health outcomes. To address FI, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released an&nbsp;18-item&nbsp;survey to&nbsp;determine&nbsp;whether a person was considered food insecure. Further&nbsp;studies&nbsp;showed&nbsp;that&nbsp;the first&nbsp;two items&nbsp;of this survey&nbsp;were&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;to&nbsp;determine food insecurity.&nbsp;Currently, limited data&nbsp;exists&nbsp;examining the&nbsp;relationship between trauma populations and FI despite both having similar root causes.&nbsp;We&nbsp;sought&nbsp;to determine this and&nbsp;validate&nbsp;a screening tool for FI in this population.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A cross-sectional survey study of general and orthopedic trauma patients was conducted at a single, Level 1 trauma center in Atlanta, Georgia from September 2019 to February 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;Survey questions included The Hunger Vital&nbsp;SignTM, the first two items of the Core Food Security Module. Positive response to either question was regarded as food insecure. Zip codes were used to determine FI, defined by the USDA Food Access Research Atlas as low-income and low access (LILA) to a supermarket and this was compared to individual participant survey responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Binary classification test metrics were calculated to&nbsp;validate&nbsp;the two items as a screening tool in this population. Additionally, zip codes were used to obtain Distressed Community Indexes (DCI), a marker of community economic wealth.



<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The&nbsp;cohort&nbsp;included 136 patients, of which the majority were African American or Black (n= 82, 60.3%), male (n= 82, 60.3%), General Trauma patients (n= 85, 62.5%) with blunt mechanism of injury (n= 133, 97.8%.)&nbsp;31 respondents affirmed food security&nbsp;(22.8%) despite over half, (n= 70, 51.5%) living in a food insecure community.&nbsp;Half of the&nbsp;cohort&nbsp;lived in a DCI greater than 60 (n= 72, 48.0%) on a scale of 0-100 with &gt;60 being economically at-risk or distressed. The binary classification test metrics calculated for a positive answer to Item 1, to Item 2 and to item 1 or 2&nbsp;combined&nbsp;are displayed in Table 1.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Though the specificity is high, contrary to prior studies involving the&nbsp;general public, this two-item screening tool has a low sensitivity, accuracy, NPV and PPV to determine food insecurity in this single institution trauma population.&nbsp;&nbsp;Community-level statistics suggests that food insecurity is a significant&nbsp;concomitant&nbsp;public problem amongst trauma patients. Prevention efforts should, therefore, aim to address both issues simultaneously. A refined screening tool for FI would be beneficial in this population.

Previous studies describe disparities in pain management by race/ethnicity, and recent work at our institution suggests patient language may also impact treatment. In 2018, we initiated a quality improvement (QI) project to standardize multimodal pain medication regimens for patients undergoing common general surgical procedures. In this study, we identify disparities in discharge opioid prescription patterns based on patient preferred language and show that standardization may help mitigate these differences.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This cross-sectional study included all adult surgical patients at an urban Level-1 Trauma Center and safety-net hospital over a nine-month period from September 2019 to May 2020. Demographic information and discharge prescriptions were extracted from the electronic health record. Opioid quantity was standardized into Oral Morphine Equivalents (OMEs). Patients were considered QI Exposed if they had a procedure targeted by the QI project. We used multivariable regression models to examine the effect of preferred language on total OMEs and daily OMEs prescribed at discharge. Covariates included age, sex, clinical service, inpatient vs. outpatient, and procedure type (trauma, emergency, urgent, or elective).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 3,305 surgical patients included, 67% reported English preferred language (EPL) and 33% reported other preferred languages (OPL). There was no difference in the likelihood of receiving a discharge opioid prescription by preferred language (p=0.514). However, in multivariable analyses adjusting for age, inpatient vs outpatient, and procedure type, OPL patients received 21.3 fewer total OMEs (p&lt;0.001) and 2.1 fewer daily OMEs (p=0.018) compared to EPL patients. Compared to EPL patients, OME differences were largest for Mandarin and Cantonese-speaking OPL patients (Table 1). Race/ethnicity was not a significant predictor of discharge opioid quantity. Adjusted differences in total OMEs by language were significant for both elective (n=1,599, p=0.001) and non-elective (n=1,618, p=0.002) procedures. However, for the subset of patients who were QI Exposed (n=322), there was no adjusted difference in total OMEs by preferred language (difference=7.58 OMEs, p=0.116).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;At our institution, OPL surgical patients are prescribed fewer opioid OMEs at discharge than EPL patients, with heterogeneity across language groups. QI initiatives that increase standardization may have a role in reducing disparities in discharge pain management. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these differences and identify areas for intervention.

Cilley<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,Department Of Surgery,Hershey, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp; Children&rsquo;s hospitals within larger healthcare systems (CHwLS) have the specific clinical advantage of easily facilitated collaboration between adult and children&rsquo;s surgeons. This collaboration, termed Hybrid Surgical Offerings (HSOs), allows for the translation of disease-specific, volume-based experience and innovation from adult providers to pediatric patients.&nbsp; These HSOs are commonly performed in the setting of CHwLS, most frequently when children have disease processes which require interventions that fall outside of the standard practice of children&rsquo;s surgeons.&nbsp; However, programs to improve the quality of such unique care opportunities have not been formally described or evaluated.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp; We sought to identify HSOs within our CHwLS and to identify distinctive components which could help to elevate each service to a programmatic level. Utilizing these components, principles of systems-engineering were then used to develop a standardized model termed the Children&rsquo;s Hybrid Enhanced Surgical Services (CHESS) model which would serve as a guide for assessment and quality improvement of each service. Preliminary validation of this program model was accomplished through interviews of HSO participants and children&rsquo;s hospital leaders. Areas for improved system-wide standardization and programmatic development were identified.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp; We evaluated six of the most common services to provide HSOs at our CHwLS, including the bariatric, minimally invasive, advanced endoscopic, endocrine, thoracic, and orthopedic trauma surgery services.&nbsp; Numerous essential components of HSOs were identified, including quality improvement metrics, credentialing and oversight, care transitions from childhood to adulthood, pediatric family-centered care, maintenance of the cycle of expertise, and scholarship. System wide compliance was noted in areas of care transitions (100%), credentialing (100%), and scholarship (100%). Areas for improvement included maintaining a cycle of expertise (33%), pediatric family-centered care (66%), and uniform quality improvement metrics (50%).&nbsp; Novel advantages of the CHESS model included faster translation of adult innovation to pediatric care and facilitation of emergency interdisciplinary care.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp; Numerous HSOs are available within our CHwLS; however, as identified through use of our preliminary CHESS model, further standardization is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional refining of the model can be performed as more HSOs are identified and evaluated.&nbsp; The CHESS model provides a framework in which to develop, evaluate, and standardize HSOs on a programmatic level and has the potential to drastically improve the quality of these unique collaborative care opportunities at our institution and beyond.&nbsp;

Low-value care contributes to growing health care waste and avoidable patient harms in the United States, which has prompted efforts to de-implement ineffective, unproven, or harmful health care practices. Although motivated in part by the need to cut wasteful spending, de-implementation is also necessitated by an ethical obligation to eliminate health care that is harmful, lacks supporting evidence, or prevents directing resources to more effective interventions. To date, the limited discussion of ethics relevant to de-implementation has focused on the clinical ethics principles of non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy, and justice. What is lacking is an analysis of the ethical principles supporting de-implementation within the broader context of the health care system.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
To better understand the ethical considerations of de-implementation as a health care systems issue, we applied Krubiner and Hyder&rsquo;s bioethical framework for health systems activity. From this framework, we identified ethics principles relevant to de-implementation in that they either called for or facilitated the reduction of low-value care, citing examples of these principles in current surgical practice.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
From a total of 11 conceptual domains proposed by Krubiner and Hyder, we identified 5 health systems ethical principles pertinent to the topic of de-implementation: evidence and effectiveness, transparency and public engagement, equity and empowerment, responsiveness, and collaboration (Table). An analysis through the lens of each of these principles not only supports de-implementation, but also proves an obligation at the health system level to eliminate low-value care. Recognizing the challenge in defining &ldquo;value,&rdquo; the proposed ethical framework may help to increase the legitimacy of the de-implementation process by ensuring value is determined with these principles in mind.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While there is no single ideal ethical framework from which to approach de-implementation of low-vale&nbsp;health care practices, a health systems framework allows consideration of the systems-level factors impacting de-implementation. Framing de-implementation as a health systems issue with ethical implications empowers providers to think about new ways to approach potential roadblocks to the reduction of low-value care.

However, there are few objective studies related to this topic. The aim of this study is to systematically review the effects of EHR usage on provider burnout.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A systematic PRISMA-based literature search was performed. Original research investigating the association between EHR usage and physician burnout was included. Study quality was accessed using Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 296 unique titles identified, 17 met inclusion criteria. The median sample size was 449 (total 87,183). Forty-four percent of the participants were male, 2.1% were not specified. Mean age of the participants was 53 years. Fourteen studies were cross-sectional studies, two were qualitative studies, and one used both methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;For 15 studies with quantitative components, 12 used subjective provider-reported data, while three used objective EHR system generated data.&nbsp;&nbsp;Burnout was assessed subjectively with various validated instruments. Insufficient time for documentation (odds ratio [OR] 1.98-2.81, P&lt;0.001), EHR usage after hours (OR 1.46-2.9, P&lt;0.05), and in-box message volume (OR 2.06, P&lt;0.001) were the&nbsp;three most cited EHR-related factors associated with high burnout.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;There are few studies that objectively assess the relationship between EHR use and provider burnout.

Ryan<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan,Medical School,Ann Arbor, MI, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Michigan,School Of Public Health,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented the voluntary Bundled Payments for Care Improvement-Advanced program (BCPI-A) in 2018. Participating hospitals receive shared savings or are subject to penalties if their episode spending is below or above target prices set by CMS. The program&rsquo;s current approach may set target prices too high for some hospitals, leading to savings that result from mean reversion in episode spending rather than meaningful practice changes.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;In this study, we compared the predictive accuracy of the current CMS methods of calculating target prices with an empirical Bayes approach designed to mitigate the effects of mean reversion.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Compared to the traditional CMS approach, the empirical Bayes approach resulted in significantly more accurate episode spending predictions for 15 of the 21 clinical episodes examined. For 5 episodes, there was no significant difference between approaches. For 1 episode, the CMS approach outperformed the empirical Bayes approach. Across all episodes, prediction error averaged $7,494 for the empirical Bayes approach versus $8,657 for the current CMS approach. Greater differences in accuracy were observed for surgical conditions and for larger hospitals.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Effective alternative payment programs depend on the ability to determine how much variation in health spending and outcomes is due to variation in quality of care versus factors outside provider control. This is a challenging task because it is difficult to predict healthcare spending with available claims data. Empirical Bayes estimation has the potential to enhance BPCI-A by improving target price setting under the program.

Gehlenborg<sup>2</sup>, G. Brat<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,Boston, MA, USA <sup>2</sup>Harvard Medical School,Department Of Biomedical Informatics,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The preoperative informed consent process represents a key ethical, moral, and legal component of the surgeon-patient relationship but is complicated by the&nbsp;lack of a uniform, consensus standard. Though several surgical risk calculators have emerged, whether these tools improve the informed consent process for surgeons remains unclear and their decision-making utility for patients is limited. To address these limitations, we created a data-driven, Visual Consent Tool (VCT) that leverages design-thinking, visualization, patient preferences, and a patient-centered user interface to facilitate the preoperative informed consent process. We aim&nbsp;to conduct semi-structured interviews with surgeons to obtain their feedback on the tool&rsquo;s potential utility and efficacy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  To better understand surgeons&rsquo; experience obtaining informed consent and learn&nbsp;how our VCT might address the challenges they face, we conducted semi-structured interviews and demonstrated our prototype&nbsp;to obtain surgeons&#39;&nbsp;feedback. We anticipate the participation of 30 academic surgeons across ten surgical subspecialties and multiple tertiary care medical centers. Interviews are transcribed, categorized according to key themes, and analyzed. Surgeons&rsquo; perspectives and feedback will be directly incorporated into the current phase of the design process and future iterations of the VCT will be deployed in a forthcoming pilot study.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Preliminary findings of our study reflect the complexity of surgical care and patient management in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and&nbsp;highlight the dearth of digital tools able to facilitate the provision of virtual care. Initial interviews indicate that surgeons appreciate the mobility of the VCT, its ability to be used for in-person and virtual visits, and its capacity to be used by residents and other members of the&nbsp;patient&rsquo;s care team. Emerging themes include the importance of integrating patient-centered language, graphics, and visualization, and implementing enhancements that allow the tool to be used by patients and caregivers at home as well as alongside their provider in the office or during a telehealth visit.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Design-thinking is often reserved for entrepreneurial or public health spaces and key stakeholders -- patients and their medical providers -- are often excluded from the iterative product design process. Currently, few tools exist which are accessible to both patients and providers and leverage patient-centered language, preferences, or visualization. Our initial findings suggest that our design-centered approach is important to surgeons and a tool accessible by both patients and providers may be a valuable addition to the preoperative consent process.

Knowlton<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Stanford University,Department Of Surgery,Palo Alto, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;General surgical emergencies among cardiac surgery patients are increasingly common. With a large volume of patients undergoing complex cardiac intervention including advanced percutaneous procedures, bypass or aortic surgery, or receiving ventricular assist devices or heart transplants, intra-abdominal complications due to ischemic or septic physiology have been reported. Among a cohort of complex cardiac patients, we sought to characterize the incidence of emergency general surgery as well as define outcomes including mortality, length of stay and in-hospital costs.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We queried the 2016 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for adult patients (&gt;18 years) with diagnosis of complex cardiac disease (post-operative from cardiac surgery or with signs of heart failure). We compared patient demographics, healthcare utilization and costs of those who underwent emergency general surgical operative intervention (GS-OR) (as defined by ICD-10-CM procedure codes) and those who did not (non-GS-OR). Outcomes assessed included mortality, cost of treatment, and inpatient length of stay (LOS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Weighted data are presented to provide national estimates.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Among the 4.9 million adult patients with complex cardiac disease, 72,033 patients (1.5%) underwent general surgery operative intervention.&nbsp;Despite similar demographic and clinical characteristics, mortality was significantly higher in the GS-OR group (vs. non-GS-OR: 11.0% vs 5.1%, p&lt;0.001). Mean LOS was nearly three times longer in the GS-OR group (14.2 vs. 5.8 days, p&lt;0.01) and fewer GS-OR patients had a routine discharge home (31.5% vs. 46.0%, p&lt;0.001). GS-OR patients were more commonly treated at large urban teaching hospitals (65.8% vs 63.3%, p&lt;0.001) and mean costs were also higher in the GS-OR group ($43,886 vs $16,386, p&lt;0.001). In adjusted GS-OR patients had a 2.4 higher odds of mortality (aOR 2.4, p&lt;0.0001). Among GS-OR patients only, cardiac patients with a ventricular assisted device had 3.8 higher odds of mortality (aOR=3.8, p&lt;0.001) if they underwent emergency general surgery.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Emergency general surgery on patients with underlying complex cardiac pathology continues to be associated with high mortality rates, particularly among patients with ventricular assist devices as destination therapy or bridges to transplant. Clinicians should have high index of suspicion for intraabdominal complications and those requiring emergency surgical intervention should be managed by experienced multi-disciplinary teams.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic presented the surgical workforce with unprecedented challenges in both. As the pandemic progresses, and we enter into a more chronic phase, the ability to maintain stability in the home will become increasingly important. We sought to better understand the importance of household support for surgeons by examining the relationship between changes in household support during the pandemic and stress levels.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A multi-institutional telephone survey of all surgeons practicing at five academic surgical institutions was conducted from 5/15-6/5/2020. It included basic demographics, training status, partnership status, household support, and surgeon stress level at the time of survey completion (measured using the validated Stress Numerical Rating Scale-11; scale 0, low, to 10, high). Generalized linear models were used to estimate the relationship between stress level and changes in household support during the pandemic, controlling for potential confounders identified in univariate analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Of 529 surgeons contacted, 337 surveys were completed (response rate 63.7%; 49.3% housestaff, 50.7% faculty). Respondents had a mean age of 39.4 years. The minority (40.6%) were female. Age, training status, partnership status, and having children varied significantly between respondents who did not have support, who had a decrease in household support, and who had no change in household support (p&lt;0.001 for all). See Table 1.&nbsp;After controlling for training status, partnership status, and having children, we found that a decrease in household support was associated with a stress level 0.7 points higher than respondents who did not experience a decrease in support (p=0.034). There was no significant relationship between having no household support and stress level (p=0.314).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The Covid-19 pandemic revealed the tenuous work-life integration that exists for many surgeons. In the same way that advanced practice providers have established a vital role as physician extenders, allowing surgeons to maximize their effectiveness in the workplace, we suggest that household support employees play an analogous, essential role as household extenders. One way in which health systems may be able to maintain the effectiveness of their surgical workforce is to provide logistical support to maintain a stable home environment, for example by providing access to collaborative pooled networks of surgeons with similar household extender needs, flexible onsite daycare, or assistance with homeschooling infrastructure.

Divino<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>The Mount Sinai Hospital,Surgery,New York, NY, USA <sup>2</sup>The Mount Sinai Hospital,Vascular Surgery,New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Antibody titers are used as markers of prior infection and immunogenicity. Seroconversion rates among healthcare providers (HCPs) exposed to COVID-19 are unknown. In this observational quality control study, we aimed to determine antibody prevalence in HCPs deployed by the Department of Surgery to treat COVID-19 patients across the Mount Sinai Health System.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
During March, April and May 2020, 208 surgical HCPs were deployed to treat COVID-19 patients. Electronic health records were reviewed to determine antibody status, which was determined by an in-house serum assay that detects COVID-19-specific IgG antibodies. An anonymous survey was sent to these HCPs to elucidate more details regarding unprotected exposures.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
147 of the 208 (71%) deployed HCPs underwent antibody testing. 35 (31%) tested positive. 99 HCPs (48%) responded to the survey. 93 (94%) HCPs reported consistent n95 compliance. 83 (84%), 91 (92%), 85 (86%), and 77 (78%) reported consistent compliance with face shields, gloves, gowns, and an additional surgical mask, respectively. 49 (49%) reported at least one unprotected exposure. 10 (20%) reported five or more unprotected exposures. PPE shortage was the most commonly cited reason for PPE non-compliance.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
To our knowledge, we are the first to report antibody generation among US healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. Our seropositivity rate was 31%, in contrast to other hospitals in Massachusetts and Washington that have reported a 9-10% infection rate (1-3). The most important explanation for this is that New York had over three and over six times as many cases as Massachusetts and Washington, respectively (4). Other reasons include the universal PPE shortage in New York during the peak of the disease, which was supported by our survey results, and our incomplete knowledge of the pathogenicity of COVID-19. Limitations of our study include 71% of our deployed HCPs being tested for antibodies, 48% survey completion, and the inherent recall bias encountered in survey studies. In summary, COVID-19 antibodies were detected in 31% of the HCPs who were deployed by the Department of Surgery at Mount Sinai to treat COVID-19 developed antibodies. This was likely associated with the universal PPE shortage.&nbsp;

Low-value preoperative care is prevalent despite the limited benefit it provides patients. Eliminating low-value preoperative care presents an important opportunity to improve value in surgery. Recent policy changes at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) now allow facilities and surgeons to determine the need for a preoperative H&amp;P prior to low-risk ambulatory procedures. Despite this policy change, there is little evidence to suggest that these low-value evaluations have been de-implemented. The objective is to&nbsp;identify surgeon preferences, perceived barriers and facilitators to de-implementation of routine preoperative H&amp;Ps before low-risk surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We identified surgeons who perform low-risk surgeries through purposive (gender, specialty) and snowball sampling. We conducted&nbsp;phone interviews using a standardized interview guide developed using the &ldquo;Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases&rdquo; framework. Surgeons were asked about their understanding&nbsp;of the recent CMS policy change, and about their attitudes and current practices relating to preoperative H&amp;Ps. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed anonymously. Thematic coding was used to identify barriers and facilitators to de-implementation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Surgeons expressed a range of preferences regarding routine preoperative H&amp;P for patients undergoing low-risk surgery. The factors considered when planning preoperative care included risk assessment, reimbursement, patient safety, provider autonomy, and patient convenience. Most surgeons believed a preoperative H&amp;P was necessary for patient safety, however some viewed the 30-day timeline as a formality while others considered it a necessity. Some surgeons reported that they would no longer conduct an H&amp;P within the 30-day timeline if the policy were removed. Reported workflow of current preoperative care was variable with some surgeons preferring to conduct their own evaluations and others relying on outside clinics. Surgeons reported that the incentives to deescalate preoperative procedures may include patient convenience, more efficient resource allocation, and decreased provider workload. Reported barriers to de-implementing preoperative H&amp;Ps included concerns of patient safety, malpractice risks, and unexpected changes in patient health status (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study identified variations in preferences regarding routine and comprehensive preoperative H&amp;Ps prior to low-risk, ambulatory surgeries. Using these data, health systems can design strategies to de-implement low-value preoperative care in order to optimize efficiency and value in surgical care.

Pierce<sup>1</sup>, J. A. Sosa<sup>1</sup>, E. C. Wick<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University of California San Francisco,Department Of Surgery,San Francisco, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated healthcare disparities, disproportionally impacting patients already suffering unequal outcomes due to social determinants. To conserve resources and decrease exposures, practices and hospitals have limited elective surgeries, leading to triage based on clinical prioritization. The impact of the pandemic and elective surgery triage on access to surgical care is unknown. This study examined access to elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, with attention to disparities, at two key logistical points: case request and case scheduling.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We analyzed adult non-emergency case requests at an academic institution where case triage began on 3/9/20; surgeons were newly required to prioritize cases (low/normal/high, based on CMS Tiers 1-3) with service-specific guidelines. We compared patients in the COVID era (3/9-8/2/20, date of data extraction) vs control era (3/9-8/2/19). Zip code distance was calculated with R package ZipRadius. We used logistic regression to study predictors of failure to progress from case request to scheduling during the COVID era.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Elective case requests decreased 27% from control (n=16,007) to COVID era (n=11,623). Ophthalmology requests decreased the most (37%); cardiac surgery requests the least (11%). Overall, mean patient age was 52 years in both eras; proportion of female patients decreased (53.8% to 52.6%, p=0.17); non-white race/ethnicity increased (42.8% to 43.3%, p=0.39). Limited English proficiency significantly decreased from n=1,424 to 947 (8.9% to 8.1%, p=0.03); public insurance significantly decreased from n=10,103 to 7,135 (63.1% to 61.4%, p&lt;0.01); patients living &gt;100 miles away significantly decreased from n=5,635 to 3,768 (35.2% to 32.4%, p&lt;0.001). In the COVID era, 21% of case requests failed to be scheduled; Table 1 shows adjusted odds ratios (aORs). Non-white ethnicity and public insurance trended toward increased aOR of scheduling failure; older age trended toward decreased aOR of scheduling failure; as expected, normal/low priority significantly increased aOR of scheduling failure. In subgroup analyses, only priority was consistently significant. In high priority cases, non-white ethnicity trended toward increased aOR of scheduling failure.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The COVID-19 pandemic led to disproportionately fewer case requests for patients with limited English proficiency, public insurance, or &gt;100-mile distance to our center. In patients with case requests, only surgeon-reported priority significantly predicted failure to schedule, with a trend toward increased scheduling failure in patients with non-white ethnicity or public insurance. Understanding these disparities is urgently needed for surgeons to address them.

In this study we investigate characteristics of surgeons who hold a high number of surgical patents and evaluate the association between the number of patents held, publications, and revenue received from medical device companies.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The 2019 list of Fellows of the American College of Surgeons (FACS) was cross-indexed with the US Patent and Trademark Office from 1993-2018. Surgical patents were defined based on Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) code, selecting for codes related to surgical devices, implantables, dressings, and introducers. The top 1% of patent-holding surgeons were identified. Specialty, gender, academic rank, executive title, number of publications, total NIH funding, and total payments were collected. Payments included &ldquo;general payments&rdquo; from drug and medical device companies as defined by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Open Payments program between 2013 and 2019. Correlations between the number of patents, academic publications, and total payments were calculated using spearman&#39;s ranked test. Data was compared to a previously presented cohort that included all FACS patent holders.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;2164 FACS surgeons were identified as holding one or more patents (median 2). 25 surgeons ranked in the top 1% with respect to total number of patents held (median 31; range 25-346). These surgeons hold 16% of total surgeon-held patents. Within the larger FACS cohort, 36% of patent holders are general surgeons, whereas among the top 1% of patent holders 96% are subspecialists. The top 3 specialties were orthopedic surgery (20%), cardiothoracic surgery (16%), and neurosurgery (16%). 96% were male, compared to 98% of the FACS cohort. 15 surgeons were publicly listed as founders/CEOs/CMOs of a medical device company. 10 had no academic affiliation. The median number of publications was 49 (range 0-796). 7 had NIH funding ranging from $22K-$8.1M. The median total payments received was $54K (range $0-$106M), for a total of $218M, of which 96% were royalties (Figure 1). There was a moderate positive correlation between the number of patents held and payments received (r=0.4, p=0.049). There was no correlation between the number of patents and number of publications (p=0.18).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The number of patents has been proposed as a metric of academic surgical innovation success. Surgeons with the highest number of surgical patents are largely characterized as subspecialists with executive company involvement, mixed academic productivity, and high royalty payments. An understanding of these highly successful surgeon innovators may help define pathways for surgeons interested in a career in innovation.

Ratings websites offer consumers the ability to compare products and services easily. Patient reviews/recommendations of hospitals are unsolicited and less structured compared to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) surveys. Here, we evaluated ratings on 3 widely used consumer ratings websites, HCAHPS scores, and their correlation with patient safety in a national cohort of academic medical centers.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We identified 356 US acute care teaching hospitals that sent 5,000-10,000 HCAHPS surveys in 2018, representing medium to large-sized centers. We collected patient satisfaction results for each hospital (based on the &ldquo;Would you recommend&rdquo; question) and post-surgical patient safety indicators (PSIs) from the publically available Hospital Compare website. We also collected hospital star ratings (1&ndash;5) from Facebook (n=281 hospitals; mean 375 reviews/hospital), Google (n=354; mean 326 reviews/hospital), and Yelp (n=295; mean 82 reviews/hospital). Differences in ratings were compared with paired t-tests. Concordance between ratings websites, HCHAPS scores, and a composite PSI were assessed with Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Mean Facebook ratings (3.8, IQR 3.6-4.1) were higher than those found on Google (3.2, IQR 2.7-3.5) or Yelp (2.5, IQR 2.0-3.1), with statistically significant pairwise comparisons (p&lt;0.001). &nbsp;Each exhibited positive correlation with the HCAHPS &ldquo;Recommend Hospital&rdquo; score (p&lt;0.001). Yelp correlation strength (r = 0.54) was higher than Google (r = 0.51) and Facebook (r = 0.45). A linear regression model further demonstrated that Yelp (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.29) was more strongly correlated with HCAHPS than Google (r<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.26) or Facebook (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.20) (Figure). No consumer-driven ratings platform exhibited correlation with the composite post-surgical PSI.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
There appears to be wide variation between platforms in consumer ratings of hospitals, and ratings on Facebook are significantly more favorable than on Google or Yelp. These are independently correlated with HCAHPS scores. While the ratings may be informed by different variables, these findings suggest that unstructured consumer reviews generally reflect similar directionality as HCAHPS satisfaction scores, particularly patients&rsquo; willingness to recommend the hospital to others. It is not clear why Yelp reviews are less favorable, but the difference across platforms may be important for users to consider. Further, the consumer ratings platforms are not correlated with the composite post-surgical PSI, so online ratings may not reflect the safety of surgical care received.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We conducted a vignette-based cross-sectional survey of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) attendings, NICU fellows, NICU nurse practitioners and bedside nurses and pediatric surgery attendings.&nbsp; The survey consisted of four vignettes with the following surgical management strategies: 1) sutureless primary closure, 2) spring silo placement and serial reduction, 3) handsewn silo placement and serial reduction, and 4) sutured primary closure. Providers were asked to rate their impression of the infant&rsquo;s pain experience on a Likert scale (0 no pain, 5 excruciating pain) and pain management recommendation at specific times during the treatment course.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fischer&rsquo;s exact test and Fleiss&rsquo; kappa were performed to assess the association and inter-group agreement on medications administered and perception of pain.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Ninety-six of 380 electronically distributed surveys (25.3%) were completed, with response rates of 73.3% (11/16) for NICU attending physicians, 60% (6/10) for NICU fellows, 65.2% (15/23) for NICU nurse practitioners, 17.3% (56/324) for NICU registered nurses, and 100% (8/8) for pediatric surgeons. For each clinical vignette, there was poor agreement (k&lt;0) among all providers regarding the perception of pain, and there was significant variation in the perception of pain between provider types for each of the vignettes (Figure 1). Overall, morphine was the most commonly recommended pain management, followed by acetaminophen, but there was no significant difference in the pain management (opioid vs. non-opioid vs. no pain medication) recommended for all clinical vignettes.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;There is a lack of agreement among providers&rsquo; perceptions of pain experienced by gastroschisis patients; however, there was no significant difference in the type of medication recommended for pain management.&nbsp; A standardized perioperative pain management protocol may be beneficial in this patient population.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review was performed from June 2013 - July 2019 at a tertiary medical center. Twenty five patients with recurrent cystine stones were randomly matched by age, gender, and procedure to 25 recurrent non-cystine and 25 first time non-cystine stone formers. Patients underwent ureteroscopic stone removal and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Procedural opioid utilization and the amount prescribed at discharge was determined by medical record review. Opioids prescribed over this time span was determined by a query of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data base. Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) was used to standardize opioid utilization.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Mean intraoperative opioid use over this 6 year period (17.6 MME) and during hospitalization (47.8 MME) was similar among all cohorts.&nbsp; Opioids prescribed at discharge significantly decreased (mean MME &plusmn; SD), 216.8 &plusmn;&nbsp; 125.9 for 2013-2016 and 124.2 &plusmn; 106.1 for &plusmn; 2017-2019 ( p&lt;0.001). Over this 6 year period, there were no differences in the number of discrete opioid prescribers between the 3 cohorts, mean 7.9.&nbsp; Opioids prescribed within 180 days of stone removal was similar amongst all 3 cohorts, mean 3377.6 MME/patient.&nbsp; Over this 6 year time period there was no difference in total&nbsp; amount of opioids prescribed for each cohort, mean 27,987.8 MME.&nbsp; Mean MME prescribed over the 6 years for the 45 who were opioid non-naive at initial stone removal was higher than the naive cohort, 45,783 &plusmn; 123,702 versus 1,295&plusmn; 2,611 (mean &plusmn; SD), approaching statistical significance, p=0.059. The majority of prescriptions (56.4%) and MME prescribed (91.9 %) were from pain management and primary care providers.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: MME prescribed for stone removal in an environment of high utilization has not declined and is not influenced by stone disease complexity. Prior opioid exposure had an impact. An opioid stewardship program resulted in decreased opioids prescribed by the surgeons conducting stone removal but had a negligible overall influence.&nbsp; The latter is driven by other care providers.

The resumption of procedures requires strategic considerations that account for ongoing demand as well as the backlog of patients who were unable to undergo surgery. It is critical to understand the impact that elective surgery cancellations will have on hospitals&rsquo; financial solvency and ability to provide quality care. We sought to quantify the financial impact of elective surgery cancellations during the pandemic, simulate hospitals&rsquo; recovery times, and understand the implications of the CARES Act on hospital solvency.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Elective surgical cases were abstracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2016-2017). Time series were utilized to forecast March-May 2020 revenues and demand. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to calculate the time to clear backlog cases and match expected ongoing demand in the post-COVID period. Variables included pre-COVID capacity utilization, post-COVID starting utilization, and utilization growth rate. Subset analyses were performed by hospital region and teaching status. Given the intent of the CARES Act, results were interpreted in the context of specified hospital support.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
National revenue loss due to elective surgery cessation was estimated to be $22.3 billion (B). Recovery to market equilibrium was conserved across strata and influenced by pre- and post-COVID capacity utilization. Median recovery time was 12-22 months across all strata. Lower pre-COVID utilization was associated with fewer months to recovery. The benefit of a greater post-COVID monthly growth rate was diminished if post-COVID starting utilization rates were higher than baseline pre-COVID utilization rates.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Strategies to mitigate the predicted revenue loss of $22.3B due to elective surgery cessation will vary with hospital-specific supply-demand equilibrium. One response to the threat of financial insolvency has been to furlough medical workers but this strategy may portend greater risk in the long run. If patient demand is slow to return, hospitals should focus on patient recruitment. Rather than reducing operations and furloughing workers, aggressively pursuing marketing, investment, and patient recruitment opportunities may reduce health system risk, particularly as the handicap of pandemic-related losses is likely proportional regardless of hospital type and region. In contrast, if hospital capacity is constrained, efficient capacity expansion such as by hiring additional staff, scheduling cases on nights and weekends, pursuing mergers/acquisitions, and accelerating infrastructure investments may be beneficial. Finally, the CARES Act may inadequately buffer losses observed by rural and urban non-teaching hospitals, increase these institutions&rsquo; financial risk, and exacerbate care disparities.

Reddy<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan,Medical School,Ann Arbor, MI, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Michigan,Department Of Surgery,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) have higher rates of negative health outcomes. Medical interpreters help ensure accurate understanding of informed consent, perioperative management, and discharge instructions; however, they are frequently underutilized even when available. We hypothesized that more senior physicians or those with greater foreign language exposure would use interpreter services more consistently.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted a survey of surgeons (trainees and faculty) from a single academic hospital.&nbsp;Participants were surveyed on&nbsp;their proficiency in languages, their annual need/use of medical interpreters, and barriers, if any, to using interpreters. Data were analyzed using Excel and SPSS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The response rate was 12.8% (97/755), with 54% being female, including 32 residents and 55 faculty (56%). Respondents interacted with LEP patients across a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings. Participants estimated a mean 16.33 annual encounters with LEP patients (SD 16.6). One-third of providers reported needing an interpreter more frequently than they actually used one, citing an average underutilization of eight encounters per year. There was a trend of faculty being more likely to use interpreter services consistently (p=0.0502).&nbsp;There was no correlation between proficiency in other languages and interpreter use (p=0.26). Providers who underutilized interpreter services more commonly listed patient preference for an ad-hoc interpreter (i.e. family or friend) as a major reason for underutilizing hospital interpreter services. Overall, the most common barriers were the wait time for an available interpreter and provider preference to avoid using a phone or video interpreter if in-person services were unavailable.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
One-third of surgical providers surveyed reported underutilization of interpreter services for their LEP patients despite acknowledging their benefit. Even among providers reporting adequate utilization,&nbsp;time constraints were commonly cited as a major deterrent. In addition, many defer to their patients&rsquo; preferences to have a family member or friend interpret. This&nbsp;may have an unintended effect&nbsp;on&nbsp;interpretation accuracy and legality, which could&nbsp;lead to clinically important&nbsp;ramifications for both patient comprehension and provider liability.

Molecular diagnostic tests had a $9.9b market share in 2018, primarily comprised of infectious disease and genetic testing, but the development of advanced cancer diagnostic tests is projected to increase more rapidly than other market segments. While diagnostic tests do show benefits, including reducing unnecessary surgeries and hospitalizations, these benefits can be overstated with failure to account for inherent biases. As a result, the actual clinical validity of diagnostic tests may differ from reported values, indicating flawed guidance in decision making. We aimed to review and quantify the biases within validation studies of the commercially available molecular tests (MT) primarily used to evaluate cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify relevant articles. Studies which reported sensitivity, specificity, PPV, or NPV of diagnostic MTs were included. These statistics were extracted, and if necessary and where possible, calculated. Reviews and validations of non-commercial gene panels were excluded. Sources of bias in the validation process were identified via examination of the study methods. The PRISMA Preferred Reporting Items checklist (2009) guided the review process.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Forty-five articles were assessed for adherence to 12 criteria meant to ascertain bias in patient selection, MT ordering and interpretation, and clinical context. Commercial MTs assessed included Afirma&reg; Gene Expression Classifier (N=32 studies), Afirma&reg; Genomic Sequencing Classifier (N=5), Afirma&reg; Xpression Atlas (N=1), ThyroSeq&reg; versions 1-3 (N=12), miRinform&reg; (N=2), Quest Diagnostics&reg; (N=1), RosettaGx Reveal&reg; (N=2), and ThyraMIR&reg; (N=1). Nine studies compared two MTs, and one study compared three. Studies included a median of 132 patients (range: 22-563).

Of the articles assessed, 73% (33/45) reported exclusion criteria, 22% (10/45) reported pathology evaluation blinded to MT result, and 38% reported nondiagnostic MT results in their analysis. A weighted average of 57% of nodule diagnoses were verified via index test.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
There is room for improvement in the reporting quality and in addressing methodological biases in clinical validation studies of molecular tests. We find high rates of potential selection, diagnostic review, and partial verification biases. Ethical concerns bar the universal verification of test results; therefore, future directions of this research include developing statistical methods to account for these biases and modeling clinical impacts of the advent of molecular testing for indeterminate thyroid nodules.

For each search, the search results were limited to the first 10 returns. Five social medial platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube) were investigated for professional accounts, as were the presence of a non-institutional professional website, an active Healthgrades account (as determined by the presence of a care philosophy), and presence in YouTube videos uploaded by a party other than the surgeon. A PIP score was calculated for each surgeon by assigning a point to a professional presence on any of the eight platforms. Professional accounts were differentiated from personal accounts by the presence of medical degrees/titles and practice information. Univariate analyses and unpaired two-sample t-tests with equal variances were conducted to describe PIP scores and estimate the relationship between surgeon characteristics and PIP score.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;407 endocrine surgeons were studied, of whom 171 (42.0%) were female. There were 255 (62.7%) academic and 152 (37.3%) community-based endocrine surgeons. LinkedIn accounts were most common (n=216), followed by YouTube videos uploaded by a third party (n=178), Twitter accounts (n=107), active Healthgrades accounts (n=69), Facebook accounts (n=17), non-institutional professional websites (n=10), Instagram accounts (n=3), and YouTube accounts (n=3). PIP scores ranged from 0 to 5, with a median of 1 and mean of 1.48 (standard deviation 1.18) accounts. The mean PIP score for academic surgeons was significantly higher than community-based surgeons (1.62 &plusmn; 0.07 vs. 1.24 &plusmn; 0.10, p&lt;0.01). There was no significant difference in mean PIP score between men and women.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Self-identified endocrine surgeons practicing in the United States have low utilization of a professional internet presence. Because many patients use social media, professional ratings websites, or other web-based tools to identify physicians, endocrine surgeons may consider bolstering their professional internet presence to attract patients.

Schneider<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health,Department Of Surgery, Division Of Endocrine Surgery,Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Thyroid nodules are remarkably common - nearly two-thirds of US adults will show nodules on high-quality ultrasound, and 95% of these nodules are benign. However, a false negative diagnosis delays cancer treatment and can be psychologically devastating to patient and provider. The purpose of this study is to develop a predictive model using machine learning which can identify falsely benign thyroid nodule biopsies based on available clinical data.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We conducted a retrospective medical record review at one academic and one community center. ICD-9 codes identified patients with thyroid nodular disease; clinical information and notes were extracted from the electronic health record. Included patients were those with thyroid nodules evaluated by ultrasound, having received Bethesda II (benign) diagnosis following fine needle aspiration. We previously developed and validated natural language processing systems to extract nodule features from text cytology, ultrasound, and pathology reports. Features included nodule size, ultrasound features and TSH levels, along with demographic data such as age and biological sex. A nodule was considered benign if either all pathology reports were benign or all follow-up cytology reports were benign. Missing values were imputed using a Random Forest based iterative method (missingpy, Python 3.8). Tree-based, rule-based, and Bayesian models were generated with WEKA 3.8.4 using 10-fold cross validation and tested for predictive accuracy. Hyperparameter selection was accomplished using an automated iterative approach to maximize model specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 579 subjects met inclusion criteria; 1.7% were ultimately diagnosed with cancer. Of all algorithms tested, a Random Forest method was able to achieve the best AUC ROC (0.949, Table 1) when predicting nodules as either cancerous or benign. Random Forest was also most effective at minimizing false positives when detecting cancer (Cancer True Positive Rate = 0.100, Cancer False Positive Rate = 0.000).
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Machine learning can accurately identify falsely benign thyroid nodules. A Random Forest model performed well using readily available data obtained via standard evaluation of thyroid nodules. Importantly, the model minimized false positives as this would be crucial for clinical applications. Future studies will prospectively evaluate the model&rsquo;s performance.

Miller School of Medicine,Division Of Endocrine Surgery; DeWitt Daughtry Family Department Of Surgery,Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) being the most common type. PTC is three times more common in women than in men. Despite this sex disparity in the incidence of PTC, the differences in clinical presentation between sexes remain unclear. Although generally thought to have a good prognosis, thyroid cancer in men appears associated with poorer outcomes than in women. This study compares the clinical presentation and pathologic features of men and women with PTC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective review of prospectively collected data for 1854 patients who underwent FNA of a solitary thyroid nodule and thyroidectomy between January 2010 and June 2020 at a single institution was performed. Of the entire group, there were 851 patients with PTC. Patients with benign thyroid disease and other thyroid carcinoma types were excluded. Factors including age, ultrasound features, FNA results, extent of surgical operation and final histopathology were then compared between male and female patients with PTC. Advanced features on final histopathology included extrathyroidal extension (ETE), lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and lymph node (LN) positivity. Descriptive statistics using chi-square and t-test statistics were performed to compare outcomes by sex.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 1854 patients who underwent thyroidectomy, there were 851 (46%) patients with PTC of which 158 (19%) were men and 693 (81%) were women. Mean age of patients was 48 &plusmn; 14 years, and most were of Hispanic origin (n=579, 68%). Men had a significantly higher rate of radiation exposure relative to women (n=13, 8% vs. n=14, 2%, p&lt;0.01). There were no ultrasonographic or FNA cytologic differences among sexes. Overall, 792 (85%) patients were treated with total thyroidectomy. However, thyroid lobectomy was more commonly performed among men compared to women (n= 38, 24% vs. n= 90, 13%, p&lt;0.01). Men more commonly had aggressive pathologic features including ETE (n=36, 23% vs. n=118, 17%, p=0.10), LVI (n=74, 47% vs. n=236, 34%, p&lt;0.01), and positive LN (n=73, 46% vs. n=249, 36%, p=0.07) compared to women.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;More men than women with PTC have higher rates of radiation exposure and advanced features on final histopathology including ETE, LVI and LN positivity. Despite having similar sonographic and cytologic findings as women, men with PTC have more advanced disease at time of presentation that may explain their worse prognosis. Earlier and more vigilant screening of men to detect thyroid cancer might improve clinical outcomes.

There is limited research on the presentation and outcomes of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in the United States (US) Hispanic population, though socioeconomic status and ethnicity have been associated with disparities in diagnosis and treatment. We aimed to explore the disease burden of PTC in a predominantly Hispanic community at the US-Mexico border.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A single-institution retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with PTC from November 2010-July 2019 was conducted. Medical records of patients who underwent thyroidectomy were screened; inclusion criteria were adult (18+) patients and PTC confirmed by surgical pathology including microcarcinomas (&lt;1cm) cases. We excluded pediatric and non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillary-like nuclear features cases. Oncologic stage was determined using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) edition manual. Independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests were performed to test differences between groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

One-thousand four-hundred fifty-four patients underwent thyroid surgery in the study period, of which 418 (28.8%) had PTC and 412 (28.3%) met inclusion criteria. Most patients were female (n=355, 86.2%) or Hispanic (n=369, 89.6%). The mean age at surgery was 50.4 years (range 18-86). Most patients presented before age 55 (59.0%); though women were diagnosed earlier than men (50.0 vs 53.5 y: p = 0.1295) as were Hispanic patients in comparison to non-Hispanic patients (49.1 vs 61.6: p &lt; 0.0001) The majority of patients presented at AJCC stage I (n=305, 74.0%) or II (n=23, 5.6%) PTC, however, there was no difference in stage at presentation for Hispanics and Non-Hispanics.&nbsp; The average size of the tumors was 1.53 cm (range 0.1-8) with 184 patients (44.7%) having microcarcinomas. The size of PTC was larger for Hispanic than non-Hispanic patients (mean: 1.54 cm vs 1.35 cm; p = 0.3875), but the difference was not statistically significant. Central/level 6 or lateral neck lymphadenectomy was only performed in 161 patients (39.1%) and 92 more patients (22.3%) had incidental lymph nodes sampled. Thirty-nine patients (9.5%) had lateral neck disease. Nearly all patients ultimately underwent total thyroidectomy (TT) (n=395, 95.9%), including initial total thyroidectomy (n=310, 75.2%), thyroid lobectomy with immediate completion thyroidectomy (n=45, 40.2%), and staged completion thyroidectomy (n=40, 9.7%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

This largely Hispanic patient population with PTC had similar stage disease as the general US population. Nearly all patients underwent TT, which may represent prior American Thyroid Association recommendations for TT in all PTC &gt;1cm, yet central neck lymphadenectomy was not routinely performed. Therefore, lymph node metastasis of PTC may not be adequately captured. Further research needs to be conducted to better understand the disease burden, surgical management, and outcomes of PTC within the US Hispanic population.

Telemedicine has become a key option to continue to health care delivery in the wake of COVID-19. &nbsp;Little data exists on the patient perspective of its use- particularly those of endocrine surgery patients&mdash;or that of providers. The aim of the study was to assess endocrine surgery patients&rsquo; attitudes about telemedicine and how the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced them, and to compare that to the perspectives of referring endocrinologists.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients seen in the office from a regional endocrine surgery practice&nbsp;between March 1, 2019 and February 1, 2020 were mailed surveys about their perspectives on the use of telemedicine.&nbsp; Referring endocrinologists were emailed a link to survey in April 2020. All surveys were anonymous.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

32 patients responded (response rate 6.5%).&nbsp; The average age was 60.1; 81% were female; 41% were Black.&nbsp; Most either used (81%) or were willing to try (91%) telemedicine.&nbsp; Nearly all (93.7%) were either very comfortable or somewhat comfortable with new technology. 90.0% of the respondents had regular and easy access to the internet and a computer. Only 33.3% believed the assessment via telemedicine was as good as an in-person visit. Convenience (78.1%) and technological availability (56.3%) were the most cited reasons to try telemedicine; quality of care (46.9%) and personal connection (53.1%) were the most cited reasons for not wanting to try it. 68.8% said COVID-19 made them more likely to use telemedicine, 6.3% were less likely; and 25.0% were not affected.&nbsp; Patients preferred telemedicine for follow-up visits to review normal results (84.4%) and pre-existing problems (75.0%), but not for new consultations (56.3%), follow -up visits to review abnormal results (53.1%) or a new problem (53.3%). Almost all (93.3%) would want to meet the surgeon before surgery. &nbsp;Responses did not vary by age or race (p&gt;0.05).
Sixteen referring endocrinologists responded (response rate 6.4%).&nbsp; The average age was 52.4; 62.5% were female.&nbsp; About half (56.3%) had used telemedicine before and 50% were very comfortable with technology.&nbsp; They cited convenience (62.5%) and technological availability (18.8%) as the main reasons to use it, and quality of care (26.7%) and personal connection (20%) as mains reasons not to.&nbsp; 37.5% thought virtual visits were as good as in-person ones.&nbsp; They would be interested in telemedicine for follow-up of normal (93%), abnormal (81%) tests, and chronic conditions (81%), but not for new visits (87.5%).&nbsp; Over two thirds reported that meeting the surgeon in-person preoperatively was important or very important.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Telemedicine is a mutually acceptable method for patients and their providers for endocrine surgery delivery, although in-person visits continue to have their place. &nbsp;Telemedicine use may continue to expand after the pandemic as an important point of access for endocrine surgery.

Fazendin<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (tHPT) is caused by unregulated parathyroid function, which develops after longstanding secondary hyperparathyroidism. Subtotal parathyroidectomy with 4-gland exploration is required to achieve surgical cure. While some surgeons advocate for pre-operative localization with sestamibi to detect ectopic glands, many do not. Therefore, we review our experience with use of preoperative imaging in tHPT.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for tHPT between 2001 and 2019. Patient demographics, preoperative and postoperative calcium and parathyroid hormone levels, radiology reports, clinical notes and operative notes, and pathology were reviewed. Preoperative imaging was compared with intraoperative findings and pathology results. The primary outcome was cure of tHPT, defined as normal calcium level at 6-months postoperatively.&nbsp;&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We included 220 patients with a mean age of 52&plusmn;11, the majority of which were male (56%). Preoperative mean calcium and PTH levels were 10.6&plusmn;1.1 mg/dl and 350&plusmn;400 pg/ml, respectively. The two most common preoperative symptoms were bone disease (44%) and fatigue (33%). A minority of patients (22.7%) underwent preoperative imaging (15.9% sestamibi vs 10.0% ultrasound versus 3.2% both sestamibi and ultrasound). In this study, 57 (26%) patients had ectopic glands, with the most common sites in the thymus (66.7%) and thyroid gland (21.1%). The surgeons located 79% intraoperatively, without preoperative imaging. The reoperation rate for ectopic glands in the study population was 5.0% (n=11), and among these patients, 9 (80%) were localized on imaging prior to the re-operation. 99% patients in this study achieved normal calcium at 6-month follow-up.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Most ectopic glands were successfully identified by surgeons during the operation without preoperative imaging. The reoperation rate due to ectopic

glands was low. Routine pre-operative Tc-99m-sestamibi scan in patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism is not necessary for localization of parathyroid glands.

Kuo<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Temple University,Department Of Surgery,Philadelpha, PA, USA <sup>2</sup>Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University,Department Of Surgery,Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Patients frequently use online physician ratings websites (PRWs) to identify physicians for care. PRWs provide basic physician information and publish anonymous patient reviews and patient ratings. However, the accuracy of PRWs is uncertain. We investigated the accuracy of Healthgrades.com, the most commonly used PRW, regarding reported board certification of endocrine surgeons in one metropolitan area, and identified predictors of high ratings and a greater number of ratings.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Data was collected from the website www.healthgrades.com in July 2020. The search term &ldquo;endocrine surgery specialist&rdquo; was used and the search was limited to a 25-mile radius around Philadelphia, PA. For each search result, data was collected on physician sex, board certifications, specialty, number of ratings, average rating, if comments were responded to, and if a self-description was provided by the physician. Descriptive statistics were performed to examine surgeon characteristics, Healthgrades ratings, and reported board certification. Board certification was confirmed via search with the corresponding American Board website. Accuracy of the Healthgrades board certification was noted. A kappa statistic was calculated to measure the accuracy of the Healthgrades website. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of board certification accuracy, higher than median number of ratings, and of higher than average ratings.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 300 physicians were identified using the search criteria. The cohort median age was 57.5 (interquartile range IQR 46.5-68.5), and 77% were men. Of the 300 physicians, 290 (97%) were otolaryngologists, 1 (0.33%) was a general surgery-trained endocrine surgeon, 4 (1.3%) were general surgery-trained physicians of other specialties (1 general surgery, 1 transplant surgery, and 2 breast surgery), and 3 (1.0%) were plastic surgeons. Of the 309 board certifications amongst the 300 physicians, 260 (87%) were accurately reported on Healthgrades; the kappa statistic for accurate board certification was 0.634. Logistic regression identified providing a self description as a predictor of inaccuracy. The median number of ratings was 4 (IQR 0-13). Provision of a self-description on the Healthgrades page was predictive of a higher number of ratings. The mean &ldquo;average rating&rdquo; was 4.0. Surgeon response to patient comments was predictive of higher-than-average patient ratings.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
A wide range of surgeon types are identified as endocrine surgery specialists by the most commonly used PRW. The reliability of the Healthgrades.com board certification reporting was moderate. Increased surgeon involvement with the Healthgrades site was predictive of a higher number of ratings and higher average ratings but lower accuracy.

Whang<sup>1</sup>, N. Cho<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Brigham And Women's Hospital,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury is a significant complication after thyroidectomy. Understanding risk factors for RLN injury and the associated postoperative complications may help inform quality improvement initiatives.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) thyroidectomy-targeted database was utilized for patients undergoing total thyroidectomy between 2016-2017. Univariable and multivariable regression were used to identify factors associated with RLN injury with an emphasis on use of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 6538 patients were identified. The overall rate of RLN injury was 7.1% (467/6538). Of these, 4129 (63.1%) patients had IONM, with an associated&nbsp; RLN injury rate of 6.5% (versus 8.2% without). African American and Asian race, parathyroid auto-transplantation, and lack of RLN monitoring were all significantly associated with nerve injury on multivariable analysis (p&lt;0.05). Patients with RLN injury were more likely to experience cardiopulmonary complications, reintubation, longer length of stay, readmission, and reoperation. Patients who had IONM and sustained RLN injury remained at risk for developing significant postoperative complications, although the extent of cardiopulmonary complications was less severe in this cohort.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;RLN injury is common after thyroidectomy and is associated with significant morbidity, despite best practices. Attention to preoperative characteristics may help clinicians further risk stratify patients prior to thyroidectomy. While IONM does not mitigate all complications, use of this technology may decrease severity of postoperative complications.&nbsp;

It is unknown if this training paradigm has resulted in changes in attending practice. This study examines trends in the performance of cervical endocrine procedures by surgical subspecialty nationally over the past 12 years.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Thyroid and parathyroid surgeries were identified from the 2007-2018 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant User File (NSQIP-PUF) &nbsp;using CPT codes. The NSQIP targeted thyroidectomy database from 2016-2018 was analyzed for specific patient outcomes related to thyroidectomy including hypocalcemia, laryngeal nerve dysfunction, and neck hematoma.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The total number of thyroid and parathyroid surgeries abstracted into NSQIP, performed by both general surgeons and otolaryngologists increased from 2007 to 2018. However, the percentage of total surgeries performed by general surgeons decreased from 96.18% in 2007 to 56.72% in 2018 for thyroid surgeries, 98.37% in 2007 to 78.99 % in 2018 for parathyroid surgeries. From 2016-2018 targeted thyroidectomy NSQIP database, thyroidectomies performed by general surgeons were associated with an incidence of laryngeal nerve dysfunction of 6.6% compared to 5.6% for thyroidectomies performed by otolaryngologists (P=0.007). The incidence of hypocalcemia within 30 days of discharge was 6.7% for the general surgeon group and 5.9% for the otolaryngology group (p=0.030). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of hypocalcemia prior to discharge (4.3% vs 4.5%, p=0.458), clinically significant hypocalcemia (4.2% vs 3.9%, p=0.307), or neck hematoma/bleeding (1.9% vs 1.8%, p=0.650).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Among NSQIP participating hospitals, an increasing percentage of thyroid and parathyroid surgeries are performed by otolaryngologists.

Divino<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,General Surgery,New York, NEW YORK, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;For patients with carcinoid tumors, surgery can be potentially curative and significantly reduce carcinoid syndrome symptoms. However, recurrence is common even years after surgery, which can lead to a poor quality of life. Current non-surgical&nbsp;strategies to mitigate recurrent carcinoid syndrome include somatostatin analogs, which have many diverse side effects. As a result, maximizing quality of life becomes the focus for many care teams following surgery for these patients. Few studies in the United States have examined how quality of life changes in patients with these carcinoid tumors following surgical interventions. In addition, these studies were only cross-sectional surveys that examined quality of life at a single time point. To our knowledge, no study has analyzed quality of life changes in carcinoid patients in a prospective and longitudinal manner. This study aims to assess changes in self-reported quality of life in patients with carcinoid tumors following resection procedures.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We administered prospective, longitudinal quality of life assessments using a validated instrument, the 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12). The SF-12 is a multipurpose short form survey that captures information on overall health-related quality of life, physical functioning, and mental functioning. For these subjects with carcinoid tumors, we conducted a baseline survey preoperatively&nbsp;and&nbsp;a 3-month post-operative survey, as possible if not lost to follow up. Paired t-tests were used to compare the&nbsp;quality of life ratings of the&nbsp;participants at the different time points with&nbsp;their own previous response as a reference. Subjects were consented for participation at the initial surgical consultation.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The SF-12 was&nbsp;administered to 6 patients who qualified for this&nbsp;study performed in a prospective manner. On question 11 of the SF-12, patients are asked how often they felt &ldquo;downhearted and blue&rdquo; in the last four weeks. The study participants reported feeling this way significantly less often three&nbsp;months&nbsp;following surgical resection than prior to the surgery (p = 0.046).

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Overall, patients displayed an increase in quality of life as reported on the SF-12 following surgical resection of their carcinoid tumors. This is&nbsp;most likely due to the cessation of carcinoid syndrome symptoms upon removal of the tumor and its subsequent neuroendocrine effects on&nbsp;the patients&#39; underlying physiology.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in conjunction with the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC) remains the main diagnostic standard in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. The incidence of thyroid nodule detection has been steadily increasing over the last few decades; therefore, determining with confidence which lesions require further surgical management is an important clinical consideration. This study examines the correlation of FNA to final pathology in a large series of surgical patients undergoing thyroidectomy after BSRTC adoption at a single academic institution.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective review of&nbsp;prospectively&nbsp;collected data of 1318 patients who underwent FNA of a solitary thyroid nodule and thyroidectomy from&nbsp;a single institution between 2010-2019 was performed. The cases were stratified into the 6 Bethesda categories: 1) Non-diagnostic (ND); 2) Benign; 3) atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS); 4) follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN); 5) suspicious for malignancy (SFM); 6) Malignant; and compared to the risk of malignancy reported by the BSRTC. FNA results were compared to the index thyroid nodule and incidental malignancy on final histopathology. In addition, demographics including age, sex and extent of surgical operation were analyzed along with predictive ultrasound factors associated with malignancy.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 1318 patients who underwent thyroidectomy, the malignancy rate of the index thyroid nodule on final histopathology was 54%. When the incidental malignancies were included, the overall malignancy rate increased to 62%. When stratified by FNA Bethesda category, the malignancy rate was 31% in ND; 14% in Benign; 50% in AUS/FLUS; 62% in FN/SFN; 86% in SFM; and 98% in malignant patients on final pathology. Rate of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) classical type was 43%, PTC follicular variant was 38%, follicular thyroid carcinoma was 3.4%, and medullary thyroid carcinoma was 1.7% in all malignant thyroid nodules. Among 345 patients with benign FNA, 82% of all nodules were &ge; 1 cm. Among 302 patients with malignant FNA, 82% of all nodules were also &ge; 1 cm. Overall, there was a false positive rate of 1.2% and a false negative rate of 14%. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this surgical series, patients with FNA of a dominant thyroid nodule after thyroidectomy had an overall malignancy rate of 54%. There was a 14% malignancy rate in patients with benign FNA results referred for surgical resection where additional factors such as family history of thyroid cancer, suspicious ultrasound findings, and/or history of radiation exposure may have influenced the decision for surgical resection. The additional use of genetic tests and ultrasound findings may help guide surgical evaluation. Overall, the majority of patients with AUS/FLUS, FN/SFN, and SFM results with underlying malignancy received the appropriate surgical resection.

Martucci<sup>2</sup>, V. Lai<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Washington Hospital Center,Washington, DC, USA <sup>2</sup>Georgetown University School of Medicine,Washington, DC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation or therapy has an important role for certain differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients. Remnant uptake, the volume of residual thyroid tissue prior to receiving RAI, may be a marker of the thoroughness of the surgical resection; a higher remnant is associated with a higher rate of recurrence. In the United States, outcomes disparities exist among ethnic/racial minorities with DTC.&nbsp; They have worse survival and decreased access to high-volume surgeons, who have improved outcomes. The reason for this phenomenon is poorly understood.&nbsp; Specific data about surgical thoroughness and recurrence rates for different races/ethnicities, which would help understand outcomes disparities, do not exist.&nbsp; This study aimed to compare the amount of thyroid remnant as seen on remnant uptake across race/ethnicity, and evaluate its association with cancer recurrence.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This was a retrospective analysis of adult patients with DTC who had postoperative RAI in 2017 and 2018. Thyroid bed remnant was calculated from the postoperative RAI scan and analyzed as a ratio of percent uptake to dose of RAI received (UDR) to control for varying RAI doses.&nbsp; Patient charts, laboratory and radiographic studies were reviewed to assess for disease recurrence through 2020. Thyroid remnant, UDR, and recurrence were evaluated across race/ethnicity.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;301 of 320 patients had race/ethnicity data and were included in the study: 58% were White, 25% Black, 8% Asian, 1% American Indian, and 8% were Hispanic. 76% were female.&nbsp; Papillary thyroid carcinoma was found in 89% of patients, follicular thyroid carcinoma in 8%, H&uuml;rthle cell carcinoma in 1%, and 2% had unknown pathology.&nbsp; Pathology subtypes (p=0.34), T stage (p=0.11), N stage (p=0.10), and presence of gross extrathyroidal extension (p=0.51) were the same across race/ethnicity. &nbsp;Most surgeons were high-volume, although volume data were not available for all.&nbsp; No differences in median percent uptake or UDR existed: median remnant was 0.67% for Whites, 0.47% for Blacks, 1.19% for Asians, 0.54% for Hispanics, and 0.1% for American Indians (p = 0.14); median UDR was 6.2 x 10<sup>-5 </sup>for Whites, 4.3 x 10<sup>-5 </sup>&nbsp;for Blacks, 8.4 x 10<sup>-5 &nbsp;</sup>for Asians, 5.3 x 10<sup>-5 </sup>&nbsp;for Hispanics, and 6.4 x 10<sup>-6 </sup>&nbsp;for American Indians (p = 0.198). We did not observe a difference in the recurrence rates: 8.8% for Whites, 16.9% for Blacks, 16.8% for Asians, 16.7% for Hispanics, 0% for American Indians (p = 0.46).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;For patients largely cared for by high-volume surgeons, we did not observe disparities across race/ethnicity in oncologic thoroughness, as seen with remnant uptake and UDR, or in recurrence.&nbsp; Expansion of this study to include longer follow-up and more patients cared for by surgeons of varying operative volumes may help provide additional insight into outcomes disparities among ethnic/racial minorities.&nbsp; Our findings support further study into causes of access disparities to high-quality surgeons.

Lindeman<sup>1</sup>, H. Chen<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Fatigue is a common presenting symptom in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). While fatigue alone is not a discrete indication for parathyroidectomy, it can have a significant detrimental effect on patient quality of life. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are underlying differences in demographic or disease characteristics in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who present with fatigue compared to those who do not.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We reviewed a prospective database of 2197 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for PHPT by three endocrine surgeons from 2001 to 2019. Data was abstracted from clinical and operative notes including patient demographics, laboratory data, and pathology reports. All patients in the database were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of fatigue as a presenting symptom. Objective measures of disease severity, such as biochemical markers,&nbsp;clinical indications&nbsp;for surgical intervention, and surgical outcomes, were then&nbsp;compared between groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 2197 patients, 1379 (63%) reported fatigue as a presenting symptom. Mean age in years was 59 &plusmn; 0 for patients with fatigue compared to 61 &plusmn; 0 for those without (p = 0.078). Patients with fatigue were more likely to be of female gender (80%) compared to the No Fatigue group (76% female) (p = 0.046). Preoperative calcium was lower in the Fatigue group (10.8 &plusmn; 0.1 vs. 11.1 &plusmn; 0 mg/dL, p = 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in preoperative serum parathyroid hormone levels between groups.&nbsp;Patients with fatigue had smaller parathyroid glands (581 &plusmn; 24 vs. 741 &plusmn; 43 mg, p = 0.001). Importantly, patients with fatigue had a higher incidence of multiglandular disease as the cause of their PHPT (37% vs 27%, p = 0.001) and were more likely to present with normocalcemic PHPT (28% vs 16%, p = 0.001). No significant differences in cure rate, recurrence rate, or history of nephrolithiasis were detected between groups

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Patients with PHPT who report fatigue as at least one of their presenting symptoms present with more complex disease as manifested by a higher incidence of multiglandular disease, more normocalcemic PHPT, and smaller parathyroid glands. Despite this, surgical cure is equivalent to other patients.&nbsp;Therefore, parathyroidectomy should be offered to these patients.

Failure to rescue (FTR) is the phenomenon whereby delayed recognition and/or response to serious surgical complications leads to a progressive cascade of adverse events culminating in death. Rescue Improvement Conference is an adapted version of a traditional morbidity and mortality (M&amp;M) conference, designed to address common contributors to FTR: ineffective communication and inadequate problem solving among clinicians. During each session, cases are reviewed by multiple stakeholders, capitalizing on their collective experiences to identify and implement multilevel improvements for the timely identification and treatment of post-operation complications.&nbsp;In this study, we sought to understand the acceptability and effectiveness of&nbsp;Rescue Improvement Conference.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We used both quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate Rescue Improvement Conference, a bi-monthly forum that was first introduced in our academic medical center in fall 2018. Conference effectiveness data were collected via survey and open-text responses after five Rescue Improvement Conferences between September 2018 and February 2020. Twelve surgical faculty and house staff also participated in semi-structured interviews to evaluate Rescue Improvement Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:According to the survey data (N=140) conference attendees felt that the case presentations had educational value, there were clear takeaways, there was adequate time for discussion, the case discussion would inform their future practice, and that&nbsp;Rescue Improvement Conferences&nbsp;present actionable opportunities for improvement (see Table 1). The qualitative data supports the quantitative findings, and two additional themes emerged: novelty and conference moderation. Interviewees found Rescue Improvement Conference to be more interactive and more representative of diverse voices than traditional M&amp;M. And while traditional M&amp;M focuses primarily on individual decision-making,&nbsp;Rescue Improvement Conference&nbsp;focuses on multilevel problem solving among surgeons and clinicians from other departments and disciplines. Interviewees also appreciated moderators who were open to others&rsquo; opinions, kept the conference on track, and used rescue concepts and related frameworks to evaluate cases.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Rescue Improvement Conference provides interdisciplinary stakeholders a forum to identify, discuss, and mitigate factors that contribute to FTR.&nbsp;We are currently using this feedback to further refine Rescue Improvement Conference in our institution, while also preparing to package it for implementation in other academic surgical departments.

Worth, TEXAS, USA <sup>2</sup>Baylor University Medical Center,Department Of Surgery,Dallas, TEXAS, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Despite significant time commitments for both patients and surgeons, the utility of routine in-person clinic appointments after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the utility of routine in-person follow-up for all patients undergoing LC and predictors of non-routine follow-up encounters in these patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We retrospectively reviewed follow-up encounters for 665 consecutive patients undergoing isolated LC for benign indications at a safety-net teaching hospital from April 2018 through January 2020. Twenty patients converted to open cholecystectomy were exluded. All patients were routinely scheduled for follow-up in clinic 2-4 weeks after discharge. Follow-up was considered non-routine if the patient was readmitted within 30 days or if any of the following occurred at the&nbsp;clinic appointment: intervention performed (including wound care), new imaging/labs ordered, new medication prescribed, referral to ED, or malignancy on pathology. A multivariate logistic regression model was generated using backwards elimination based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to identify risk factors for non-routine follow-up.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The scheduled follow-up appointment was attended by 452 (68%) patients, and the remaining 213 (32%) were &ldquo;no-shows.&rdquo; A total of 80 patients were readmitted or had non-routine clinic visits. Readmission occurred in 42 patients, with no differences between clinic attenders and &ldquo;no-show&rdquo; patients. Readmission occurred on mean day 9 after discharge&nbsp;and prior to scheduled follow-up in 83% of cases. The clinic visit&nbsp;was non-routine for 40 patients (6% of all patients; 9% of those attending clinic); reasons (not mutually exclusive) included: drainage of seroma (n=5), drain removal (n=3), new imaging (n=12), new labs (n=6), antibiotics for incisional cellulitis (n=2), pain medication prescription (n=13), referral to ED (n=2), and malignant pathology (n=1).&nbsp;Increasing age (+2% risk per year), diabetes, and chronic kidney disease were the strongest predictors of non-routine follow-up (Table).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The incidence of non-routine postoperative course warranting further evaluation or intervention during&nbsp;follow-up clinic after LC is low, and nearly one-third of patients do not attend their follow-up appointment. Readmission typically occurred prior to routinely scheduled follow-up. Thus, routine in-person clinic appointments for all patients after LC may not be necessary.&nbsp;In an era of renewed interest in telehealth, prospective evaluation of a protocol for postoperative follow-up of LC patients via default telehealth visits (with selective in-patient follow-up for older patients and those with comorbidities) within one week of discharge is planned.

The methods used to identify and record complications have a critical impact on the usefulness of the data. We created a novel, HIPAA-compliant, web-based smartphone application (app) to enable prospective collection of complication data by crowdsourcing. We hypothesized that this system would provide more accurate and complete data than standard methods.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;An app was created to automatically download the surgery schedule from the electronic medical record. Attendings and residents were trained to use the app and used a mobile phone to input data at the bedside or in clinic as complications were identified. All members of the surgical teams had simultaneous access to the app and the ability to record complications. Complication data recorded in the app from&nbsp;July 8, 2019 to July 10, 2020 was retrospectively compared to complication data obtained from a hospital administrative database (AD) that is used for quality improvement.&nbsp;Analysis was performed using chi-squared tests for categorical variables and Cohen&rsquo;s kappa to assess concordance between databases.&nbsp;A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Case data from 4,552 inpatient and outpatient cases from the acute care, bariatrics, surgical oncology, endocrine, colorectal, vascular, and transplant services was automatically imported into the app. The AD, which only captures inpatient cases, had case data for 1,314 of these cases. Of these 1,314 inpatient cases, there was a higher incidence of cases with at least 1 complication in the AD compared to the app (306 (23.3%) vs. 62 (4.7%), p-value &lt;0.001). To assess concordance between the systems, the 62 cases with at least 1 inpatient complication recorded in the app were compared with those in the AD. The AD only captured complications for 37 of these cases (59.7%) and there was no agreement between the databases (Cohen&rsquo;s kappa -0.403, p&lt;0.001). Respiratory, GU, and &lsquo;other&rsquo; complications were captured more frequently by the AD while hemorrhage/hematoma was recorded more frequently in the app (Figure 1). The AD captured 100% of respiratory and thrombotic complications that were reported in the app. The rate of agreement was lower for other complications (67% for cardiac, 50% for CNS, GU, and sepsis, 41% for hemorrhage/hematoma, 40% for GI, and 25% for wound), suggesting that complications considered important by clinicians (i.e. hemorrhage, wound infection) are frequently missed in the AD.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Crowdsourcing complication data entry using an app is&nbsp;an innovative way to record clinically relevant complications. The app serves as a useful adjunct to existing ADs to more completely assess postoperative outcomes.

In the public, the surgeons and their teams are responsible, while in the private sector the anaesthetist is typically the prescriber of discharge medications. We sought to investigate the differing practices of these two groups via physician survey.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We emailed consultant general surgeons and consultant anaesthetists in our local district requesting participation in an online survey on their individual prescribing practices. We used local mailing lists from both public and private hospitals in the district to identify potential respondents. The survey requested information surrounding the routine discharge prescription practices after the following uncomplicated operations: laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA), elective inguinal hernia repairs (IH), and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). The study has been approved by the local ethics committee.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;66 consultants responded to the survey, 38 anaesthetists and 28 surgeons. The anaesthetic cohort were more likely to prescribe opioids for all operations than their surgeon counterparts: LA 16.7% vs 34.3%, IH 30.8% vs 52.9%, LC 26.9% vs 70.3%. Despite this, only LC reached statistical significance (p=0.002). The mean quantity of opioids theoretically prescribed (in oral morphine equivalents) by each prescribing group likewise differed, with the anaesthetic cohort averaging higher quantities for all procedures: LA 7.8 vs 58.88 (p=0.024), IH 27.6 vs 52.73 (p&lt;0.001), and LC 21.6 vs 73.13 (p=0.007).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This survey demonstrates that there may be a difference in prescribing practices between the surgeon and anaesthetic cohorts. Moreover because of the different settings of each of these prescribing groups (i.e. public vs private practice) patients may be receiving differing quantities of opioids in the private and public setting. While our study does not specifically look at the frequency and quantity of opioids prescribed to actual patients, it does highlight areas for potential change when dealing with the over-prescription of opioid medications after general surgical procedures. Further prospective studies are required to investigate the actual difference in prescribing between the public and private sectors.

Despite high-quality evidence and professional recommendations, routine preoperative testing is common. Eliminating unnecessary preoperative testing has thus become a critical opportunity to improve value-based surgical care. The objectives of this study were to characterize hospital variations in preoperative testing prior to common low-risk ambulatory&nbsp;surgical procedures in Michigan.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective analysis of claims data from the Michigan Value Collaborative (MVC) was performed to identify patients who underwent&nbsp;lumpectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair between January 1, 2015 to June 30, 2019.&nbsp;The MVC is a Blue Cross Blue Shield funded collaborative quality initiative comprised of 87 hospitals across the state of Michigan with&nbsp;prospectively collected data on patient demographics, perioperative care, and spending for patients undergoing surgical procedures. Preoperative tests included cardiac testing (i.e., EKG, ECHO, or stress tests), chest radiography, laboratory studies (i.e., CBC, BMP, coagulation tests), urinalysis, pulmonary function testing, and history and physical examinations performed within 30 days of the surgical procedure. We estimated rates of testing before the three procedures separately and together at the hospital level. Hospitals with fewer than 10 surgical procedures were excluded.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The cohort included 10,026 patients who underwent lumpectomy, 22,072 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and 10,513 patients who underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Among 42,611 patients, 37.9% (n=16,147) were male and 44.3% (n=18,896) were at least 65 years old. Mean rates of preoperative testing were 70.9%, 70.6%, and 57.0% for lumpectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, respectively. There were wide variations at the hospital level in testing before each of the surgical procedures. For example, the rate of preoperative EKGs ranged from 0% to 82% for lumpectomy, 11% to 53% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and 0% to 71% for inguinal hernia repair. The rate of preoperative chest radiography ranged from 0% to 60% for lumpectomy, 0% to 29% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and 2% to 52% for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. The rate of preoperative history and physical examination ranged from 75% to 100% for lumpectomy, 64% to 96% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and 52% to 94% for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Wide variations and high rates of&nbsp;testing before low-risk surgical procedures at hospitals across Michigan suggest overuse of these services and represent an opportunity to reduce spending and improve patient outcomes. Further work is needed to understand the drivers of this variation.

Clinical factors included in the decision to tracheostomize patients after cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI) are an ongoing topic of debate. The goal of this study was to analyze patients with CSCI and neurological deficit to delineate variables predictive for tracheostomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This retrospective cohort study included 255 patients with CSCI and neurological deficit admitted to three Level 1 Trauma Centers between February 2015 and March 2020. There were 44 patients tracheostomized (TR) during their hospital stay who were compared to 211 patients who were not tracheostomized (NTR). Analyzed variables included age, mechanism of injury (MOI), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment grade, Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for spine, Neurological Level of Injury (NLI), and the rates of cervical vertebrae fracture, facet dislocation, and paravertebral hematoma formation. Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The TR and NTR groups were of similar age (52.5 vs 58.7, p=0.06) and experienced similar MOI (61.4% MVC, 27.3% fall vs 46.4% MVC, 46.4% fall, p=0.09). The TR group had a significantly higher ISS (31.3 vs 18.8, p&lt;0.001) and lower GCS (10.3 vs 13.9, p&lt;0.001) than the NTR group. The ASIA score distribution between groups was significantly different (p&lt;0.001), with the TR group having a significantly higher rate of ASIA A and B scores (68.2% vs 15.2%) compared to NTR. Similarly, distribution of AIS spine score between groups was significantly different (p&lt;0.001), with the TR group having a significantly higher rate of critical and maximal AIS spinal scores (65.9% vs 17.5%) compared to NTR. NLI distribution was not different between the groups (p=0.9), with the most common NLI in both groups at C4 (25.6% vs 27.1%) and C5 (25.6% vs 20.8%). Regarding vertebrae injury, TR patients had a significantly higher rate of cervical fractures (81.8% vs 49.8%, p&lt;0.001) and cervical facet dislocation (38.6% vs 18.5%, p=0.003) than NTR patients [Fig.1]. Incidence of paravertebral hematoma formation was similar between the TR and NTR groups (34.1% vs 29.4%, p=0.5). Multivariable analysis found that only ASIA grades A and B were a significant predictor of the need for tracheostomy (p=0.003).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
ASIA grades A and B, as spinal injury severity indicators, were found to be predictors of the need for tracheostomy following a cervical spinal cord injury with neurological deficit, while the neurological level of injury was not a predictor. Supplemental factors for tracheostomy consideration include the presence of cervical facet dislocation or cervical vertebrae fractures.

Gani<sup>1</sup>, P. Pockney<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Hunter New England Health,Department Of Surgery,Newcastle, NSW, Australia","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Small bowel obstruction is a common indication for emergency laparotomy. In an audit of all emergency laparotomies performed on adults at four centres over a three-year period, small bowel obstruction was the most common indication for surgery, comprising 36.5% of 1111 cases. Significant variability was noted in the timing of surgical management, and there is a paucity of published evidence to support the hypothesis that delayed surgery has a negative impact on patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to determine whether delayed surgical management of small bowel obstruction is associated with a higher 30-day mortality rate.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Data was collected retrospectively from the medical records of all patients aged 18 years or older who underwent&nbsp;emergency laparotomy for small bowel obstruction at four hospitals between January 2016 and December 2018. The primary outcome measure was 30?day mortality, with patients grouped according to the timeframe from admission until surgery (&lt;24 hours, 24-72 hours and &gt;72 hours).&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

337 patients underwent emergency laparotomy with adhesiolysis or bowel&nbsp;resection for small bowel obstruction. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 27/337 (8%). There was no difference in mortality between patients who had surgery performed in under 24 hours compared with those who had surgery within 24-72 hours (7.1% 30-day mortality for both groups, p=0.99). These two groups were therefore combined and compared with those who had surgery more than 72 hours after hospital admission. Patients who had a delay to surgery of more than 72 hours had a higher 30-day mortality rate (11.4%), although this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.24).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Among patients requiring emergency laparotomy for small bowel obstruction, a delay to surgery of greater than&nbsp;72 hours&nbsp;was associated with higher 30?day mortality. Although this did&nbsp;not reach statistical significance, the findings from this relatively small cohort are consistent with published international data from the UK-based NELA audit. This suggests that there may be potential to improve the management SBO our healthcare system, as has been demonstrated internationally.

Worth, TEXAS, USA <sup>2</sup>Baylor University Medical Center,Department Of Surgery,Dallas, TEXAS, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Ample evidence exists to support the safety of fast-track discharge following elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), but there is currently no data available to support the safety of fast-tracking patients undergoing non-elective LC. We sought to determine whether fast-tracking patients undergoing non-elective LC is safe and feasible.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a retrospective review of 665 consecutive patients undergoing LC at a single teaching institution from Apr 2018 to Jan 2020. Subjects were divided into two groups: elective LC (ELC) and fast-track non-elective LC (FTLC). FTLC was defined as non-elective LC with total length of stay (LOS) less than 36 hours. Patients undergoing non-elective LC with LOS exceeding 36 hours were excluded. The primary outcome of interest was readmission within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included incidences of return to emergency department within 30 days, retained stone, bile leak, and wound infection. ELC and FTLC were compared with Student&rsquo;s t and Fischer&rsquo;s exact testing (p &lt; 0.05 considered significant).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of 665 LC, 187 (28%) were elective and 478 (72%) were non-elective. FTLC included 122 (25%) of the non-elective LC. ELC had higher rates of hypertension and GERD, but otherwise preoperative characteristics were similar. On final pathology, chronic cholecystitis was predominant in both groups, but FTLC exhibited higher rates of acute cholecystitis (p &lt; 0.001) There was no significant difference in the primary outcome between groups: readmission within 30 days occurred in 7 (4%) ELC patients and 4 (3%) FTLC patients (p = 1.0). There were no significant differences in any secondary outcome (Table).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;With comparable post-operative complication rates to elective LC, fast-track non-elective LC can safely be employed in select patients.&nbsp; Additional studies are needed to determine pre-operative predictors to prospectively identify appropriate patients.

Glass<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>New Jersey Medical School,Surgery,Newark, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Cirrhosis has traditionally been seen as a contraindication to elective surgery.&nbsp; Abdominal wall hernias are common in patients with cirrhosis and when associated ascites these hernias can sometimes become symptomatic, ruptured, incarcerated, or strangulated, and require urgent herniorraphy.&nbsp; We reviewed management of cirrhotic patients who required herniorraphy at a safety net hospital to assess optimal management for these complex patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing hernia repair who had cirrhosis at an urban safety net hospital over a 3 year period. Patient demographics, cirrhosis characteristics, procedures performed, hospital course, and discharge disposition were abstracted. Patients with prolonged length of stay, death, or other complications were further reviewed to identify areas for improvement.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 48 cirrhotic patients who underwent hernia repair.&nbsp; The majority of patients were male (32) and the average age was 58.&nbsp; Half of hernias were ventral/incisional, one third were umbilical, and the rest were either inguinal or other. Over half of patients presented for elective surgery, and were not admitted to the hospital postoperatively. &nbsp;Most patients presenting emergently underwent open surgery, while nearly half in the elective group underwent laparoscopic hernia repair. There were a few major complications primarily pneumonia, and other post-operative infections; 1/3 of patients had prolonged lengths of stay &gt;7 days; and one patient died.&nbsp; The patients with prolonged lengths of stay were primarily in the emergency surgery group.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Most patients with cirrhosis had good short-term outcomes, and uncomplicated postop care.&nbsp; With modern perioperative care, the perception of surgery as contraindicated in stable cirrhotics is unwarranted. As expected, patients requiring emergent operations had much worse outcomes and these data suggest that a more aggressive approach about fixing symptomatic hernias in cirrhotic patients early on is needed in order to avoid poor outcomes.

Recent evidence demonstrates that adult trauma centers overutilize CT scans during the evaluation of pediatric and adolescent trauma patients. The aim of this study is to review the use of abdominal/pelvic CT scans (APCT) in adolescent trauma patients. The hypothesis is&nbsp;that the center has a high rate of CT usage and a low rate of positive CT scans within this population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a retrospective review of adolescent (13 to 18-year-old) blunt trauma patients from an urban adult level 1 trauma center from January 2016 to December 2019. The trauma database was accessed to identify patients &lt; 18 years old that underwent an APCT scan after&nbsp;blunt trauma.&nbsp;The primary outcome was the prevalence of positive findings on APCT scan.&nbsp; Additionally, clinical risk factors concerning for intra-abdominal injury were collected, which included tachycardia, hypotension, abdominal or pelvic pain, abnormal abdominal or pelvic&nbsp;exam (tenderness, distension, &quot;seatbelt sign), pelvic fracture on x-ray, abnormal FAST exam, elevated transaminases, microhematuria and a hematocrit &lt; 30%.&nbsp; &nbsp;Moderate to severe injuries were defined as those with an abdominal abbreviated injury scale &ge; 2 which includes injuries with a &gt; 1% threat to life such as solid organ injury or bowel&nbsp;and bladder perforation. The correlation of clinical risk factors with intra-abdominal injury were analyzed using univariate Fischer-Exact analysis.&nbsp; Variables with significant correlation (p value &le; 0.05) were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 251 patients underwent an APCT. Of those, 67% (167) were male;&nbsp;the mean age was 16.6&plusmn;1.5 years, and 54% (136) were African American. The most common mechanism of injury was motor vehicle collision (61%) and the mean injury severity score (ISS) was 17.3&plusmn;11.9. 97 (39%) patients had a positive finding on APCT.&nbsp; Of those&nbsp;25&nbsp;(26%) had&nbsp;pelvic injury, 55&nbsp;(57%) had&nbsp;intra-abdominal injury and 17&nbsp;(18%) had a combination.&nbsp;Of patients with positive CT, 57 (59%)&nbsp;had a moderate to severe abdominal injury and 13 (13%)&nbsp;required&nbsp;surgical intervention.&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk factors for intra-abdominal injury were present in 100% of patients with intra-abdominal injury and absent in 28% of patients without intra-abdominal injury.&nbsp; On multivariate analysis&nbsp;abnormal abdominal exam (OR = 13.9; 95% CI: 4.8-40.1; p &lt; 0.01) and elevated transaminases (OR = 7.4 ; 95% CI: 2.7-20.5; p &lt; 0.01) were independent risk factors for intra-abdominal injury.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: APCT appears to be overutilized in the adolescent blunt trauma population. Approximately one third of patients without intra-abdominal injury had no identifiable clinical risk factor prior to undergoing their CT. Future quality improvement projects focusing on identifying clinical risk factors prior to undergoing an APCT may reduce its use in adolescent trauma patients.

Early trauma team activation (TTA) allows an organized, multidisciplinary response to the care of the injured. Rapid data access through smartphone applications has reframed workplace procedure and policy, but its impact in the healthcare field remains unclear. Citizen is a free smartphone application that provides real-time alerts based on 911 dispatch data. Our primary objective was to determine whether these alerts occurred earlier than TTA times and emergency department (ED) arrival times.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Trauma registry data were extracted from a single level one trauma center from 1/1/2018 to 6/30/2019. Registry entries were compared to smartphone alert metadata from the trauma center catchment area during the same time period. Registry entries and metadata were matched according to mechanism of injury, date, time and location. Alert timestamps were compared to times for TTA and ED arrival. Percentage of time that alerts reported an injury earlier than registry times was computed along with exact binomial 95% confidence interval. Median differences between timestamps were presented along with interquartile ranges.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 3684 registry entries, 209 perfectly matched smartphone alert metadata. Alerts were earlier than 96.1% and 96.2% of TTA and ED arrival times, respectively. The application reported events a median of 36 (24-53, IQR) minutes earlier than TTA times and 32 (25-42, IQR) minutes earlier than ED arrival times. Registry entries for younger males, pedestrian struck, motor vehicle collisions and penetrating trauma were more likely to match alerts (p&lt;0.0001) (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Smartphone applications may provide earlier notification of traumatic events therefore earlier TTA and mobilization of resources. This earlier notification may translate into more organized care and improved patient outcomes. Additional studies into the benefit of smartphone applications for trauma care are warranted.

Definitive hemorrhage control is a critical step in decreasing morbidity and mortality from severe pelvic fractures. One step in the algorithm for treating pelvic fractures with active hemorrhage is by performing angiography and embolization of the pelvic arteries. Measuring the time to angiography for patients requiring embolization can be used to identify where system changes can be made to expedite the treatment of trauma patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted a retrospective review (January 2012-December 2017) of adult patients (&gt;17y) with pelvic fractures who arrived to our Level 1, urban trauma center. Data was collected on age, sex, race, injury severity score (ISS), presence of hemodynamic compromise&nbsp;(HC), initiation of massive transfusion protocol (MTP), time of arrival, time of CT scan, time to receive CT scan results, time to angiography, complications and mortality. Presence of hemodynamic compromise was defined as a systolic blood pressure &lt;90mmHg and/or heart rate &gt;120bpm.Time of arrival was categorized as day (0700-1859 hrs.) and night (1900-0659 hrs.), based on the Interventional Radiology (IR) attending rotation schedule. We used Wilcoxon Two-sample test to analyze the data and Wald Chi Square for single and multiple variable analysis using a p-value of 0.05 to evaluate significance.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
&nbsp;A total of 1263 patients were identified with pelvic fractures, of which 78 (6.2%) requiring embolization by IR. Of the patient requiring embolization, the average time to angiography was 83 minutes (SD 117.37 minutes). The average time to angiography for patients arriving in the day was 58 minutes compared 108 minutes at night (p=.0208). There was no difference in time to angiography between patients with hemodynamic compromise with initiation of MTP and those who presented hemodynamically stable (HC+MTP, 70 min; hemodynamically stable, 85 minutes, p=.7193). Single variable and multivariable analysis of age, sex, race, presence of hemodynamic compromise and time to angiography did not influence the outcome of mortality.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our data suggest that there was no statistically significant difference in time to IR between patient with and without hemodynamic compromise. However, there was a significant increase in time to angiography when comparing time of arrival at the hospital with an increased time during the night compared to daytime. Given the results, we can focus on creating ways to improve the significant difference in time to angiography.

The benefits of specialty treatment for rib fractures has not been shown. We hypothesized that patients with high risk rib fractures treated in high acuity trauma centers would have better outcomes than patients treated in other centers.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All rib fracture patients were identified via the 2016 Nationwide Inpatient Sample using ICD-10 codes; abbreviated injury scales (AIS) and Elixhauser comorbidity scores were also extracted. Chest AIS was grouped as mild (&lt;=1) or severe (&gt;=2). All patients with AIS&gt;2 in any other body region were excluded. High acuity trauma hospitals (TH) were defined as hospitals which transferred 0% of neurotrauma patients; all other hospitals were defined as Non-trauma Hospitals (NTH). Poor outcome was defined as any patient who died, had a tracheostomy, developed pneumonia, or had a length of stay in the longest decile. Logistic regression with an interaction term for TH and chest trauma severity was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 29,780 patients with rib fractures were identified (median age 64 (IQR 51-79), 60% male), of which 22% had poor outcomes. 53% of patients were treated at TH. In unadjusted comparisons, poor outcomes occurred more often at TH than NTH (22.4% vs. 21.4%, p=0.03). However, after adjustment for other factors, severe chest trauma that was not transferred was associated with more poor outcomes (OR 1.6, &lt;0.001).&nbsp;(Table1) Male sex, nonwhite race and more comorbidities were also associated with poor outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: More than 20% of rib fracture patients have a poor outcome.&nbsp; Mild chest trauma can be safely treated at NTH, but severe chest trauma outcomes are improved at TH. Development of transfer criteria for chest injuries in high-risk patients may help mitigate poor outcomes at hospitals who lack appropriate expertise.

Patient loss to follow-up (LTF) after hospitalization for injury increases risk of complications. Identification of patients at risk for LTF prior to discharge would direct targeted interventions and may improve clinic attendance.&nbsp;We sought to develop a predictive model for LTF under the hypothesis that patient data available prior to discharge could be used to identify patients at risk for LTF.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We matched records from our institutional trauma registry with our electronic health record from 2017 to 2019. The primary outcome of interest was LTF, defined as absence from&nbsp;the first clinic visit after discharge.&nbsp; We excluded patients who died and patients admitted in the last study month. We assessed patient demographic characteristics, injury diagnoses, severity, surgical interventions, and insurance status. Variables associated with LTF at p&lt;0.2 in univariate analysis were included in a multivariable logistic regression model.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

We included 1,386 patients (mean (SD) age 41 (19) years, 71% black, 76% male, 57% blunt mechanism), of whom 293 (21%) were LTF.&nbsp;In multivariable analysis, factors associated with increased odds of LTF included Medicare insurance (OR1.55, 95%CI 1.02-2.41) and increased ICU days (OR1.09, 95%CI 1.02-1.16), while factors associated with decreased odds of LTF included laparotomy (OR 0.32, 95%CI 0.14-0.70), increased&nbsp;hospital days (OR 0.95, 95%CI 0.90-0.99), and higher abbreviated injury score severity (OR 0.77, 95%CI 0.57-1.04). Furthermore, only 24% of patients who missed their first clinic visit attended any subsequent clinic visit.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Using data available prior to discharge, it is possible to identify subsets of injured patients who are more likely to be LTF. Interventions should target these higher-risk patients. High-risk subsets of patients may be institution-specific. Replication of our methods should define the population at greatest risk for LTF at other institutions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We analyzed adult patients with a severe (abbreviated injury scale&ge;3) penetrating truncal injury from level 1 and 2 centers in Pennsylvania in 2019 using ISM, excluding centers with &lt;10 such injuries.

The impact of cervical vertebrae fractures on the severity of neurological deficit in cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI) continues to be debated. The aim of this study was to characterize injury patterns and outcomes in patients with CSCI and cervical vertebrae fractures.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This retrospective cohort study included 255 CSCI patients with neurological deficit admitted to three Level 1 Trauma Centers between 2015 and 2020. 141 patients with cervical vertebrae fractures (CF) were compared to 114 patients without cervical vertebrae fractures (NCF). Analyzed variables included: age, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), mechanism of injury (MOI), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for spine, American Spinal Injury Association impairment grade (ASIA), neurological level of impairment (NLI), paravertebral hematoma, facet dislocation, mechanical ventilation (MV), ICU admission, ICU length of stay (ICULOS), hospital LOS (HLOS), discharge disposition, and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Cervical vertebrae fractures were present in half (55.3%) of CSCI patients with neurological deficit. Age, prevalence of comorbidities, and MOI were not different between groups. The CF group had significantly lower BMI (26.0 vs 27.9, p=0.007). ISS was significantly higher in the CF group (23.0 vs 18.5, p=0.007), and AIS for spine distribution was statistically different (p&lt;0.001), with 35.5% of the CF group versus 14.0% of the NCF group having critical or maximal injuries. ASIA distribution between groups was also significantly different (p&lt;0.001), with 36.1% in the CF group versus 9.7% in the NCF group suffering motor paralysis and having ASIA grade A or B [Fig. 1]. NLI distribution between groups was similar. Significantly more CF patients had cervical paravertebral hematoma (43.3% vs 14.0%) and cervical facet dislocation (35.5% vs 5.3%), both p&lt;0.001. MV requirements were significantly higher in the CF group (48.9% vs 16.7%), with significantly higher number of patients requiring endotracheal intubation (23.4% vs 9.6%) and tracheostomy (25.5% vs 7.0%), all p&lt;0.005. CF patients were admitted to the ICU significantly more often (84.4% vs 62.3%, p&lt;0.001) and had significantly longer ICULOS (10.4 vs 6.3 days, p=0.006) and HLOS (25.9 vs 12.4 days, p=0.03). Mortality (16.3% vs 4.4%, p=0.002) and discharge to hospice (12.8% vs 3.5%) were significantly higher in the CF group.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

CSCI patients with cervical vertebrae fractures had more frequent and severe neurological impairment. The presence of cervical vertebrae fractures was associated with longer hospitalization and higher ICU admission rate, mortality, and hospice discharge, and is an indicator for tracheostomy and a predictor for adverse outcomes.

Cocanour<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - Davis,General Surgery,Sacramento, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Trauma patients undergoing damage control laparotomy are frequently left with an open abdomen (OA). While often physiologically necessary, there are many potential complications with OA, including formation of enterocutaneous fistula and intra-abdominal infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;This study focuses on factors predictive of intra-abdominal abscess (IAA) development, specifically with regards to both fixed patient factors and modifiable operative factors.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a retrospective review of adult trauma patients admitted to a level 1 trauma center June 2016 - June 2019 who were initially managed with OA following damage control laparotomy. Patients who survived at least 7 days after surgery, allowing time for the development of IAA, were included. Univariate analysis of comorbidities, injuries, and surgical decision-making was performed.&nbsp;Subgroup analysis was performed on all patients who achieved fascial closure within three operations.&nbsp;Univariate factors approaching significance (p &lt;0.20) were included in multivariate logistic regression. Six-month follow-up data was collected on development of enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) and ventral hernia.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Ninety-one patients were included (79% male), with a median age of 40 years old (IQR 27-57). Twenty-four patients (26%) developed an IAA. All examined comorbidities had no significant association with IAA. The time to fascial closure was not significantly different between those who developed IAA and those who did not (50 vs. 45 hours, p= 0.42). Furthermore, receiving antibiotics throughout the entirety of having an open abdomen was not associated with IAA (58% vs. 61%, p= 0.8). Factors significant for IAA were abdominal AIS score (4 vs. 3, p= 0.03), interrupted facial closure (75% vs. 46%, p = 0.02), and any gastrointestinal (GI) injury (92% vs. 60%, p &lt; 0.01). On multivariable regression, interrupted fascial closure (OR 3.8) and any GI injury (OR 7.4) remained significant. Within the subgroup who achieved closure within three operations, interrupted fascial closure was significantly associated with IAA (67% vs. 38%, p= 0.05). Follow-up data was available for 65 patients; development of an enterocutaneous fistula was higher in those with prior IAA (18.8% vs 0%, p=0.01). Ventral hernia was not significantly higher (25% vs 8.2%, p=0.09).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Comorbid conditions historically associated with higher rates of infection showed no association with IAA formation after OA. Furthermore, administration of antibiotics did not impact the formation of IAA. However, both GI injury and fascial closure using an interrupted technique were significantly associated with IAA. The association of an interrupted fascial closure with IAA is unexpected and requires further study.

A reduction in utilization of opioids theoretically reduces side effects, such as delayed return of bowel function, and may decrease length of stay (LOS) of hospitalization. We hypothesized improvement in clinical outcomes for pain, LOS, and time to bowel movement (BM) would be associated with measurable reduction in MME.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective study of 300 patients who underwent a laparotomy after traumatic injury. A clinically significant reduction in pain was defined as a 2-point decrease in Numeric Pain Score (NPS). Average daily MME use over the first 72 hours of hospitalization was measured. The clinically significant difference in opioid MME was defined as the difference in MME use associated with a clinically significant difference in a clinical outcome (pain, LOS, BM). This was estimated for each outcome using &ldquo;inverse regression&rdquo; as d/beta, where d represents clinically relevant difference in outcome, and beta is the slope of the regression line of the outcome on MME.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Average daily MME was not associated with sex, age, race/ethnicity, or injury type, but trended higher with Injury Severity Score (ISS) (p=0.07). Adjusting for ISS, the clinically significant outcomes were average pain (p=0.034), time to first BM (p=0.002) and NGT (Nasogastric tube) duration (p=0.003) (Table 1). However, the clinically meaningful difference in MME was extremely large (464, 194, and 283 respectively).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:A strong relationship between MME and clinical outcomes was not found (Figure 1) and meaningful effects are very large. It appears that clinical outcomes of pain, LOS, and return of bowel function are affected by many factors, and it is difficult to induce a clinically meaningful change only by manipulating opioid dose. However, patients with very high MME could be a target, where large reductions are theoretically possible.

Meyers, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Trauma patients may initially be evaluated at non-trauma centers. This may cause a delay in treatment, which could affect their outcome. Additionally, advanced imaging may be performed which may be suboptimal or unnecessary, increase time to transfer or unable to be viewed when the patient reaches a trauma center increasing the delays to treatment or need for repeat imaging.&nbsp; Rapid identification and transfer to definitive trauma care, minimizing unnecessary delays should be the priority. With the development of an expedited trauma transfer protocol, we hypothesized there would be less advanced imaging prior to transfer and faster transfer to a Level 1 Trauma Center.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The trauma registry at a regional Level 1 Adult/Pediatric Trauma center was queried for transferred trauma patients over a 3-year period. Transferred trauma patients were compared prior to an expedited transfer protocol to after implementation. Demographics, mechanism of injury (MOI), injury severity score (ISS), CT scans performed prior to transfer, mortality, hospital and ICU LOS were compared using bivariate and multivariable regression statistics where appropriate.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Transferred trauma patients were identified, 683 in the pre-protocol group and 821 in the post-protocol group, an increase of 16.8%.&nbsp; There were no differences in age, sex, ISS, MOI, mortality, hospital or ICU LOS throughout the study period.&nbsp; There was a significant decrease in time to transfer (263 seconds &plusmn; 222 vs. 227 &plusmn; 189, p &lt;0.001) and CT scans performed prior to transfer (Head 47% vs 32%, C-spine 36% vs 23%, Thorax 22% vs 16%, Abdomen/Pelvis 24% vs 14%, all p-values &lt;0.001). Interestingly, the rate of underinsured patients did not increase (21% vs 25%, p=0.05).&nbsp; Risk-adjusted mortality and hospital LOS also did not change during the study period.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Implementation of an expedited trauma transfer protocol to a regional Level 1 trauma center improved time to arrival of definitive care and decreased advanced imaging done prior to transfer.&nbsp; However, this did not affect mortality or LOS among transferred patients.&nbsp; Interestingly, over the study period there was an increase in number of patients transferred without a change in ISS or underinsured rate. Further studies examining prehospital transport or hospital choice decisions and subsequent care provided at non-trauma hospitals for imaging, care rendered and transfer need further examination.

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NOM for geriatric abdominal solid organ injuries.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a 2014-2015 analysis of the Nationwide Readmission Database. We included all older adult (age &ge;65 years) isolated blunt abdominal trauma patients (extra-abdominal AIS&lt;2) with a liver, spleen, and/or renal injury. Patients who underwent operative intervention within 24 hours were excluded. Outcomes were failure of NOM and mortality within 6-months.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We identified 4,421 patients: 28% sustained a liver injury, 46% splenic injury, and 29% renal injury. Mean age was 76&plusmn;8y, 18% of injuries were high-grade, and 18% of patients underwent angioembolization. NOM failure rate was 10%, 7% occurring during index admission (2[1-2]d), while 3% within 32[22-32]d post-discharge. Splenic injuries had the highest failure rate (14%) compared to liver (10%) and renal injuries (2%) (p&lt;0.01). Overall mortality was 14% (index-admission: 12%; readmission: 2%). Mortality was highest in the liver (19%), followed by spleen (13%), then renal (10%) group (p&lt;0.01). Multiple factors predict failure of NOM. (Table 1)

Discharge destination after traumatic brain injury (TBI) should be based on a patient&rsquo;s recovery potential but may be influenced by non-patient factors like regional or institutional practice patterns. We hypothesized that non-patient factors would influence discharge destination in severe TBI patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All patients in the ACS Trauma Quality Improvement Program 2016 data set with severe TBI, defined as head Abbreviated Injury Scale &ge;3, were screened and categorized by discharge destination: home, rehab, skilled nursing or other care facility (SNF), and deceased. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with each destination; odds ratios and 95% confidence level are reported. Regressions were adjusted for age, gender, race, insurance status, GCS, ISS, penetrating trauma, region, neurosurgeon group size, teaching status, trauma center level, hospital size, and type of neurosurgical procedure.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
75,690 patients met inclusion criteria. 51% were discharged to home, 18% to rehab, 16% to SNF, and 11% deceased. Mortality was similar across geographical region, teaching status, and hospital size. Southern patients were more likely to be discharged to home while Northeastern patients were more likely to be discharged to rehab (Table). Treatment by groups of 3 or more neurosurgeons was associated with SNF discharge as was treatment at Community (OR: 1.11 [95% CI: 1.04 &ndash; 1.17]) or Non-Teaching hospitals (1.18 [1.08 &ndash; 1.29]). Patients treated at larger hospitals (defined as those with a total bed number &gt; 200) were both less likely to be discharged to rehab and more likely to be discharged to SNF.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Region, neurosurgeon group size, teaching status, and hospital size are significantly associated with variation in discharge destination following severe TBI. Regional and institutional variation in practice patterns may therefore play an important role in recovery for some patients with severe TBI.

Khariton<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>New York Presbyterian Queens,Surgery,Flushing, NY, USA <sup>2</sup>Weill Cornell Medical College,New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The majority of trauma centers utilize a two-tiered trauma activation system based on physiologic derangement and mechanism of injury. Geriatric patients are especially at risk for poor outcomes due to frailty, anticoagulant use, and polypharmacy.&nbsp; As part of an internal quality improvement (QI) project, we instituted a third trauma activation tier (Delta), triggered for geriatric patients with polypharmacy or anticoagulant use who did not meet traditional trauma activation criteria. A Delta activation triggers an immediate evaluation by a surgical resident. Our primary objective was to examine the effect of Delta activations on undertriage rates in geriatric trauma patients. Furthermore, we reviewed the effects of earlier identification and management for injured patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We conducted a retrospective review of the first two years after the establishment of the Delta activation system using the previous year, where these patients were assessed as trauma consults, as a historical control. All trauma patients over 65 were included. Outcomes included number of activations, time and location of disposition, and under-triage rates. Under-triage for Bravo and Delta activation was defined as death in the Emergency Department or admission to the operating room directly from the trauma bay.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Under-triage rates for trauma consults (historic control) vs. Delta activations decreased from 15% to 2.2% (p &lt;0.001).&nbsp; Time to disposition for consults vs. Deltas decreased by 2.2 hours (p &lt;0.001).&nbsp; ICU admissions increased from 4.1% to 6.2% (p&lt;0.001). Trauma Bravo activation rates decreased from 28% to 13% of all traumas (p &lt;0.001). Under-triage rates were stable, from 9% to 9% (p&gt;0.9).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;A three-tier trauma activation system is effective in reducing undertriage rates and allowing for earlier identification of injury in geriatric trauma patients. Furthermore, this improves trauma team resource utilization by decreasing time spent in the ED.

Patients with severe hemorrhage managed with mass transfusion protocol (MTP) are at risk of post-transfusion citrate-induced hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia. While ionized calcium (iCa) has been shown to be a predictor of mortality in MTP patients, here we evaluate the interaction of potassium (K), ionized calcium (iCa), and the K/iCa ratio as predictors of mortality in patients with severe hemorrhage receiving MTP.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This was a retrospective review of adult trauma patients from 2014-2019 who received MTP within one hour of arrival to a Level 1 trauma center. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the predictive capacity of iCa and the K/iCa ratio on mortality. The coordinate points on the ROC curve were used to establish a K/iCa ratio cut-off value by optimizing the Youden index. To identify the effect of K/iCa on survival, Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis and Cox regression models were used.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among 531 MTP patients, 146 met inclusion criteria. Patients who expired had higher K/iCa ratios than those who survived (median[IQR]= 5.7[3.8-7.2] vs 3.7[3.1-4.9], p &lt;0.001). In the ROC curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting mortality by K/iCa (AUC=0.72 [95% CI 0.62 - 0.82], p &lt;0.001) was larger than that of iCa alone (0.66 [95% CI 0.56 &ndash; 0.76], p &lt;0.01). In the K/iCa ROC curve, an optimal cutoff value of 5.09 was identified, with a sensitivity of 63.2% and specificity of 78.7%. A KM survival curve revealed that high K/iCa ratio was a strong prognostic marker for mortality (p &lt;0.001). Cox regression demonstrated a significant association between K/iCa ratio and mortality (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07&ndash; 1.23, p &lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
These findings demonstrate that an elevated K/iCa ratio in trauma patients managed with MTP is a better mortality predictor than iCa alone. During early MTP, K levels should be closely monitored in relation to iCa levels. Further validation of this prognostic marker is needed.

Trauma patients have high rates of recidivism and non-adherence, which may lead to poorer outcomes and further injury. However, these patients may not understand their injuries or who is caring for them, making recovery difficult. We hypothesized that trauma patients would not know 1) what their injures were or 2) which medical teams (MT) were involved in their care. We also hypothesized that 3) reported health literacy (HL) level would correlate with such knowledge.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a prospective study of awake, alert, and oriented trauma inpatients &gt;18 years admitted &gt;2 days. Participants completed a survey to 1) identify injured body regions (IBR), 2) recall MT, and 3) complete a validated HL questionnaire in which they reported their comfort with understanding health information (Figure 1). MT included medical and surgical specialists, as well as allied health professionals. Participant surveys (PS) were compared with the medical record (EMR) for IBR and MT. We used Cohen&rsquo;s kappa score to assess agreement between PS and EMR with &kappa;&lt;0.5 indicating poor agreement.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 50 participants, 32% did not identify &ge;50% of IBR and 8% did not identify &ge;75% of IBR. Most commonly missed IBR were skin (32%, &kappa;=0.2) and spine (20%, &kappa;=0.5). 42% could not identify &ge;50% of their MT and 28% could not identify &ge;75% of MT. Most commonly missed teams were nutrition (72%, &kappa;=0.0), occupational therapy (60%, &kappa;=0.1), and social work (60%, &kappa;=0.1). 50% of patients reported a HL score &gt;15, indicating confidence in their HL.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Many trauma patients were unable to identify their injuries or care team members despite high self-reported health literacies. The discrepancy between patient knowledge and patient injuries demonstrates the importance of interventions to improve health literacy, which may help with downstream outcomes and prevention of further injury.

Early excision and grafting and advances in antimicrobial dressings have improved patient outcomes. The judicious use of systemic antibiotics to treat infected burn wounds and sepsis is essential for burn patients. However, the use of routine perioperative antibiotics is debated. Perioperative antibiotics may alter the patient microbiome and promote resistance without improving outcomes. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of perioperative antibiotics on burn wound bacterial microbiome and clinical outcomes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients with uncomplicated thermal burns of &lt;10% TBSA expected to require a single grafting procedure were eligible for enrollment. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of weight-based cefazolin on induction of anesthesia or no antibiotics, which is our standard-of-care. Blood, saliva, wound biopsies, and swabs were collected before and after wound excision for quantitative culture and microbiome (16S rRNA) analysis. Repeat samples were collected at the first dressing takedown (1-3 days post-grafting), and first follow-up visit postoperatively (7-10 days post-discharge).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Demographics and injury characteristics are presented in Table 1 (n=28 patients). Median time between admission and operative intervention was 2 (IQR, 2-3) days. Patients who received antibiotics had significantly lower wound bed biopsy (0, IQR, 0-3.8x10<sup>3</sup> CFU/g vs. 7.0x10<sup>4</sup>, 0-2.5x10<sup>9</sup> CFU/g; p=0.02) and swab (0, 0-0 CFU/mL vs. 4.2x10<sup>2</sup>, 0-1.3x10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL; p=0.001) bacterial cultures compared to patients who did not receive antibiotics. There was no significant difference between groups on wound bed or donor site bacterial cultures intraoperatively or at follow up. There was one intraoperative post-excision biopsy and one swab that was culture positive in the antibiotics and no antibiotics group respectively. Groups did not differ significantly in rates of graft loss, postoperative infection, or %re-epithelialization at follow-up. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) revealed 31 enriched bacterial taxa within the wound beds of patients who received antibiotics based on dressing takedown samples (LDA &ge; 2, p &le; 0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Early excision and grafting and topical antimicrobials are effective at reducing the risk of burn wound infection. Perioperative antibiotics reduce wound bed bacterial colonization at the first postoperative dressing change but do not alter clinical outcomes. Microbiome analysis suggests that a single dose of perioperative antibiotics alters the wound bed microbiome, which may result in the enrichment of pathogenic bacteria.

To minimize unnecessary radiation exposure in a vulnerable population liberal use of computed tomography (CT) scanning in pediatric trauma patients should be avoided. The need for maxillofacial CT scanning in addition to head imaging to diagnose facial fractures is unclear. We hypothesized that maxillofacial CT scanning is over-utilized at our institution and rarely identifies clinically significant facial injuries not seen on head imaging.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

After IRB approval, we performed a single-center, retrospective study of patients identified from our trauma database. Subjects 18 years old and younger presenting to the hospital between January 2007 and December 2018 with both a head and maxillofacial CT scan were included. The following parameters were considered: age, date of injury, gender, injuries, indication for imaging, radiographic interpretation, and surgical intervention performed. A pediatric neuroradiologist interpreted the head and maxillofacial CT scans in a blinded fashion. Descriptive statistics were performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;

Of 63 cases identified with both head and maxillofacial CT scans, 48 patients (76%) had fully concordant reads, while 15 patients (24.0%) had an injury identified on maxillofacial CT not seen on head CT. Four patients underwent surgical intervention; all surgically significant injuries were identified on head CT, although 2 patients had their injuries better characterized by facial CT. Injuries identified on facial CT alone (not seen on head CT) included 4 nasal bone fractures and 10 orbital/ sinus fractures; all were non- or minimally-displaced and did not require surgical intervention.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Head CT evaluation is sensitive to screen for the majority of surgically significant facial fractures, eliminating the need for maxillofacial CT in most pediatric trauma patients. Facial CT scanning should be reserved for patients with suspected mandible fracture or extensive facial fractures requiring surgical planning. This approach would potentially reduce health care costs and radiation exposure in injured children.

Youth are tragically affected by violence.&nbsp; Justice-involved youth are at particularly high risk for the effects of violence, as incarceration serves as a risk factor.&nbsp; The objective of this study is to explore the risks and needs of justice-involved youth and identify channels for future hospital-based programming.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Four weekly focus groups were conducted by a credible messenger at the Douglas County Youth Center (DCYC) with former participants of Dusk 2 Dawn (D2D), a youth violence prevention program delivered at DCYC. 8 participants were prompted with preset interview questions in the domains of: basic awareness of violence, reasons for use of violence, responses to violence, awareness of protective and risk factors, participant experience with D2D, and future directions for youth programming in violence prevention. All focus groups were recorded and transcribed by a professional transcription service. A thematic analysis was performed by two independent coders to identify themes using Dedoose software.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The 3 most frequently&nbsp;occurring&nbsp;themes&nbsp;involved&nbsp;topics on&nbsp;protection, identified 40 times; family, identified 36 times; and the challenge of overcoming violence, identified 31 times. These themes often overlapped with one another, demonstrating how complex and integrated youth violence is. Participants&nbsp;described&nbsp;violence&nbsp;as an everyday&nbsp;occurrence and addressed&nbsp;the&nbsp;severe lack of protective people&nbsp;and&nbsp;places, both in their communities and homes.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Providing a safe and judgement-free space for the youth to discuss issues of violence was beneficial for three reasons: 1) inclusion of youth perspectives allows violence prevention program to be tailored to specific needs, 2) participants were able to deeply reflect on violence in their own lives and consider steps towards positive change, and 3) open communication encourages trust building and collaborative prevention efforts between the hospital and community. These lessons, coupled with intensive case management, will best address the needs identified in this analysis.

Ethnic minorities are less likely to receive post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation, TBI operative intervention, and are less likely to utilize outpatient clinical services after a TBI. A knowledge gap remains when examining pre and post-TBI utilization of these resources. We hypothesized that certain variables (age, gender, race, and type of insurance) play a role in healthcare utilization. We aim to study this relationship by examining percent change in cost as a measurement of healthcare utilization both before and after a TBI.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who had a moderate to severe TBI (Injury Severity Score ISS&gt;9) between 2014 and 2015 were identified in the Arkansas All Payer Claims Database. Patients with no healthcare claims the year prior to injury were excluded from the analysis. Healthcare costs were collected one year before injury and one year after discharge.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 5,684 patients with moderate to severe TBIs were identified, with an average percent cost increase of 27% post-TBI compared to pre-TBI. Age was inversely proportional to percent increase in cost. The lowest percent increase was found in ages 40-65 and 65+, with percent increases of 23.1% and 23.7% respectively, compared to 43% in population group 18-40 and 94.9% in patients &lt;18 (p=0.023). Medicaid insurance was also found to be a predictor of a larger change in percent cost, with a 55.3% increase in percent cost (p=0.001). Both length of stay and severity of TBI were associated with an increase in percent cost. Each day spent in the hospital during the index admission led to a 5.44% incremental increase in post-injury healthcare costs (p&lt;0.001). Injury severity scores &gt;15 were associated with a 39.2% increase in percent cost compared to a 23.5% increase in patients with ISS scores 9-15 (p&lt;0.001). Race and gender were not associated with any significant changes in percent increase. In Hispanic and Black populations, there was a percent increase of 29.7% and 18.3% respectively, compared to a percent increase of 28.1% in whites (p=0.983). In female populations, there was an observed percent increase of 24.0% compared to males, with a percent increase of 33.3% (p=0.086).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Healthcare costs increase for most patients after a moderate-to-severe TBI. There is a significant increase in percent cost in younger populations (&lt;18 and 18-40), who likely utilize healthcare services less overall prior to their injury compared to older populations (40-65 and 65+). The larger change in percent cost in Medicaid patients likely indicates that they have fewer healthcare claims prior to their injury compared to patients with medicare and private insurance. Additionally, as expected, both length of stay and severity of injury were associated with significant increases in percent cost. In our study, race and gender were not associated with significant differences in increases in percent cost after TBI.

Jansen<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Traumatic injuries remain one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Patients who survive traumatic injuries but return to the emergency department with repeat injuries are part of a phenomenon known as injury recidivism. Numerous studies have described trends in injury recidivism using registry and survey data. No prior study has leveraged electronic medical record (EMR) data to characterize injury recidivism. The EMR is more comprehensive as it contains details of patients who visited the emergency department after injury but did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the trauma registry. Such injuries could be predictive of future recidivism. We therefore aimed to describe patterns of injury recidivism seen at a large academic medical institution&nbsp;that has a Level 1 trauma center using the EMR.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective review was conducted of all injury-related encounters between January 2016 and December 2019. Encounter data including mechanism of injury and time to repeat injury was extracted from the EMR; trauma-specific characteristics (e.g., Injury Severity Score) were derived from the trauma registry. Manual review was conducted of all recidivistic encounters with &lt;11 months between encounters. As a person could have multiple index encounters, a general estimating equation logistic regression (to account for clustering by person) was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the association between recidivism and injury mechanism of the index encounter. Models were adjusted for age, race, sex, and insurance payor.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Among 20,279 index encounters, 6.8% (n=1,387) had a recidivistic encounter during the study period, over half of which (n=807) occurred within the first year of the index encounter. Compared to those experiencing an unintentional injury, patients presenting with an assault injury had a 42% (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.22-1.66) greater odds of returning with repeat injury (all-cause) and an over three-fold increased likelihood of a recidivistic assault injury (OR 3.06, 95% CI 2.35-3.99). For all-cause injury, when compared to unintentional MVCs, the three strongest associations observed for a recidivistic visit were blunt assaults (OR 2.53, 95% CI 2.03-3.15), falls (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.76-2.52), and self-harm injuries (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.00-3.23).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our study found that patients with assault injuries have the highest odds of injury recidivism&nbsp;and&nbsp;assault-related recidivistic encounters.&nbsp;These results&nbsp;demonstrate the feasibility and utility of incorporating EMR data, and suggest that the development of targeted interventions focused on mitigating assault injuries, such as hospital-based violence intervention programs, should be considered in our region.

Stey<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Feinberg School Of Medicine - Northwestern University,Surgical Outcomes Quality Improvement Center,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Differences in time to diagnostic and therapeutic measures by gender have been observed in medical acute care settings; published literature has further suggested these differences may contribute to disparities in outcome. Evaluations of process and outcome measures by gender for trauma have not yet been examined. We sought to investigate whether gender-based differences in triage time and time to definitive interventions existed for trauma patients in the United States.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The 2013-2016 Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) database was examined to evaluate traumatic brain injury (TBI), intra-abdominal injury (IAI), pelvic fracture (PF), and femur fracture (FF). Patients were stratified by injury severity score (ISS) and injury type. Primary outcomes included time to venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, time in prehospital care and triage, and time to intervention of specific injuries.&nbsp;Comparison of time to interventions by gender were conducted using Wilcoxon Rank sum tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
1513 patients with TBI (0.2%), 24,206 patients with IAI (2.4%), 53,485 patients with PF (5.3%) and 184,295 patients with FF (18.3%) were observed over the study period.&nbsp; Of patients with ISS &gt;= 15, 67.7% were men and 32.3% were women, with the average age being 42.7(&plusmn;18.0) and 48.4(&plusmn; 21.2) years old, respectively. Women had a significantly longer prehospital time (median 51.0 min vs 48.0 min, p&lt;0.05), emergency department (ED) length of stay (median 188.0 min vs 161.0 min, p&lt;0.05) and an increased wait time for femur fracture fixation (median 2.0 days vs 1.0 day, p&lt;0.05) compared to men. Time to VTE prophylaxis, time to angiography, time to TBI intervention, time to IAI intervention, and time to PF intervention did not differ significantly between genders (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Gender differences exist for trauma patients in prehospital time, ED length of stay, and in time to femur fracture fixation. Further investigations into system processes contributing to these disparities may aid in increasing efficacy of care provided to trauma patients in the United States.&nbsp;

Maung<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine,Department Of Surgery,New Haven, CT, USA <sup>2</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine,Division Of General Surgery, Trauma, And Surgical Critical Care,New Haven, CT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The American College of Surgeons mandates that at least 80% of trauma evaluations be screened for alcohol use. Although there are multiple screening methods, the serum blood alcohol content (BAC) is a quantifiable measure that can be easily included with other routine lab testing. However, given the need for clinician discretion in choosing a screening method, it is unclear whether screening with BAC is applied uniformly to all sociodemographic groups. We studied the national practice patterns of obtaining a BAC across race, ethnicity and sex groups

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Utilizing the 2017 Trauma Quality Programs Participant User File (TQP PUF), we examined the rates of BAC screening in adults across different demographic groups including race, ethnicity, and sex. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratios for receiving a BAC based upon these demographic factors adjusted for hospital and clinical factors.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 768,009 adult patients included in the study, 353,763 (46.1%) were screened with a BAC. Screening rates&nbsp;varied by age and injury mechanism with highest among motorcycle crashes, and lowest among falls. Overall, Asian, black, and &quot;other&rdquo; race had higher rates of alcohol screening than white patients, (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, Hispanic patients were screened at higher rates than non-Hispanic patients. In multivariable logistic regression, Asian race was associated with the highest odds of being screened (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.37-1.47) followed by other race (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.22 &ndash; 1.27) in comparison to white patients. Men were also more likely to be screened (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.43 &ndash; 1.46) than women.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There are significant differences in the rates of BAC testing among trauma patients across multiple sociodemographic factors. &nbsp;The propensity to obtain a BAC is disparate in terms of races and ethnicity, despite accounting for injury mechanism and substance use disorders. These findings may be suggestive of heightened scrutiny of racial and ethnic minorities by healthcare providers among patients injured by trauma.

Delayed or inadequate fasciotomy can lead to loss of function, muscle necrosis or limb loss. The objective of this study was to further delineate the association of fasciotomies and their timing in limb salvage after a penetrating vascular extremity injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Using the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study registry, a retrospective review of patients with penetrating arterial and/or venous extremity injuries from 2013 to 2017 was performed. Outcomes were compared in those with an early or late fasciotomy and those without fasciotomy.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 848 patients with penetrating vascular extremity injuries, 186 (21.9%) underwent a fasciotomy.&nbsp;Both injury severity scores (p&lt;0.0001) and abbreviated injury scales (p&lt;0.0001) were higher for those with a fasciotomy compared to those without.&nbsp;The femoral artery, femoral vein, popliteal artery, popliteal vein and ulnar artery were the most prevalently injured vessels in the fasciotomy cohort (p&lt;0.0001). Those with a fasciotomy had a higher rate of amputation compared to those without (p&lt;0.01). All of the patients who had an amputation after fasciotomy underwent a combined open and endovascular procedure and had a higher complication (p=0.0002)&nbsp;and mortality rate (p=0.0018) when compared to those without amputation.&nbsp;Additionally, those who had fasciotomy more than 7 hours after injury had a higher rate of amputations (p=0.029) and complications (p=0.029) compared to those who had fasciotomy less than 7 hours after injury.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients who required fasciotomies following penetrating vascular extremity injuries had higher rates of complications, including amputation, especially when performed in a delayed fashion respective to the initial injury. Early fasciotomy should be considered, where appropriate, in penetrating vascular extremity injuries.

Geriatric Trauma (GT) has a increasing incidence in trauma centers. We sought to understand the relationship of a trauma centers geriatric experience and mortality outcome in moderate and severely injured patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) from 2015 was used to examine trauma centers geriatric experience qualified into tertiles by percentage of geriatric admissions (age&gt;65) to total number of trauma admissions. GT patients were also sorted by minor (ISS&lt;8), moderate (ISS 9-15) and severely (ISS&gt;16) injuries.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Overall mortality is 6.5% with minor, moderate and severely injured mortality (2.2%, 4.4% &amp; 15.6%), respectively. Table 1 demonstrates mortality by admit percentage. Multilogistic regression in minor injured patients showed upper third hospitals (&gt;41.3% GT admissions) had improved survival OR .82 p= 0.025 CI .70- .97. Moderate injured GT patients showed no survival benefit by hospital admit %, while severely injured patients admitted to middle (30.9-41.2%) and upper third hospitals had associated decreased mortality OR .92 p= 0.013 CI .86-.98 &amp; OR .83 p&lt;0.001 CI .77-.89, respectively.



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
There are significant variations in GT mortality, especially noted in the severely injured GT patient. These patients appear to have a survival advantage when admitted to a trauma center that has a higher percentage of GT admissions. Whether this is by GT admission protocol, experience of physicians or a combination of both, lends credence to a dedicated GT center initiative for tertiary trauma referrals in the severely injured GT patient.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the utilization of autopsy for trauma deaths at an urban, level I trauma center and identify opportunities for optimization of this resource.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All autopsy reports from 2007 to 2016 of trauma patients were reviewed and categorized based on the level of autopsy examination performed, with A referring to a complete autopsy of a complex case and D referring to an external examination only. We hypothesized that autopsy is underutilized, potentially leading to underestimation of injury severity.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
During the 10-year study period, there were 614 deaths, with only 285 (46%) undergoing an autopsy. The median age was 45 years, 77% were male and the median ISS was 27. The most common mechanism of injury was gunshot wound (21%). Most deaths occurred in the ICU (38%), followed by the ED (35%). Of the autopsies performed, 33% were category A, 18% B, 1% C, and 46% D. Compared to all other autopsy categories (A, B and C), D autopsies were associated with a significantly lower injury severity score (26 vs. 37, p&lt;0.01), although these deaths were equally likely to occur in the OR (12% vs. 15%, p=0.58).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The majority of trauma deaths at a level I trauma center do not undergo an autopsy and for those that do, most include only an external examination. Optimal use of this resource may result in improved estimation of injury severity and contribute further to the process of performance improvement and patient safety.

In the face of barriers such as cost, LKD inconvenience, and the burden of data collection, they lack the tools to improve LKD engagement. To address this critical health system failure, we built the mKidney&reg; System based on input elicited from LKDs, transplant providers, and thought leaders in the field of transplantation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Key features of the mKidney&reg; System include a HIPAA-compliant patient-facing smartphone app and transplant provider-facing web portal, automated short message service (SMS) text messages, email, and push notifications, and data export functionality. We are conducting an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of the mKidney&reg; System on rates of post-donation follow-up, in preparation for a fully-powered multi-site clinical trial (NCT03400085). Participants are randomized to the intervention (mKidney&reg; System) or control arm (standard of care) using block randomization, and follow-up compliance is tracked over time (Figure). Follow-up compliance is ascertained through linkage to national registry data (SRTR).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;To date, our pilot study population includes 270 participants; of whom, 204 have 6-month donor follow-up available from the SRTR registry. Clinical follow-up required for compliance was completed by 96/98 (97.96%) of participants in the mKidney&reg; arm vs 99/106 (93.40%) of participants in the control arm (Fisher exact p = .173).

Mihaylov<sup>1</sup>, T. Wrightson<sup>1</sup>, M. J. Mangus<sup>1</sup>, R. S. Mangus<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Indiana University School Of Medicine,Surgery, Transplant Division,Indianapolis, IN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Post-extubation dysphagia is common in liver transplant (LT) patients who are increasingly elderly, frail and sarcopenic. Dysphagia places these patients at higher risk for aspiration, infection and re-intubation. Also, dysphagia delays the introduction of a regular post-operative diet, which contributes to ongoing malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia. This study evaluates a large number of LT patients to determine the impact of dysphagia on post-LT outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This study is a retrospective analysis of all LT patients at a single center over a 10-year period. Study variables included any need for a speech / swallow evaluation in the pre- and post-transplant period. From 2016 to 2020, each patient was assessed for frailty using a 5m walk test and CT measures of muscle mass. This subset of patients is analyzed independently for post-operative dysphagia. Outcomes include post-transplant length of hospital stay and early and late patient survival.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 1315 first time LTs during the study period. There were 125 patients (10%) who required pre-LT swallow evaluation for dysphagia, and 361 (28%) who required post-LT evaluation. The incidence of post-LT swallow dysfunction was 23%, 7% mild/moderate and 16% severe. Predictors of swallow dysfunction included older age, higher MELD score, and worse sarcopenia. There was worse 1-year patient survival with increasing severity of dysphagia (95%, 94%, 87%; p=0.04). There was also increasing length of stay (8, 17, 29 days; p&lt;0.001). Any dysphagia was associated with a 3x longer length of hospital stay (8 vs 23 days; p&lt;0.001). The 5m walk test did not predict dysphagia, but patients with worse sarcopenia were more likely to have any dysphagia (p=0.07). Patient with any dysphagia had lower survival at 1-year (89% versus 95%, p=0.03) and at 10 years (by Cox regression).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Liver failure patients with dysphagia pre- and post-LT have worse clinical outcomes. Patients with dysphagia must be identified to implement protective measures to avoid aspiration and optimize peri-operative nutrition. Dysphagia is an independent marker for weakness and frailty in patients with liver failure.

A significant and not infrequent cause of higher morbidity in lung transplant recipients is post-operative bronchial anastomotic complications. In a large cohort, this study investigated two surgical techniques (interrupted vs continuous sutures) during bronchial anastomosis and compared survival and occurrence of post-operative bronchial complications.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Survival outcomes of 721 single-center lung transplant recipients over 8 years (Feb-2012 to Mar-2020) were compared by suturing techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous suturing technique was performed with 3/0 polypropylene suture on an SH needle.&nbsp;Interrupted suturing used the same technique for the membranous portion of the anastomosis and multiple interrupted 2/0 polypropylene sutures for the cartilaginous portion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical parameters and demographics were compared between groups. The two groups were compared for post-operative morbidity, including need for bronchial interventions or stent placement. Survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests between groups.&nbsp;Cox regression analysis was run for statistical significances with different variables (p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 721 patients, 429 received the continuous suture technique while 292 underwent interrupted. In the continuous group, post-operative bronchial complications occurred&nbsp;in 58 patients (13.5%), compared to 30 patients of the interrupted group (10%). Demographics and clinical parameters between the groups were: age (p=0.008), gender (p=0.643), race (p=0.268), etiology (p&lt;0.001), lung allocation score (p=0.031), body mass index (p=0.676), single versus double transplant (p&lt;0.0001), cardiopulmonary bypass&nbsp;on versus off (p&lt;0.0001), surgical approaches (p=0.011) median length of stay 15 days for interrupted, 18 for continuous (p=0.017).&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-operative complications (continuous vs interrupted) were: bronchial complications 58 vs 30 patients (p=0.187), usage of Veno-Venous or Veno-Arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation post-transplant 47 vs 18 patients (p=0.024). Kaplan-Meier curve showed better survival with interrupted suturing (p=0.0001). Cox regression analysis while controlling for significant variables showed interrupted was protective compared to running (hazard ratio=2.26 p=0.0009),&nbsp;confidence interval for continuous group (1.35,3.51), interrupted group (0.29,0.74). All other covariates did not significantly affect survival.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Although both techniques showed reasonable post-transplant outcomes, our study demonstrated superior survival and relatively fewer complications when using interrupted suturing technique vs continuous during bronchial anastomosis. Further long-term study of similar groups with similar long-term follow up should be performed to validate this effect.

Highly sensitized (HS) patients experience longer wait times for kidney transplantation despite prioritization by the Kidney Allocation System. DCD kidneys have been shown to decrease wait times for most patient populations. However, the concern for increased rejection during DGF has caused hesitancy in using DCD kidneys in HS patients. In this study we evaluate the outcomes of HS kidney transplant recipients who received a DCD kidney.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Kidney transplant recipients who received DCD organs from 2015-2018 were studied using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database. Patients were divided into three groups for data analysis; calculated panel-reactive antibody (cPRA) 0% (Group 1), 1-89% (Group 2), and 90-100% (Group 3). Data analysis was performed with the SPSS software. Survival analysis was performed using a Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier model.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
7,854 kidney transplant recipients received DCD kidneys. Patients were divided into three groups: cPRA 0% (n= 4,598), cPRA 1-89% (n= 2,233), and cPRA 90-100% (n= 1,023). There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics. The mean KDPI in Group 3 was lower compared to other groups (51% vs. 50% vs. 44%; p&lt;0.001).&nbsp;Rabbit antithymocyte globulin induction was used for most patients in each group (58% vs. 66% vs. 75%). The incidence of DGF was similar between the 3 groups (41% vs. 42%. vs. 43%; p= 0.45). A higher number of patients in Group 3 were treated for rejection within 12 months (4.2% vs. 4.1% vs. 6.1%; p=0.003). No differences in graft failure (7.1% vs. 7.1 % vs. 6.7%; p=0.905) and patient survival (95% vs. 95% vs. 96%; p=0.449) were noted between groups. A Cox regression model identified KDPI as a significant factor, independent of cPRA, impacting graft survival (OR 3.76; 95% CI: 2.61-5.41).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
DCD kidney transplantation provides HS patients with comparable long term graft survival with an acceptable incidence of treated rejection within 12 months. Notably, KDPI had a larger influence on graft survival than the recipient&rsquo;s cPRA. This study supports an increased use of DCD kidneys in HS patients.&nbsp;

As recipient acuity has increased in liver transplantation(LT), efforts to better identify factors that impact outcomes and predict futility are ever more important. Sarcopenia has been&nbsp;suggested as a potential risk-stratification tool in LT. However, its impact in high-acuity LT recipients remains unclear. There are no studies examining the impact of perioperative sarcopenic fluctuations in LT. We hypothesized that perioperative sarcopenic change may&nbsp;impact&nbsp;patient outcomes. We sought to examine&nbsp;perioperative sarcopenia fluctuations&nbsp;on&nbsp;LT outcomes in a high-acuity patients.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We retrospectively assessed sarcopenia by calculating skeletal muscle index (SMI) using patient height (m<sup>2</sup>) and&nbsp;cross-sectional area at L3 vertebrae&nbsp;(cm<sup>2</sup>) on CT scan. LT recipients with MELD&ge;35 at LT with a CT &le;30 days prior to LT and&nbsp;at 30-90 days after LT were included; patients with acute liver failure were excluded. The perioperative SMI changes (?SMI) were calculated from pre and&nbsp;post-LT SMI values. Patients were divided&nbsp;in&nbsp;two groups by median ?SMI value.&nbsp; Cox regression was used to identify prognostic factors for patient survival. [481 LTs, MELD&ge;35, 2012-2018, single center]

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

88 LTs met&nbsp;inclusion criteria (median MELD 41.1). The median ?SMI was -5.0 (-29.4 - +21.1 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>) (fig&nbsp;A). 88 patients were classified into two groups: ?SMI&lt;-5.0 (median ?SMI: -0.4, n=44) and ?SMI&gt;-5.0 (median ?SMI: -9.2, n=44) (fig&nbsp;B). Recipients with ?SMI&lt;-5.0 had significantly higher pre-LT SMI (35.4 vs 31.2 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;0.001) and lower post-LT SMI (26.0 vs 30.8 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;0.001). There were no differences in recipient or&nbsp;donor demographics. The ?SMI&lt;-5.0 group had a significantly higher rate of early allograft dysfunction (40.9 vs 20.5%, p=0.037). No differences were seen in post-LT re-operation, re-intubation, bacteremia, and length of hospital stay. Patients with ?SMI&lt;-5.0 had significantly inferior patient/graft survival (p=0.015, 0.017, respectively) (fig&nbsp;C). Multivariate analysis identified ?SMI&lt;-5.0 (HR: 2.938, p=0.048), long cold ischemia time (&ge;9h, HR: 7.332, p=0.008), HCV&nbsp;(HR: 5.614, p=0.001), and tracheostomy after LT (HR:9.218, p&lt;0.001) as negative&nbsp;prognostic factors for patient survival (fig D).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

This analysis illustrates the significant impact of perioperative SMI decrease on LT outcomes. This suggests the&nbsp;importance&nbsp;of&nbsp;focusing not only on pre-transplant skeletal muscle volume, but also on perioperative changes in SMI and aggressively address continued Post-LT sarcopenia.

Simultaneous liver-kidney transplant (SLK) is performed in cirrhotic patients with renal failure&nbsp;secondary to either chronic kidney disease (CKD) or sustained acute kidney injury (SAKI). We compared outcomes in patients who received a liver transplant to those qualifying for SLK.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We reviewed 219 adult liver transplants performed at our institution between October 1, 2012 and April 30, 2020. 79% were liver only&nbsp;(LT) and 21% were SLK. Patient characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. Median follow up was 34 months.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The LT and SLK groups were comparable in age, gender, and liver failure etiology. SLK patients had higher&nbsp;MELD scores (40 vs 22, p&lt;0.01) and longer pre-transplant ICU needs. Among patients who received SLK, the etiology of pre-transplant renal failure was 32% CKD and 68% SAKI (p&lt;0.01). 94% of SLK patients required renal replacement therapy (RRT) at the time of transplant versus 28% in the LT group (p&lt;0.01). Median time on RRT prior to transplant was longer in the SLK group&nbsp;at 28 days compared to 11 days in LT cohort&nbsp;(p&lt;0.01). 72% of SLK patients received intraoperative RRT versus 27% of LT patients (p&lt;0.01). At 1 year, 53% of surviving SLK patients and 57% of LT patients had normal kidney function (p=0.7). Liver graft survival was comparable in both groups. Patient survival was higher in LT group: 1 and 3-year survival of 92% and 80% versus 82% and 75% for SLK patients (p=0.04). 21% of SLK patients had a positive crossmatch. Among the 47 SLK patients, 5 (10.6%) developed death-censored renal graft loss:&nbsp;60% were due to refractory rejection within 6 months of transplant, all with positive crossmatch, while 40% were secondary to post-transplant acute tubular necrosis.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

High acuity cirrhotic patients are at increased risk of renal failure. Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation achieves acceptable patient outcomes and graft survival in critically ill patients. Pre-transplant cross matching for SLK candidates may play a role in renal graft outcomes and warrants further investigation.&nbsp;

Travel to, and within, the United States (US) has created four groups of patients who compete for liver transplantation: 1) singly listed (SL) patients who are listed at one transplant center, 2) multiply listed (ML) patients who are simultaneously listed at more than one center, 3) non-citizen, non-resident patients (NCNR) who travel to the US temporarily, and 4) non-citizen, residents (NC-R) who travel to and reside in the US. ML, NCNR, and NC-R travel for transplant is legal, but these practices raise concerns about the ethics of deceased donor organ allocation and whether our transplant system upholds social justice. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) enables patients to undergo transplantation without drawing from the limited deceased donor pool, offering both an ethical and practical solution to the problems of travel for transplantation. This study compared graft and patient survival following liver transplantation among SL, ML, NCNR, and NC-R recipients of both deceased donor (DDLT) and LDLT.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All United Network for Organ Sharing liver waitlist (WL) candidates from January 1, 2003-December 31, 2017 were reviewed. Re-transplant candidates, pediatric patients, and patients listed for multiple organs were excluded. SL patients were those with a single listing. ML patients were those with overlapping listing dates prior to their initial transplant or WL removal date. NCNR and NC-R patients were defined by citizenship. Demographics were compared using ANOVA and chi square tests. Graft and patient survival were evaluated using the Kaplan Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

132,277 WL registrants resulting in 75,955 liver transplant recipients were included (4.2% LDLT). Donor type by travel group is shown in Table 1. Among all recipients, there were significant differences in both graft and patient survival (p-values&lt;0.001), with NCNR and NC-R faring best and SL faring worst. In multivariable Cox models evaluating predictors of graft loss or patient survival, and including age, sex, MELD score, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, travel group, education, insurance, race, and donor type, LDLT was significantly associated with decreased graft loss (HR 0.9, p-value= 0.006) and decreased death (HR 0.79, p-value=0.001). Among LDLT recipients alone, there was no difference in graft or patient survival when stratified by travel group (p-values=0.69 and 0.36, respectively).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
LDLT represents a small proportion of all liver transplants performed in the US and must be carefully monitored to protect against donor exploitation, however this data suggests a more expanded use of LDLT should be considered for all patients.

Panichella<sup>1</sup>, A. Di Carlo<sup>1</sup>, S. Karhadkar<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Temple University,Surgery,Philadelpha, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996, HIV+ individuals are living longer. However, living longer has led to higher rates of end stage renal disease, therefore, kidney transplantation has become of increasing interest in this demographic. Renal allograft survival in HIV+ patients has lagged behind that of comparable cohorts and has been associated with increased rates of acute rejection. Additionally, increased rates of positive cross-matches in these recipients has impacted organ utilization. This study focuses on outcomes of kidney transplantation in HIV+ patients who are highly sensitized as described by a PRA value 90%-100% and/or with a positive cross match.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Data was gathered from the 2018 UNOS database, in which a total of 1530 HIV+ patients who received kidney transplants were selected. PRA values were grouped to create sensitization levels: non-sensitized (0%), low (1%-50%), medium (51%-89%), and highly sensitized (90%-100%). A demographics table was created to compare characteristics and outcomes between the four sensitization groups. A separate demographics table was created for non-sensitized and highly sensitized groups who also had a positive cross match.&nbsp;Subject characteristics were summarized using means and standard deviations or frequencies and percentages, as applicable. Significance between groups was determined by independent samples t-tests and &chi;<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>tests (&alpha; = 0.05.). Death-censored graft survival for various subgroups was estimated using Kaplan-Meier with Log-Rank to assess significance. All analysis was completed using SPSS Statistics 26.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The median graft survival for all 1530 patients is 792 days. The median graft survival for the non-sensitized group is 738 days while the median graft survival for the highly sensitized group is 990 days. The corresponding Kaplan-Meier graph displays no significant difference in the survival curves of the four groups; furthermore the highly sensitized group is the highest curve. The median graft survival for the non-sensitized group with a positive cross match is 2031 days while the median graft survival for the highly sensitized group with a positive cross match is 1606.5 days. The corresponding Kaplan-Meier graph displays that the survival curve of the highly sensitized group is slightly less than that of the non-sensitized group.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The results show that graft survival is comparable for the highly sensitized group compared to the non-sensitized group. Therefore, HIV+ patients with a PRA value &gt;= 90% should not be excluded from transplantation nor considered at higher risk when compared to non-sensitized HIV+ patients. The highly sensitized HIV+ patients with a positive cross match did exhibit a lower median graft survival, however, when comparing both the non-sensitized and highly sensitized to the overall study population, both groups had significantly higher median graft survival. Therefore a patient with a positive cross match or a positive cross match and highly sensitized should not be excluded from kidney transplantation nor considered at higher risk when compared to non-sensitized HIV+ patients with a negative cross match.

Uremic symptoms are an important patient-centered outcome that is unique to this population, yet pre- and post-KT changes in uremic symptoms have never been studied.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We leveraged a 2-center prospective study (n=2,531) of KT candidates (5/2014-3/2020). Uremic symptom scores (0-12) were calculated using KDQOL-36 items (pruritus, anorexia, and fatigue), and categorized: minimal:0-4; moderate:5-8; severe:9-12.&nbsp;We also estimated the risk of waitlist mortality (competing risks regression; n=1,289), change in uremic symptom scores between evaluation and transplantation (n=195), and the post-KT uremic symptom scores trajectories (mixed-effects models; n=545). All models were adjusted for confounders based on our conceptual models.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: At evaluation, 19.6% of candidates reported moderate symptoms and 4.5% reported severe uremic symptoms. Candidates with severe uremic symptoms were at elevated risk of waitlist mortality (aSHR=2.75, 95%CI:1.37-5.52). By KT, 10.3% experienced decline in uremic symptom severity, 17.4% experienced elevated severity, and 72.3% remained unchanged. The estimated average uremic symptom score was 2.49 points at KT, 0.82 points at 4 months (67% decline) and 1.15 points (54% decline) at 16 months post-KT; the score decreased 0.42 points/month (95%CI:0.36-0.47) during 0-4 months post-KT, while increased 0.03 points/month (95%CI:0.000-0.06) from 4 months through 16 months post-KT (Figure). All 3 of the individual uremic symptoms had significant declines in the first four months post-KT. The estimated pruritus score wat 0.80 at KT and declined to 0.04 at 4 month post-KT, reflecting a 95% decline at 4 months; patients reported a 65% decline in anorexia and 52% decline in fatigue.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Among KT candidates, severe uremic symptoms were associated with a greater risk of waitlist mortality. In this first longitudinal study of these patient-reported outcomes, we found that uremic symptoms persisted while on the transplant waitlist and significantly declined in the first 4 months post-KT. Or findings on the improvement of uremic symptoms with KT can help inform the shared-decision making surrounding transplantation.

Patients can have access to transplant centers through multiple interfaces, with online access to websites being one avenue. However, it is unknown if these websites provide equitable access to transplant center information. This study aimed to assess kidney transplant website language and literacy levels to determine how equitable they are to patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;United States kidney transplant center websites were identified from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Language was assessed by surveying the transplant kidney homepage and subpages for transplant-specific, non-English resources,&nbsp;excluding interpreter services. Literacy levels of kidney transplant website content were assessed by two tests: readability ease via the Flesch Reading Ease test and grade level via the Flesch Kincaid Grade Level test. Kidney transplant center websites from the 11 regions in the United States were compared to determine if transplant centers reflect their population demographics.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;227 kidney transplant centers were identified in the United States. Only 17% (38/227) of all kidney transplant center websites provided resources in non-English. Region 4 (OK, TX) and 5 (AZ, CA, NV, NM, UT) transplant center websites provided the most alternative language resources (14/57), whereas region 8 (CO, IA, KS, MO, NE, WY) and 10 (IN, MI, OH) did not providing any (0/34). Non-English resources provided did not reflect the respective state demographics or languages spoken at home. The variety in Spanish-provided resources included education PDF files and videos; external links to third-party sites in Spanish; and integrated translation systems. The average readability ease for all websites was 38&plusmn;12, ranging from 1 to 69 (scale 0-100, lower scores corresponding to greater reading difficulty). This matched grade level of kidney transplant websites, which averaged 12&plusmn;2.2, ranging from 7 (middle school) to 20 (professional).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Less than 20% of kidney transplant center websites provide some form of educational resources in an alternative language. In addition, transplant center websites&rsquo; literacy levels are 5 grades above the national average reading level of 7th grade. This inequity in understandability and literacy of transplant center websites further widen the gap in access to kidney transplantation. We hope to provide recommendations and guidelines to improve transplant center websites accessibility to better equip patients and their families with the knowledge and tools to make informed decisions regarding their transplant care.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A&nbsp;Markov decision analytic model (DATA 3.5, TreeAge Software, Inc, Williamstown MA) was create to estimate the impact of delaying kidney transplantation in the current pandemic setting.&nbsp; Base case patients in the model were defined as older patients (&gt; 65 years of age) as this describes the population which public health officials have ascribed with higher risk following COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on an assumed COVID-related mortality rate of 5.7%, immediate transplantation was associated with superior survival relative to 3, 6, 9, and 12 month delayed listing strategy.&nbsp; However, as significant uncertainty exists in regard the true COVID-19 mortality amongst the immunosuppressed transplant population, a sensitivity analysis was performed revealing that delay to transplant was a superior strategy only when the COVID-19 related mortality rate was &gt;10%.&nbsp;

DeBakey Department Of Surgery,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

For decades, transplantation has prolonged life for children with heart, liver, and kidney failure. Improvements in waitlist and post-transplant survival are well documented, but donor organ shortages and difficulties in predicting wait-times create persistent uncertainty for children and their families. An intent-to-treat analysis, measuring survival from listing to death regardless of whether a transplant is received, can provide a more patient-centered perspective through which progress can be examined. The primary aim of this study is to examine changes in intent-to-treat outcomes from 1987-2017 in children listed for heart, liver, and kidney transplant.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Retrospective analysis was performed on data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), including 12,511 children listed for heart transplant, 15,574 children listed for liver transplant, and 16,256 children listed for kidney transplant. Patients were separated based on era of listing from 1987-1992, 1993-1998, 1999-2004, 2005-2010, and 2011-2017. The 2011-2017&nbsp;era was used as the reference. For each organ, factors including patient age, weight, height, ethnicity, life support dependency, UNOS status 1 designation, and organ-specific diagnosis were subjected to a univariate Cox regression analysis of intent-to-treat survival. Variables significant in univariate analysis were included with era of listing in multivariate analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Results from multivariate analysis pertaining to era of listing are shown&nbsp;in Table 1. For all three organs, later era of listing was found to be associated with decreased risk of death. In the heart and liver portions of the analysis, listing in all four eras prior to the reference were found to be associated with increased risk. In&nbsp;the kidney portion of the analysis, listing in the era 2005-2010 was not found to be associated with increased risk of death.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Intent-to-treat survival is a function of waitlist and post-transplant survival in addition to transplantation rate. Significant progress has been made in prolonging intent-to-treat survival for children listed for heart, liver, and kidney transplant. This is in line with the significant efforts that have been dedicated to the treatment of end-stage organ failure and graft rejection as well as improvements in immunosuppressive therapy. Efforts to increase the donor-pool and minimize organ discard have also contributed to this success. Further organ-specific analysis is warranted to determine predictors of intent-to-treat survival in order to contribute to future progress.

This points to the need to efficiently identify marginal livers that are viable for transplant, especially as rates of obesity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcohol use, and hepatitis C continue to trend upwards. To this end, this study aims to evaluate the validity of existing non-invasive tests in predicting the extent of macrosteatosis in the deceased donor population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Deceased donor UNet IDs were utilized to link abstracted liver biopsy data from all donor liver biopsies in the 2010 to 2020 period to the SRTR and its extensive data on liver donors and recipients. Non-invasive tests were applied to the sub-populations of potential deceased liver donors in order to evaluate the validity of the NAFLD fibrosis score and BARD score at predicting liver macrosteatosis &gt;30%. Lab test values obtained for the patient population were compared to their biopsy results for diagnostic accuracy.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The NAFLD fibrosis score had a 60.1% sensitivity, 41.9% specificity, 12.2% positive predictive value, and 88.7% negative predictive value, while the values for the BARD score were 89.9%, 14.2%, 12.3%, and 91.1%.

For patients with TTR Amyloidosis, the only disease modifying treatment is an orthotopic liver transplant. However, because of the nature of the disease, the liver from this patient can then be safely donated to another patient in need. While current research already demonstrates the success of DLT and increase the donor organ pool for those in dire need of a transplant, the use of DLT in many transplant centers has been limited. Trepidation over outcomes and complications in low frequency DLT centers has discouraged hospitals from using this procedure. This study analyzes the performance outcomes (of the DLT recipient) of transplant centers with a high frequency of DLTs performed to that of centers with lower frequency of DLTs performed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplantation (OPTN) Standard Transplant Analysis and Research (STAR) database was queried and analyzed with SPSS version 26 IBM.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole liver domino patients&nbsp;&nbsp;were extracted from the living donor dataset of transplants performed between April of 1996 and January of 2018 (n=193). Quantitative data was recorded as a mean with a standard deviation, while qualitative data is recorded as a frequency and percentage of the population queried. A Kaplan-Meier curve was performed. High frequency centers were determined as those with more DLTs than the third quartile mark (&gt;5.75 DLTs performed).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Overall outcomes between low and high frequency DLT centers were very similar. There was no difference between types of centers in cardiac, respiratory, or renal failure as a cause of death. There was no difference in functional status at the last follow-up between the two types of centers. The Kaplan-Meier curve shows the allograft survival is similar between the two groups. Graft status at the time of the last follow-up showed 91.7% of grafts functioning in the low frequency centers compared to 86.5% of grafts functioning high frequency centers. Acute rejection and chronic rejection were shown to be a similarly low value between the groups (1.6% high frequency versus 1.5% low frequency).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The outcomes of high frequency DLT centers are very similar&mdash; if not better than&mdash;those of the low frequency centers. This encourages hesitant centers to perform DLTs without fear of outcomes or complications. Continued analysis to show significance are underway.&nbsp;

While the gender gap is narrowing, the unique experiences of women trainees must be assessed and integrated into training and recruitment strategies to ensure meaningful progress toward gender parity in the field of transplant surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A 38-question survey was distributed to candidate members of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons (ASTS) via the ASTS email listserv to assess medical school and residency training experiences and exposure to transplant surgery, as well as career and academic mentorship received as trainees. Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to determine statistical significance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 324 ASTS candidate members contacted, 94 (29% response rate) completed the survey and 37% of participants self-identified as women. In medical school, 61% of men and 48% of women had exposure to transplant surgery. At the start of residency training, men rated their interest in transplant surgery significantly higher with a median score of 6.5 (6) compared to women with a median score of 4.0 (6) (p&lt;0.05) on a rating scale of 1 = not interested, to 10 = very interested. At the start of their senior/chief years of training, both men and women rated their interest in transplant surgery equally (10 [1] and 10 [2] respectively). Most women (53%) and men (57%) senior residents had greater than one month of clinical exposure to transplant surgery at their home program and qualified their operative experience as excellent or good (94%; 76%). Most women and men trainees also felt supported by the transplant faculty at their institutions, both in their dedicated research time (68%; 63%) and during their fellowship application cycle (74%; 78%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: To date, a gender gap persists in transplant surgery. Women trainees report less interest in transplant surgery in their junior years and the survivorship bias from the cross-sectional study design may underestimate&nbsp;the magnitude of this finding. Although this difference is not reported in their senior years compared to their male counterparts, early career engagement of women trainees may provide an avenue to reduce the current gender gap. Women trainees have similar training experiences, exposure to transplant surgery, and career and academic mentorship later in their training compared to men trainees. More organized and targeted mentorship, including supportive relationships with transplant surgeons early in trainees&#39; careers and positive junior transplant surgery experiences, are needed to promote engagement in transplant surgery among women trainees.

There is increasing concern regarding the attrition of surgeon-scientists in cardiothoracic (CT) surgery. However, the distinguishing characteristics of CT surgeons who lead both basic science research (BSR) and clinical research (CR) have not been previously examined in comparison to CT surgeons who only lead CR. We hypothesized that early exposure to BSR during training and active grant funding are important factors that facilitate the pursuit of BSR among practicing CT surgeons. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

Methods

We created a database of all 992 CT surgeons listed as faculty at accredited United States CT surgery teaching hospitals in 2018. Data regarding each surgeon&rsquo;s training/professional history, publication record, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding were acquired from publicly available online sources. Continuous data are presented as median with interquartile range and analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical data are presented as counts with percentages and analyzed with Fisher&rsquo;s exact test.

&nbsp;

Results

Of the 992 CT surgeons in our database, 672 (67.7%) published a first- or last-author paper in 2017-2018 and were thus considered active in research. Of these 672 surgeons, 73 (10.9%) published a first- or last-author BSR paper in addition to CR in 2017-2018, while 599 (89.1%) published a first- or last-author paper only in CR in 2017-18 (Table 1). The surgeons in both groups represent a similar era (start year as an attending: 2006 [1995-2009] vs 2005 [1996-2011], respectively, p=0.403). However, only 2 women faculty in CT surgery published a first- or last-author BSR paper in 2017-2018. A similar majority of surgeons in both groups attended a top 25 NIH-funded institution during training (74.0% vs 71.8%, p=0.783) and pursued a protected research fellowship during training (69.9% vs 61.3%, p=0.162), but surgeons who are actively leading BSR are more likely to have earned a PhD degree (20.5% vs 9.7%, p=0.005), more likely to have published a first-author BSR paper during training (76.7% vs 40.9%, p&lt;0.001), and more likely to have been a co-author on a BSR paper during training (83.6% vs 58.9%, p&lt;0.001). Surgeons who are actively leading BSR are also more likely to currently be funded by an NIH grant (34.2% vs 5.8%, p&lt;0.001), especially an NIH R01 grant (21.9% vs 2.5%, p&lt;0.001).

&nbsp;

Conclusions

A great minority of CT surgeons at academic teaching hospitals are actively leading basic science research. In order to facilitate the development of future CT surgeon-scientists, additional support must be given to trainees interested in pursuing basic science research, especially among women and those who did not pursue an MD PhD degree.&nbsp;

This study aims to gauge potential for robotic advances in the context of surgical education by assessing resident perspectives of robotic surgical education and overall career utility.



<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  General surgery residents from 3 residency programs of diverse hospital type and geographic location were surveyed using mixed-methods questions that addressed robotic surgery experience and intraoperative autonomy on the robot. Descriptive statistics were utilized.



<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Forty-three categorical general surgery residents participated (RR=50.6%): 23.3% were senior residents (PGY4-5), 32.6% mid-level residents (PGY3), and 44.2% junior residents (PGY1-2). 58.1% (n=25) of all participants indicated anticipation that they would use robotic surgery in future careers, despite most (n=32, 74.4%) indicating that robotic cases only comprised 10% or less of their major cases in the past year. In terms of exposure and intraoperative experience, mid-level (n=4, 28.6%) and senior residents (n=4, 40%) indicated they actually had been able to operate a robotic console for an entire case up to this point, with equal numbers of single versus dual console operations.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Enhancements to the operative experience provided by the robot lend themselves well to advancing surgical education; though, perhaps due to the novelty associated with robotic surgery, strategies around robotic resident education and intraoperative autonomy lag behind other surgical approaches, as the proportion of cases may suggest. This pilot survey demonstrates that residents do anticipate utility of robotic surgery and seek experience by senior level. Using this information, further studies will evaluate best practices of robotic teaching toward autonomy, focused on the context of single versus dual console models.

Modrall<sup>1</sup>, M. Kirkwood<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,Department Of Vascular Surgery,Dallas, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
There are currently three accredited pathways to train vascular surgeons. In 2003, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) approved the Early Specialization (ESP)Track (4+2) for general surgery residents pursuing a career in Vascular Surgery and in 2005 approved the integrated (0+5) vascular programs for matriculated medical students. Over the past decade there has been a shift in integrated vascular surgery residents outnumbering traditional 5+2 fellowships. Previous studies have shown that the integrated programs (0+5) have no negative impact on the vascular training experience of general surgery residents nor vascular surgery fellows. Currently no studies exist evaluating the impact of the Vascular ESP track. The purpose of our study is to examine if the implementation of the Vascular ESP track had a significant impact on the operative vascular surgery experience of general surgery residents at our institution.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Using the ACGME operative case log reporting system, we retrospectively collected the total cumulative major vascular surgery cases completed by all graduating chief residents at the completion of their residency from the academic years of 2003 to 2019. Only cases reported as &ldquo;surgeon chief&rdquo; and &ldquo;surgeon junior&rdquo; were included. We compared operative experience before and after starting our Vascular ESP track in July 2005.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 186 general surgery chief residents graduated from 2003 to 2019. Prior to starting the Vascular ESP between 2003 to 2005 the average major vascular surgeries cases logged by graduating chiefs was 85.6&plusmn;9.91 (range, 64-112) amongst 24 graduates. From 2006 to 2019, the average cases completed was 110.8&plusmn;21.9 (range, 56-372) amongst 162 graduates. (P 0.016). Interestingly, between 2003-2009 there was no significant difference in case volume however after 2009, there was a significantly increased number of reported vascular surgery cases by general surgery residents as seen by a 40% increase in case logs.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Similar to the Integrated Vascular surgery residency, after the institution of the Vascular Early Specialization Track, there was no negative impact on the operative vascular surgery experience of general surgery residents.

Much of current surgical patient education materials (PEMs) are difficult to understand. We investigated and tested a method to improve surgical PEMs and understanding.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We utilized informational design with a professional artist to iteratively re-design the PEM for one surgery: sigmoidectomy. The CARP technique was used (contrast, alignment, repetition and placement) to create a one-page PEM. We presented the new PEM to 12 patients and family members. Participants were administered surveys including the BRIEF health literacy instrument to compare and quantify understanding between old and new PEMs.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Using informational design with CARP, a new single-page PEM was constructed to show the steps and strategies used to resect and reconstruct the intestines during a sigmoidectomy. We recruited 12 participants to test the new PEM: 8 patients and 4 family members. Participant age range was 17-83 years with an average of 51.2 years. 38% of patients had limited health literacy by BRIEF and 50% were female. All participants understood and preferred the new PEM. All participants agreed that everyone or most people could understand the new PEM (vs. old PEM). Only 3 out of 12 participants agree that the old PEM could be understood by most people. No patients thought the old PEM could be understood by everyone. Over 50% of all participants stated that the new PEM: 1) captured their attention 2) helped them understand the procedure 3) informed them on how to prepare for their surgery 4) broke down steps to clear up their understanding of the surgical journey and 5) avoided confusion.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Using informational design with CARP, a more acceptable and understandable PEM on sigmoidectomy was constructed. The new PEM was accepted and understood by all individuals including those with limited health literacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Advancing from training to clinical practice, surgeons must begin their attending careers in private practice or academia. It is unclear, however, if surgeons can transition to academia if private practice is initially selected. Here, we examined the research experience of academic cardiothoracic (CT) surgeons who began their attending careers in private practice.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We created a database of all 992 academic CT surgeons at the 77 CT surgery training institutions in the United States in 2018. Data regarding professional history, research productivity, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding were obtained from institutional webpages, Scopus, and Grantome. Institutional rankings by NIH funding were obtained from the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools. Continuous data are presented as median with interquartile range and analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical data are analyzed with Fisher&rsquo;s exact test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

80/992 (8.1%) surgeons started their careers in private practice while 912/992 (91.9%) started in academia. Surgeons who began in private practice spent 7.0 [3.0-13.0] years in private practice, publishing 0.3 [0.1-0.8] papers per year during private practice and 0.8 [0.2-2.1] papers per year during their subsequent academic career (p=0.0020).

The research backgrounds of those who began their careers in private practice versus academia were similar (Table 1). Surgeons who started in private practice were as likely to have earned a PhD degree (p=0.4232) and NIH funding at any point in their careers (p=0.2375) as surgeons who started in academia. During training, surgeons who began in private practice were also as likely to take dedicated time for research (56.3% vs 57.0%, p=0.9067) and co-author a basic sciences publication (50.0% vs 54.5%, p=0.4832). Furthermore, a comparable proportion of surgeons who started in private practice trained at a top-20 NIH funded institution for general surgery residency (p&gt;0.9999) and CT fellowship (p=0.3398). Despite these similarities, surgeons who began in private practice published fewer total papers at the end of general surgery residency (2.0 [0.0-5.0] vs 4.0 [0.0-10.0], p=0.0040) and CT fellowship (3.0 [1.0-8.0] vs 7.0 [2.0-14.0], p=0.0001). Surgeons who began in private practice were also less likely to have published a paper in 2017 or 2018 (55/80 [68.8%] vs 807/912 [88.5%], p&lt;0.0001) and to currently work at a top-20 NIH funded institution (17/80 [21.3%] vs 325/912 [35.6%], p=0.0097).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Transitioning from private practice to academia is an established pathway. Surgeons who begin as attendings in private practice exhibit a similar research background as those who begin in academia but are less likely to publish research.

Faruqi<sup>1</sup>, V. Suresh<sup>1</sup>, A. A. Sonkar<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>King George's Medical University,Department Of General Surgery,Lucknow, UTTAR PRADESH, India","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Little work exists worldwide on the objective&nbsp;institutional preference of top medical students and graduates (MSGs) selected for surgical&nbsp;residencies, who represent the future of surgery. Since 2017, India has been having a single annual test for MSGs.&nbsp;Ranks here&nbsp;serve&nbsp;as the sole criterion for selection into residency at nearly all training institutions. The latter lack&nbsp;any say in selecting individual MSGs. High-ranking candidates on this exam, the national eligibility-cum-entrance test - postgraduation (NEET-PG),&nbsp;represent the best&nbsp;MSGs in India. However,&nbsp;no study has yet determined the institutions most preferred for general surgery training, for which there are 3663 positions annually available. Hence, we sought to determine the institutional preference for residency of top-ranking MSGs who chose general surgery via NEET-PG.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We utilized the Medical Council of India (MCI) database of accredited training institutions and the&nbsp;anonymized, publicly available NEET-PG&nbsp;database of rank list and&nbsp;seat selection from 2017-20. We analyzed data of the top-100 ranked MSGs who chose general surgery every year from the round-one seat-selection session during 2017-20. We correlated this to the data of the national ranking of healthcare institutions (NIRF) published annually by the Government of India.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

India currently has 331 accredited&nbsp;3-year programs in general surgery, with median (IQR) number of seats being 10 (10). We found significant clustering of top 400 MSGs who chose surgery into a few residency programs (figure 1). The overall distribution was heavily skewed, with&nbsp;53.5% of the top MSGs preferring residency&nbsp;at just 7 institutions. These were&nbsp;amongst&nbsp;the 39 that were represented in the choices. Despite the&nbsp;complete absence&nbsp;of visiting student rotations in India, we found that a select few institutions consistently were the most preferred across all years. We discovered that preferred institutions were overwhelmingly located in major metropolitan cities&nbsp;and their degree of preference did not correlate well with their institutional&nbsp;ranking. The 2 most preferred institutions were&nbsp;absent from the government rankings across all 4 years.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

We report for the first time the&nbsp;objective institutional preferences of top MSGs&nbsp;for general surgery residency in India. With a lack of visiting rotations, MSGs&nbsp;lack the means to&nbsp;compare programs. Additionally, there exists a need to determine the best practices from the preferred institutions&nbsp;and incorporate them&nbsp;at others. Top MSGs&nbsp;definitively prefer training in large metropolitan cities even though the institution may not be highly ranked, indicating that location is perhaps a key factor in selection. A multicentric, pan-India survey&nbsp;is needed to&nbsp;determine the reasons behind these preferences.

We assessed the impact of COVID-19 on student engagement (in the United States and internationally) in global surgery webinars.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Thirteen open-access webinars were held by a global surgery nonprofit between October 2019 and July 2020 consisting of expert panels and addressing various global surgery topics. Webinars were divided based on pre- or post-pandemic declaration by the WHO (pre: 10/2019-02/2020, post: 04/2020-07/2020) and registration&nbsp;form responses were divided based on the registrant&rsquo;s country of residence (US vs. non-US). The average differences in overall registration rates, diversity of countries represented, and US vs. non-US engagement were analyzed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Webinars following the pandemic showed an overall increase in average number of registrants, though this difference was not significant (63.0 vs. 118.3, p=0.15). The average number of US registrants was significantly higher than the average number of non-US registrants during the pre-pandemic era (40.3 vs. 22.7, p=0.01), a between-group difference that equalized during the COVID19 pandemic (76.3 vs. 41.3, p=0.08). Despite an average increase in non-US participants, the increase in countries represented was not statistically significant (15.7 vs. 19.7, p=0.49). Webinars addressing broad disciplinary topics had the highest number of registrants, including&nbsp;global neurosurgery (n=194) and global obstetrics/gynecology (n=202). Conversely, the webinar with the most non-US registrants focused on research editorials, a very specific topic in global surgery (n=101).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Global surgery webinars were free and highly attended by students from high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Webinars held after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with increased participation from both US and international learners, particularly among non-US participants. This suggests an increased interest in global surgery topics among students during the pandemic, as well as unique opportunities to increase international collaboration in academic global surgery.

Integrated residencies allow direct entry into surgical subspecialties, enabling residents to bypass general surgery residency and save two or more years in training.&nbsp; Although the number of integrated residencies continues to increase, little is known about the impact of this new training paradigm on trainee wellness.&nbsp; Our aim is to compare resident well-being between integrated (0+5) and traditional (5+2) vascular surgery training paradigms in the United States.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
An optional, confidential survey was administered after the 2020 Vascular Surgery In-Training Exam. &nbsp;Clinically-active integrated residents (PGY 4-5) and fellows (PGY 6-7) were asked their perceptions about aspects of their learning environment, as well as thoughts of leaving their program or changing to a different specialty within the past academic year. &nbsp;Burnout was defined as experiencing any symptom of emotional exhaustion or depersonalization at least weekly, reported on a modified Maslach Burnout Inventory. &nbsp;Bivariate comparisons were performed using Fisher exact tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 313 survey respondents (89.7% response rate), 94 were integrated residents, and 219 were fellows.&nbsp; Trainees were predominantly male (70.2%) and at academically-affiliated institutions (79.9%). &nbsp;Integrated residents appeared less likely to report satisfaction with the decision to become a surgeon (84.7 vs 91.5%, p = 0.095) and more likely to report thoughts of changing specialty (12.4 vs 8.4%, p = 0.370), although we were underpowered to detect statistical significance. &nbsp;Trainees in both paradigms were highly likely to report appropriate operative autonomy (84.8 vs 86.4%, p = 0.707), clinical autonomy (90.0 vs 89.4%, p = 1.0), and a sense of belonging in their program (83.8 vs 82.3%, p = 0.862). &nbsp;Reported rates of burnout (44.4 vs. 42.6%, p = 0.791) and thoughts of leaving the program (9.9 vs 11.8%, p = 0.836) were similar between training paradigms.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Vascular surgery trainees in both integrated and traditional training paradigms had positive perceptions of their clinical, operative, and interpersonal experience. &nbsp;Despite similar rates of burnout and thoughts of leaving the program, it is possible that integrated residents experience lower job satisfaction and increased thoughts of changing specialties. &nbsp;As the popularity of integrated residencies increases, it is important to ensure that medical students have ample experience in surgical specialties to inform a possible career choice in an integrated pathway.

Maassel<sup>1</sup>, R. A. Cowles<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Yale School Of Medicine,Division Of Pediatric Surgery,New Haven, CT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Pediatric esophageal anomalies, such as esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF), are rare and morbid conditions that require complex surgical care. We sought to characterize the esophageal operative training received by pediatric surgery fellows&nbsp;by quantifying the trend and distribution of esophageal surgery case volumes among trainees over the last 16 years.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) annual case log reports for pediatric surgery training programs were queried from 2004 to&nbsp;2019. Number of trainees and total case volumes for esophageal procedures were obtained for each year. Additionally, mean, standard deviation, median and minimum case numbers were obtained when available for specific esophageal procedures, including antireflux operations, EA/TEF repair, esophageal resection/replacement, and esophagomyotomy. The presence of monotonic trends in average case volume were determined using Mann-Kendall tests, with significance assigned for p&lt;0.05. Coefficients of variation (CoV) were calculated to measure relative variation of case volumes between trainees.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 2004 to 2019, the number of pediatric surgery trainees increased by 75% (24 vs 42), and the average esophageal case volume per trainee trended downward (59.1 vs&nbsp;39.5 cases; p&lt;0.01). There was a significant downward trend for the average number of antireflux operations performed by trainees during this time period (48.9 vs&nbsp;26.8 cases, p&lt;0.01), whereas the average number of non-antireflux operations performed trended upward (12.6 vs&nbsp;16.2 cases, p&lt;0.01). The CoV for average case volume in 2004 compared to 2019 was 43% vs 62% for EA/TEF repair, 83% vs 143% for esophageal resection/replacement, and 100% vs 143% for esophagomyotomy. The minimum number of esophageal replacement/resection and esophagomyotomy operations performed by an individual trainee was zero for each year between 2009 and 2019; the minimum number of EA/TEF repairs performed in these years ranged from 0 to 4.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Esophageal surgery case volumes for pediatric surgery fellows have decreased over the past 16 years. Although the&nbsp;average number of non-antireflux esophageal procedures performed by trainees has increased&nbsp;over this time period, there is substantial and rising variation in&nbsp;case volumes between trainees. As such,&nbsp;operative volumes of these complex cases for individual trainees remain relatively low. Each year, there are fellowship graduates who are not exposed to certain esophageal operations. The rarity and unequal distribution of operative experience in esophageal surgery suggests that some pediatric surgery fellows may not achieve competency in performing these complex procedures.

Hoffman<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Geisinger Medical Center,Department Of Surgery,Danville, PENNSYLVANIA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Goal orientation (GO) is a psychological construct describing a learner&rsquo;s intrinsic motivation for learning in three domains: mastery (M), learners strive to attain competence; performance approach (PAP), learners strive to demonstrate competence; and performance avoid (PAV), learners strive to avoid demonstrating incompetence. Research in disciplines outside of medicine has shown that a learner&rsquo;s predominant type of GO can have adaptive or maladaptive (PAV) implications for knowledge acquisition, well-being and job satisfaction. A previously validated scale of GO, the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scale (PALS), was developed to examine learning and motivation in children/young adults, and later adapted for surgical trainees (aPALS).&nbsp; However, this scale did not appropriately capture all three domains in surgeons.&nbsp; Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a novel GO scale for use in surgical residents and compare to the aPALS.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A novel GO scale, GGOS, was developed from the previously validated PALS score as well as informal focus groups. The novel GGOS scale consisted of 14 questions deliberately constructed to address the 3 domains, with responses recorded on a frequency scale (&ldquo;during the past month&rdquo;) ranging from &ldquo;never (0), rarely (1), weekly (2), &gt;weekly (3), and daily (4)&rdquo;. A questionnaire including both the aPALS and GGOS scales was administered in person to all 24 general surgery residents in an academic surgical training program at the same.&nbsp;The psychometric properties of the aPALS were compared to those of the GGOS utilizing an exploratory factor analysis

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Twenty-four (100%) residents completed the survey. The median resident age was 30 years (IQR 27, 34) and 10 (41.7%) respondents were female. The Cronbach alpha of the aPALS was &alpha;=0.79 while the novel GGOS was &alpha;=0.83. The results of an exploratory factor analysis using the aPALS revealed 6 domains, whereas the GGOS measured three factors as intended.&nbsp; Mastery had the best precision with 4/5 (80%) of the intended questions falling under the same factor during analysis. PAV and PAP were mixed together within the other two factors. Using the intended three domains, average scale scores for each domain were: PAV (1.2), PAP (1.8), and M (2.4).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The novel GGOS scale demonstrated better performance characteristics for measuring motivation in surgical residents than the aPALS. Further adaptation of the questions are needed to accurately compartmentalize PAV, PAP and M within the scale. Proper scale development is important, as this novel perspective on education and well-being may ultimately facilitate an improved and more efficient learning environment for trainees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Effective and efficient self-training is ever more essential as instruction time is limited by both resident work-hour restrictions and constraints of teaching faculty. Artificial intelligence (AI) may contribute to self-training by providing feedback that reflects behaviors of an expert. This study investigates a deep convolutional neural network to develop AI that can mimic eye-gaze behaviors of an expert performing a peg-transfer task that residents practice independently to achieve proficiency for the Fundamental of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program. A machine learning model that can imitate the expert-gaze corresponding to how the trainee is manipulating the instruments and transferring pegs could be invaluable to guide trainees in developing visual attentional control.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A two staged 3D convolutional neural network called Coarse Attention to Fine-Grained Gaze prediction was adapted to train a gaze prediction model for the FLS peg transfer task. To collect data for training the model, 13 medical students were recruited to practice the peg transfer task until they reached the FLS performance criteria. A total of 779 trials of video recording and eye-tracking data were collected. The best performing 177 trials were divided into 124 training, 17 validation and 36 test videos for training and testing the gaze prediction model. These best performing trials represented performance and gaze pattern of proficient individuals to build a model useful for guiding novices.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The final gaze prediction model was composed of 38 layers that extract spatial and temporal information from series of 16 video frames (i.e., .6s) as well as gaze location of every frame. For the test dataset, this model had an average angular error of 2.1 degrees (sd=0.275) and distance error of 88 pixels (sd=11) on a 1280x720 resolution monitor. The magnitude of the average error translates to a slight overlap between the fields of foveal vision (~2.5 degrees) for the predicted and actual gaze locations of the test dataset. Figure 1 presents an example of the predicted and actual eye gaze on one video frame.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This prediction model mimics the dynamic gaze behaviors of individuals proficient at the peg-transfer task with a sufficiently low error rate for guiding novices in directing their visual attention. This model is novel for the surgical domain in that the predicted gaze dynamically adjust to the trainee actions in real time (e.g., the exact peg being moved). Future research will focus on an end-to-end modelling of ego-centric gaze prediction specific to surgical tasks for improving accuracy and accommodating a wider range of visual scenes.

Cataldo<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,Surgery,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;The addition of a new surgical fellow on service debatably decreases resident case volume, and though it is common notion that residents are resistant to new fellowships, general surgery residents have not been directly surveyed regarding this issue.&nbsp;This study aimed to assess resident expectations regardinging&nbsp;the addition of a fellow to the colorectal surgery service at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and to reassess their attitudes toward the fellowship after completion of their rotation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An IRB approved survey&nbsp;was administered to residents before starting the Colorectal Surgery service and administered again after the completion of the rotation. The results were compared using Chi-Square analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 15 residents participated, with 9 completing each survey and 3 residents completing both surveys. 73% of participants&nbsp;previously rotated on&nbsp;service before the institution of a colorectal fellow,&nbsp;27% were junior residents, 77% were senior residents. 100% of residents who completed the pre-rotation survey expected to have fewer operative cases, while only 56% reported fewer cases&nbsp;post rotation&nbsp;(X<sup>2</sup>(4, n = 18) = 8.44, p=.076).&nbsp;56% of pre-rotation participants expected less autonomy in the OR, however only 22% reported experiencing this post rotation (X<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(4, n = 18) = 10.64, p&lt;.05).&nbsp;89% of pre-rotation participants expected the fellow to limit&nbsp;interaction with the attending,&nbsp;but only 11% reported experiencing this post rotation&nbsp;(X<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(1, n = 18) = 10.89 p&lt; .05). Only 44% surveyed pre-rotation&nbsp;expected the presence of a fellow to improve their experience&nbsp;but 78% reported improved experience&nbsp;post rotation&nbsp;(X<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(4, n = 18) = 6.78 p=0.148). There was no difference in expected or experienced&nbsp;improvement of on-service education with a fellow (56%)&nbsp;(X<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(4, n = 18) = 0, p=1.0)&nbsp;or improvement of outpatient experience (22%)&nbsp;(X<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(4, n = 18) = 2.99, p=.558).&nbsp;33% of pre-rotation residents expected the fellow to limit their inpatient decision making,&nbsp;22% reported this&nbsp;post rotation&nbsp;(X<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(4, n = 18) = 4.51, p=.341). Finally, 33% of pre-rotation residents expected to experience fewer duty hour violations, while 67% experienced fewer duty hour violations post rotation (X<sup>2</sup>(4, n = 18) = 4.58, p=.333).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This study demonstrates that resident expectations regarding the addition of a Colorectal Surgery Fellow differs from their actual experience and may be more positive than&nbsp;anticipated. This is especially true regarding attending interaction, operative autonomy and possibly even number of cases. Though limited by sample size and low&nbsp;participant retention, these findings oppose common dogma regarding the negative impact of a fellowship on the resident experience and provide a unique insight into the resident perspective.

Travel restrictions during the 2020-21 academic year will alter the surgical fellowship process for both the program and the applicant. With fewer site visits, applicants will need to find other resources to help compile rank lists. Institutional websites will play a larger role in this decision-making process. The objective of this study was to analyze Complex General Surgical Oncology (CGSO) fellowship websites for information relevant to resident applicants.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The publicly available Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) program directory was accessed for a list of accredited programs as of July 2020. Each program&rsquo;s institutional webpage was accessed via Google&reg; search and assessed for the presence or absence of 44 previously established content criteria.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The 29 CGSO fellowships accredited by the SSO were examined. Each program was also accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Within the SSO listing directory, each fellowship program has an individual webpage. The SSO webpage did not have a hyperlink to any of the institutions&rsquo; fellowship pages. A median of 15 total criteria were found on institutions&rsquo; websites (range, 6-33).&nbsp; Only 17% (N=5) of the programs fulfilled at least 50% of the content criteria. The most common criteria identified was description of the fellowship program and program coordinator&nbsp;contact information, found on 100% (N=29) and 97% (N=28) of the websites, respectively. Only 12 criteria were found on at least 50% of program websites.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Online CGSO fellowship information is lacking. With fewer opportunities to showcase programs and recruit applicants during this academic year, programs should increase the content value of their websites.

We sought to characterize similarities and differences the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the emotional, professional, personal and financial well-being of surgical faculty and trainees.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A web-based survey evaluating physician stressors and concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic was distributed via social media. Study inclusion required respondents to be practicing surgeons or trainees preparing for careers in surgery (including fellows, residents, and medical students).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Respondents included 117 individuals, among whom 68 (59%) were faculty and 49 (41%) were trainees. Both faculty and trainees experienced feeling negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of physical (73.5% vs 53.1%; p=0.022), mental (85.3% vs 65.3%; p=0.011), and occupational wellness (79.1% vs 52.1%; p=0.002). Faculty and trainees also reported increased financial stress associated with decreased income (58.6% vs 36.1%; p=0.034) and loss of work (61.8% vs 38.5%; p=0.049). Concerns about working from home (81.6% vs 81.8%; p=0.977) and potential adverse patient outcomes due to care delay (85.4% vs 76.1%; p=0.247) represented the top professional stressors for both faculty and trainees. Worry about family and friends (85.4% vs 87.7%; p=0.725) was the greatest personal stressor for both groups. The majority of respondents (91.2% faculty and 87.8% trainees) modified their home living situations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A significantly higher proportion of faculty respondents had reviewed or made their wills (45.6% vs 14.3%; p&lt;0.001), whereas almost half of all trainees have made no advanced care or financial planning (49.0% vs 27.9%; p=0.020).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the wellness of both surgical faculty and trainees, with many similarities in both personal and professional impact. In order to optimize surgical training, it is essential that we identify emerging stressors and implement programs to support faculty and trainees through the challenges experienced.

The Kampala Advanced Trauma Course (KATC) is a context-specific training program developed in Uganda by local and international experts. In 2018, cohorts of healthcare workers participated in&nbsp;5-day training courses that combined&nbsp;didactic learning, practical hands-on skill stations, and simulations. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the KATC program on trauma care and determine the barriers participants faced in applying skills acquired during training.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 attending physicians, physicians in training, and nurses who participated in KATC trauma courses over the previous year. We asked respondents to reflect on trauma management in their local settings,&nbsp;perceptions of barriers to care, feelings toward KATC training, and experiences incorporating KATC skills into daily practice. We transcribed and coded these interviews using an inductive grounded theory approach, then categorized emergent themes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Half (14) of participants were from national or regional referral hospitals. Most (23) worked at public hospitals. Participants explained that KATC exposed knowledge gaps, improved proficiency and confidence in management, and described successful outcomes in specific patients. Specific barriers to skill use included physical resource (i.e&nbsp;equipment)&nbsp; constraints; and limited opportunities to practice or share skills with peers. These factors combined with the large volume of information delivered in the course also led to concerns about long-term knowledge retention. Participants described themselves as &ldquo;islands of knowledge&rdquo; in their institutions. Only one to three providers from each institution had the opportunity to receive KATC training, and this placed increased pressure on them to translate training into practice and lead team-based resuscitations. Themes were integrated into a model of KATC skill translation and transference&nbsp;(figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Qualitative analysis of a contextually-appropriate trauma course in Uganda showed that participants reported substantial benefit in fund of knowledge and skill acquisition. However, multiple barriers to translating skills to practice included lack of equipment, practice, reinforcement of knowledge, and being an &ldquo;island of knowledge&rdquo; within their facilities. Our plans to address these factors include team-based training at the level of rural facilities, improved educational resources after course delivery, and addressing physical resource gaps. This study illustrates the critical role of qualitative analysis in assessing impact of a trauma capacity-building initiative, and may be useful for other global surgery training initiatives.

L. Chang<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Francisco,School Of Medicine,San Francisco, CA, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of California - San Francisco,Department Of Otolaryngology- Head And Neck Surgery,San Francisco, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States has had significant implications on medical student surgical education. A cornerstone of surgical education traditionally involves hands-on procedural and surgical learning. However, in this era, hands-on learning may confer viral exposure and transmission risk. As healthcare systems proceed with recovery from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to understand medical student perceptions regarding their participation in clinical settings and their comfort in communicating concerns related to their participation. We thus conducted a survey of medical students at our institution to understand these issues.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
University of California, San Francisco medical students of all years of training were invited to complete an anonymous survey between April 26 and May 10, 2020.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 241 medical students (37% of the student body) completed the survey; the vast majority (95%) of students were concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their education. Of participants, 116 (50%) reported an interest in a surgical or procedure-oriented specialty and 54 (23%) were unsure of their medical specialty interests.

Students reported varying levels of comfort interfacing with patients based on COVID-19 status. Of students on clinical rotations, 31% reported they would not feel comfortable participating in clinical encounters for COVID-19-positive patients. In comparison, 6% did not feel comfortable in COVID-19-negative encounters and 12% noted discomfort with asymptomatic patients with unknown COVID-19 status. Students reported they would be comfortable in interfacing with COVID-19 positive patients if supervised throughout the encounter (53%) or if the encounter did not involve an aerosol-generating procedure (56%).

Students reported they are most comfortable voicing COVID-19 related concerns to their clinical rotation teams through anonymous surveys created by their peers (83% of respondents) and anonymous surveys created by clerkship directors (76%). Fewer students felt comfortable communicating their concerns through group or one-on-one discussions with clerkship directors (52% and 48%, respectively).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges to medical student surgical and procedural education paradigms. However, the majority of students desire to be involved in patient care regardless of COVID-19 status, though some may hold reservations in interacting with COVID-19-positive patients during aerosol-generating procedures or unsupervised procedures. Students feel most comfortable communicating their concerns through anonymous surveys, which should be considered by clinicians integrating medical students into their teams.

Ricci<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Albert Einstein College Of Medicine,Bronx, NY, USA <sup>2</sup>Montefiore Medical Center,Department Of Surgery, Division Of Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery,Bronx, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Ultrasound is a versatile tool that allows point-of-care diagnosis and image-guided procedures in many surgical settings. It is gaining popularity in medical training, however the adaptation of formal ultrasound curriculums among surgical subspecialties has not been universal. This study aims to assess the current state of ultrasound curriculum in surgical resident education by performing an analytical review of the recent literature. We treat the published literature as a surrogate for quantifying the degree of ultrasound training in effect across surgical subspecialties. The sparsity of literature in plastic and reconstructive surgery (PRS), despite the increasing number of published ultrasound applications in this field, suggests the need for further investigation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A PubMed search using &ldquo;surgery OR surgical&rdquo; and &ldquo;ultrasound OR ultrasonography OR sonogram&rdquo; in titles and abstracts and &ldquo;internship and residency&rdquo; in MeSH terms was used to identify the literature from the recent 10 year 2010-2019 on ultrasound curriculum in surgical resident education. Articles without a reference to a specific ultrasound procedure, training modality, or a surgical-related speciality were excluded. Titles and abstracts were reviewed. The data was compared with the total number of on-duty residents in ACGME programs in 2019.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total 227 articles were identified and, after exclusion, 117 articles were reviewed. Emphasis was placed on subspecialties with integrated programs, namely PRS, cardiothoracic, and vascular surgery. Anesthesia and emergency medicine constituted 36% and 22% of articles. General surgery made up 30%, and surgical subspecialities had minor contributions (TABLE1). A one-tailed z-test was applied to test if the percent of literature contribution under-represents or over-represents the proportion of on-duty residents in 2019 in a given specialty. While anesthesia made a significantly higher contribution (p&lt;0.00001) in the literature and general surgery had a fair representation, PRS is significantly under-represented in the literature (p=0.029). During the same period of time, integrated PRS programs continue to increase in number and total number of residents nationwide.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;An analytical review of the recent literature on ultrasound curriculum in surgical resident education was performed. When compared with the number of on-duty residents, the results demonstrated an under-representation in surgical subspecialty fields such as PRS. Given the growing interest among trainees to enter integrated subspecialty programs, there is a need for specialty-specific literature to critically evaluate and promote ultrasound training in subspecialty residency programs.

Depression is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that has been associated with adverse outcomes in chronic disease. The relationship between depression and postoperative outcomes has previously been described, but data in colorectal surgery remains limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of history of depression among patients undergoing colectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Adult patients from the IBM MarketScan Research Databases (2010-2017) who underwent colon resection were included within the study and were stratified by whether or not they had a history of depression, defined by 1) a diagnosis of depression during the index admission, 2) a diagnosis of depression during any inpatient admission in the year prior, 3) a diagnosis of depression during any outpatient encounter in the year prior, and/or 4) a pharmacy claim for an antidepressant in the year prior. The primary outcomes were length of stay (LOS) and total inpatient hospital costs. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality as well as postoperative complications. Statistical analyses performed included logistic, negative binomial, and quantile regressions.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among 88,981 included patients, 24,244 (24.1%) had a history of depression. The mean postoperative LOS for those with and without history of depression was 6.51 and 6.98 days (p&lt;0.001), respectively. The median total inpatient hospital cost&nbsp;was $29,041 and $29,135 (p=0.234), respectively. Compared to those without the diagnosis, patients with a history of depression were expected to have a significantly longer LOS (IRR=1.06, 95% CI [1.05, 1.08], p&lt;0.001) and increased odds of in-hospital mortality (OR=1.37, 95% CI [1.08, 1.73], p=0.009), but no difference in cost&nbsp;(p=0.257), after adjusting for baseline demographic, clinical, and operational factors (Table). History of depression was also independently associated with increased odds of respiratory complication (OR=1.20), pneumonia (OR=1.18), and delirium (OR=1.99; all p&lt;0.05).
&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

History of depression was present in almost one-fourth of a cohort of individuals undergoing colectomy, and was associated with greater postoperative mortality, longer LOS, and higher odds of postoperative complication. Findings from this large claims database raise further research questions on the effect of preoperative identification and treatment of depression on reducing morbidity in colorectal surgery.

Interventional treatments for early to moderate grade hemorrhoids range from outpatient-based procedures to surgical intervention. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes and effectiveness for treatments of early to moderate grade hemorrhoids grade 1 to 3.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) were identified by means of a PRISMA compliant systematic review using Medline, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trial of a procedural intervention for hemorrhoids. Studies were excluded if the study population had grade four hemorrhoids. A Frequentist Network Meta-analysis was performed using netmeta and shiny package in R.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Sixty-Three RCTs were identified including 7956 patients and 20 different treatments. There were few instances of inconsistency between direct and indirect comparisons. Recurrence of hemorrhoidal symptoms was reported by 37 RCTs, involving 6254 patients and 17 treatments. Suture mucopexy was ranked with the lowest recurrence, followed by open/closed hemorrhoidectomy, doppler guided hemorrhoid artery ligation (DG-HAL) with mucopexy, stapled hemorrhoidopexy, rubber band ligation, infrared coagulation and injection sclerotherapy. Post-operative bleeding was recorded in 37 trials involving 4442 patients. Open hemorrhoidectomy revealed the highest occurrence of post-operative bleeding, followed by radiofrequency coagulation, stapled hemorrhoidopexy and closed hemorrhoidectomy. Direct-current (DC) electrotherapy and bipolar coagulation had the lowest rates of bleeding. Pain on post-operative day 1 measured by&nbsp;a Visual Analog Scale was reported in 32 studies involving 2616 patients and 17 treatments. DC electrotherapy, DG-HAL with mucopexy and infra-red coagulation yielded the lowest pain scores, while closed hemorrhoidectomy, harmonic scalpel hemorrhoidectomy and diathermy hemorrhoidectomy were ranked with the highest pain scores. Patients who had undergone re-treatment, additional treatment or crossover was reported in 24 studies with 3310 patients involving 16 treatments. Diathermy hemorrhoidectomy, open hemorrhoidectomy, and Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy had the lowest numbers of reported additional or re-treatment, while bipolar coagulation, DC electrotherapy, injection sclerotherapy and infrared coagulation had the highest numbers of reported additional or re-treatment.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Open and closed hemorrhoidectomies are associated with the highest pain scores with comparatively low recurrence. Suture mucopexy and DG-HAL with mucopexy are associated with both lower recurrence and reduced pain compared to other treatment modalities. The advantages and disadvantages of each treatment should be discussed with the patient before a surgical decision should be made.

Previous research suggested that the hospital by-pass (HB) effect has a net positive effect on patient overall survival for certain malignancies. There is a lack of data regarding the effect of HB on colon cancer (CC). Our aim was to examine the effect of HB on treatment utilization and survival in patients with CC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients with localized and regional colon cancer (CC) were identified in the Texas Cancer Registry-Database (1995-2016). Clinicopathological data, hospital factors, and receipt of optimal treatment (guideline-concordant) and overall survival (OS) were compared between hospital bypass (HB, bypassing closest hospital) and non-hospital bypass (NHB, going to closest hospital) cohorts determined by geospatial analysis (latitude/longitude data). Multivariable analysis (MVA) was performed to determine factors associated with increased probability of hospital bypass and mortality at 5 years

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified 43,557 patients with localized (L) and regional (R) CC. HB patients were more likely to be younger than 50 (L: 7.7% vs 6.1%, p&lt;0.001, R: 12.2% vs. 8.7%, p&lt;0.001), have private insurance (L: 22.9% vs 18.8, p&lt;0.001, R: 23.6% vs. 18.9%, p&lt;0.001), belong to low poverty index (0-5%) areas (L: 17.2% vs. 12.1%, p&lt;0.001, R: 16.9% vs. 12.0%, p&lt;0.001) and be treated at American College of Surgeons Commision on Cancer (ACS-CoC) accredited hospitals (L: 60.4% vs 30.8%, p&lt;0.001, R: 61.5% vs. 31.4%, p&lt;0.001) when compared to the NHB group. HB patients had better 5-year overall survival (L: 71.2% vs. 68.4%, p=0.021, R: 56.2% vs. 52.2%, p=0.005) and higher optimal treatment rates for regional colon cancer (67.0% vs. 64.7%, p=0.008). On MVA, factors associated with improved 5-year overall survival include HB status, age &lt;50, private insurance, low poverty index, and treatment at ACS-CoC accredited hospitals (all p&lt;0.01)


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Colon cancer patients that bypass their local hospital are more likely to be younger, on private insurance and to be treated in ACS-CoC accredited hospitals. All these factors are associated with improved survival. Moreover, HB status alone is associated with significantly increased 5-year survival and increased receipt of optimal treatment for regional colon cancer patients. NHB may be a marker of an at-risk-population with limited access to specialized multidisciplinary cancer care.

Stefanou<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Henry Ford Health System,Division Of Colon And Rectal Surgery,Detroid, MI, USA <sup>2</sup>Henry Ford Health System,Department Of Public Health Sciences,Detroid, MI, USA <sup>3</sup>Henry Ford Health System,Department Of Surgery,Detroid, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

The role of bowel preparation before colorectal surgery has evolved over time. Historically, preoperative bowel preparation&nbsp;was believed to reduce intestinal stool and bacterial burden, potentially reducing the rate of surgical site infection (SSI), anastomotic dehiscence, and perioperative morbidity and mortality. The choice of preoperative bowel preparation includes mechanical bowel preparation alone (MBP), oral antibiotic bowel preparation (OAP), or a combination of the two (MAP). Preoperative bowel preparation is also believed to&nbsp;protect the newly fashioned intestinal anastomosis. This presents a unique consideration in patients for which no anastomosis is planned. Currently the majority of the literature supporting MAP includes all colectomies or is limited to those patients who have anastomosis&nbsp;and excludes&nbsp;patients who underwent colorectal resection with primary colostomy (Hartmann procedure). While sometimes included in overall studies, this unique patient cohort&nbsp;has not been exclusively examined. These patients do not have anastomosis and therefore may not benefit as much from preoperative MBP or OAP.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) colectomy-targeted database, we aimed to evaluate the impact of different preoperative bowel preparations on short-term outcomes in patients who had elective colorectal resection with creation of end colostomy (Hartmann procedure). Primary outcomes evaluated included postoperative outcomes, particularly infectious complications such as SSI, wound disruption, Clostridium difficile colitis, and need for reoperation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of the 5708 patients analyzed, 3088 (54.1%) received no preparation, 325 (5.7%) received oral antibiotic preparation alone, 1174 (20.6%) received mechanical bowel preparation alone, and 1121 (19.6%) received both mechanical and oral antibiotics (or dual) preparations. After propensity adjustment, the use of mechanical bowel preparation alone increased the risk of deep incisional SSI compared to no bowel preparation (odds ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.07-3.18). In contrast, OAP&nbsp;and MAP&nbsp;decreased the risk of any SSI (odds ratio 0.42, 95% CI 0.28-0.65; and odds ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.54-0.85, respectively), and superficial SSI (odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.18-0.69; and odds ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.33-0.64, respectively). OAP and MAP were also associated with significantly shorter length of stay. On multivariate analysis, OAP and MAP were predictive of fewer infectious complications and shorter length of stay, but not reoperation or readmission.&nbsp;&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The use of combined oral antibiotic and mechanical&nbsp;bowel preparation significantly reduces the rate of infectious complications compared to no bowel preparation in patients undergoing elective Hartmann procedure.

Rentea<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Children's Mercy Hospital- University Of Missouri Kansas City,Kansas City, MO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Botulinum toxin (BT) injections assist in temporarily relieving obstructive symptoms due to internal anal sphincter (IAS) achalasia in patients with Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease following surgical pull-through. The use of BT may play a role in preventing Hirschsprung associated enterocolitis (HAEC) episodes related to IAS dysfunction. Our aim was to determine the effect of scheduled outpatient Botulinum injections on the development of HAEC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of children diagnosed with Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease between January 2010 &ndash; July 2020 was performed. The timing from pull-through to first HAEC episode and to first BT injection was recorded. Episodes of recurrent HAEC and timing to a recurrent HAEC episode was analyzed between patients who received outpatient BT injections and those who did not. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Eighty patients were included. Sixty patients (75%) were male, 15 (19%) were diagnosed with trisomy 21 and 18 (22.5%) had congenital heart disease. The median time to pull-through was 150 days (IQR 16, 132). Fifty-eight patients (72.5%) had short-segment disease, 7 (9%) had long-segment disease, and 6 (7.5%) had total colonic or small bowel disease. Seven patients (9%) had neither an episode of HAEC or BT injections and were not included in further analysis. Fifty-five patients (69%) experienced at least one episode of HAEC within 38 days (IQR 15, 283) following pull-through, with patients experiencing a median of 2 episodes (IQR 1,4). 54 (68%) had at least one outpatient BT injection. The median time to first BT injection following pull-through was 329 days (IQR 54, 807) with patients undergoing a median of two injections (IQR 1, 3). Twenty patients had scheduled outpatient Botox injections with obstructive symptoms prior to documented HAEC episode (median time from pull-through = 71 days), and only two subsequently developed HAEC (95 and 247 days from pull-through). In patients who experienced HAEC prior to their first outpatient injection (n=31), only 12 (39%) experienced another episode of HAEC requiring inpatient treatment. The median time to the next HAEC episode was 129 days (IQR 34, 406) following outpatient BT injection. In comparison, 28 patients had a recurrent episode of HAEC without BT injections performed. The median time to the recurrent HAEC episode was 36.5 days (IQR 13, 164), which was significantly shorter (p = 0.04).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The use of outpatient BT helps to prevent episodes of HAEC and also increases the interval between HAEC episodes. The use of scheduled outpatient BT injections to manage obstructive symptoms may be a beneficial Hirschsprung disease patients following pull-through.

These procedures can be technically challenging, and complications rates can be as high as 45% depending on the type of ostomy. The impact of surgical subspecialty on outcomes in these patients has not been well studied. The aim of the current study was to compare short term outcomes of ileostomy and colostomy reversal by colorectal surgeons and non-colorectal surgeons (CRS and Non-CRS) utilizing our institution specific National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This retrospective study analyzed our tertiary care center specific NSQIP database for ileostomy and colostomy takedowns (CPT codes 44227, 44626, 44620,44625) between 2009 and 2020. Surgeon specialty was identified by chart review. Primary outcome of interest was overall complication rates for CRS and Non-CRS. Secondary endpoints were procedure duration, and length of stay (LOS).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 321 ostomy takedown procedures were performed: 22% end colostomy, 8% loop colostomy, 13% end ileostomy, and 58% loop ileostomy. Of these, 83% were performed by CRS. Mean age of the cohort was 52yrs (SD: &plusmn;15) and 46% were females. Mean BMI was 27(SD: &plusmn;6). There were more secondary procedures performed in the non-CRS (41%) as compared to the CRS groups (24%). There were no differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between patients operated on by CRS and Non-CRS. Overall complication rates were 20% and 16% for the CRS and Non-CRS groups respectively (Table 1). Infectious complications were the most common category of complications in both groups. After adjusting for available confounders, having an end ostomy reversed and a higher ASA class were associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications, however, surgeon specialty was not. Procedure duration was shorter for CRS but there was no difference in LOS between the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this single institutional series, ileostomy and colostomy reversals were associated with significant postoperative morbidity. However, patients managed by CRS and Non-CRS surgeons had similar perioperative outcomes.

Rectal cancer (RC) continues to be a significant burden in the United States despite all the advances made in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Multiple studies have shown that racial disparities do exist in the incidence of rectal cancer. However, disparities in the surgical management of the disease are less investigated. Abdominoperineal resection is a less desirable surgical option for most patients due to the fact that the patient has a permanent stoma that might impact their quality of life. The aim of our study was to elucidate if there are racial disparities in the surgical treatment options for rectal cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a 3-year (2016-2018) analysis of the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. We included all adult patients who underwent a low anterior resection (LAR) or abdominoperineal resection (APR) for the management of rectal cancer. Patients demographics were noted. Patients were stratified into two groups based on surgical intervention (APR vs. LAR). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 10,365 patients were analyzed and included in the analysis. The mean age was 49.65 years, 61.3% were males, 67.0% of the patients underwent a LAR compare to 33% that got an APR, and 60.9% had an American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) classification &ge; to 3. Race distribution included 79.4% White, 7.8% African American, and 5.3% Hispanic. Patients in the African American, American Indian (Alaskan Native), Asian, and Hispanic groups were more likely to undergo LAR compare to APR. On multivariate logistic regression, Native Hawaiians (or Pacific Islanders) had higher odds of undergoing APR compared to LAR for rectal cancer management.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Native Hawaiians (or Pacific Islanders) are more likely to have an APR than LAR. &nbsp;African Americans, who normally have a higher incidence of rectal cancer, are do not have a higher chance of having an APR. Race appears to play a lesser role in the surgical management of rectal cancer.

There is a debate regarding the prognosis of the various histological types of colorectal cancer including adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell colorectal cancers. Our aim is to determine if there are any differences in overall and disease-free survival between these three histological types in stages II and III colorectal adenocarcinoma.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Data was retrospectively collected for all patients diagnosed with colon cancer who underwent resection at a single institution between 1/1/2004 through 12/31/2015.

Patients with stage II and III colorectal adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinomas and signet-ring cell carcinomas were included in our analysis. Dichotomous variables were assessed using the &chi;2 test or Fisher&rsquo;s exact test. Kaplan-Meire curves and log-rank tests were used for assessing the differences in survival between the groups. A Multivariable regression model was fit adjusting for histopathological diagnosis, age, stage, site, grade, ASA score, adjuvant chemotherapy and extramural vascular invasion.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 1,173 patients were included in this analysis. Of those, 1090 patients had non-mucinous adenocarcinoma (93%) and 71 had mucinous adenocarcinomas (6%) and 12 had signet-ring cell carcinoma (1%). There was no association between histological type and gender, stage or anatomic site of tumor (p&gt;0.05). However, signet-ring cell carcinomas were more likely to have extramural vascular invasion and high-grade dysplasia (p&lt;0.001). There was a significant difference in overall and disease-free survival observed between patients with signet-ring cell carcinomas in comparison with mucinous adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma (p=0.008 and 0.001, respectively). When fitting a Cox regression model, signet-ring cell carcinoma (HR: 2.6; CI: 1.0-6.5; p=0.04) was an independent prognostic factor of poor overall survival, but mucinous adenocarcinoma was not (HR: 1.1; CI: 0.7-1.7; p=0.6).

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Patients with stage II and III colorectal signet-ring cell carcinoma had a significantly poorer prognosis compared to patients with mucinous and nonmucinous adenocarcinoma. Histologic type should be kept in mind when determining the treatment course of these patients.

Patients undergoing this procedure are at risk of increased morbidity and readmissions because of their new ostomy status and/or the underlying disease. The current study evaluated risk factors associated with hospital readmissions and the impact of perioperative morbidity among patients undergoing a diverting ileostomy or colostomy without resection.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Adult patients undergoing laparoscopic or open fecal diversion without resection [colostomy (CPT: 44188 and 44320) or ileostomy (CPT: 44187 and 44310)] where identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant User File (2016-2018). Primary end points were readmission within 30 days and pre- and post-discharge grade 3 complications.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among the total cohort of 7864 patients, 26% had an ileostomy, while 74% underwent a colostomy. Of these, 54% were performed laparoscopically. The median age was 61 years (IQR:51-71), and BMI was 25 &nbsp;(IQR:22-30), with 51% of patients being females. The median length of stay was 5 days (IQR:3-9) and the readmissions rates were 20% and 14% for ileostomy and colostomy, respectively. &nbsp;In multivariable analysis of the whole cohort, younger age, female gender, pre- or post-discharge grade 3 complications, and ileostomy were all independently associated with an increased risk of readmission (Table 1). Conversely, indications (colorectal cancer, diverticular disease, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease), surgical approach, and emergent surgery were not found to be significantly associated with higher readmission rates. Post-discharge grade 3 complications had the largest magnitude of effect for readmissions (OR:13.9, CI:11.14-17.22). Weight loss &gt; 10%, ASA &gt;2, and emergency surgery were independently associated with higher rates of post-discharge grade 3 complications. The risk of these complications was decreased by using laparoscopy.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this large national cohort of patients, we identified high rates of readmissions among patients undergoing primary fecal diversion without resection. Ileostomy was independently associated with higher readmission rates. Post-discharge grade 3 complication was the strongest risk factor for readmissions, which in turn was associated with emergency surgery and patient comorbidities. These patients represent a high-risk group and should be considered for mitigating strategies.

Nfonsam<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Arizona,General Surgery,Tucson, AZ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) increases with age; however, despite younger patients making up only a small minority of CRC cases, studies have demonstrated that young patients are more likely to present with a more aggressive and advanced cancer. While staging at diagnosis and management of CRC are critical to mortality rates, the debate regarding whether young or older patients with metastatic CRC have better surgical outcomes after liver resection is still being deactively contested. The aim of this study was to examine the difference in short term surgical outcomes for early vs late-onset metastatic CRC patients undergoing liver resection.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A 3-year (2016-2018) analysis of the American College of Surgeons - National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) was performed. We included stage IV CRC patients with liver metastases who underwent liver resection. Patients were stratified into two groups, early-onset (&lt;45 years) and late-onset (&gt;45 years). Our outcomes measured were unplanned reoperations, hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day complications,&nbsp; 30-day mortality, and 30-day readmissions. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 903 patients were analyzed of which 12.4% (n=112) had early-onset CRC and 87.6% (n=791) had late-onset CRC and underwent liver resection. Mean age was 58 years, 42.7% were males, 68.1% were whites, mean hospital LOS was 7days and 80.4% had ASA class &gt;=3. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of unplanned reoperation (Early 4.5% vs Late: 4.4%, p=0.98), mortality (0.9% vs 0.9%, p=0.99), unplanned readmission (17% vs. 10.5%, p=0.12),&nbsp; median hospital LOS (6 [5-8] vs. 6 [4-8], p&gt;0.05), and 30-day complications (including; Surgical site infection, PE, DVT, Pneumonia, bleeding requiring transfusion, MI, and other complications). On regression analysis controlling for multiple confounding variables, no independent association was found between age and study outcomes including unplanned reoperation, 30days complications, mortality, and readmission,

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our study demonstrated that age alone is not independently associated with adverse short term surgical outcomes in stage IV CRC patients undergoing liver resection. The physiologic reserve of younger patients likely compensates for the outcome even though they might have more aggressive disease.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between surgical approach (laparoscopic versus open) and OSI in patients undergoing colon and rectal resections using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The NSQIP database was queried for patients undergoing colectomies between 2011 and 2017 using Current Procedural Terminology codes. Patients were then divided into two groups based on approach: laparoscopic and open. Comparisons between the two groups were completed using standardized mean difference (SMD). Univariate and multivariate propensity score-weighted logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between surgical approach and the occurrence of OSI.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 90,417 cases were included in the analysis: 72,519 (80.2%) laparoscopic and 17,898 (19.8%) open. A total of 2,483 cases (2.7%) of OSI were reported. The laparoscopic approach was associated with lower OSI compared to the open approach (3.4% vs 7.0%; p&lt;0.01). The laparoscopic group tended to be younger (60.8 &plusmn; 15.3 vs 62.4 &plusmn; 15.5 years; SMD=0.11) with a lower proportion of patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class &ge;3 (49.3% vs 61.8%; SMD=0.25). Males represented 48.2% of the patients with no difference in sex between the two group. Operative time was longer in the open group (190.4 &plusmn; 105.1 vs 176.6 &plusmn; 84.3 minutes; SMD=0.15). After propensity score matching, the balance of a set of demographics, preoperative risk factors, and wound class revealed a successful match with all covariates having an SMD&lt;0.10 except operative time (SMD=0.23). Multivariable analysis revealed the laparoscopic approach to have a lower association with OSI compared to the open approach (AOR 0.68; 95% CI 0.64-0.71; p&lt;0.01). Moreover, oral antibiotic prep (AOR 0.69; 95% CI 0.64-0.73; p&lt;0.01) and mechanical bowel prep (0.83; 95% CI 0.78-0.88; p&lt;0.01) were associated with lower risk of OSI. On the other hand, several other variables such as higher wound class, preoperative albumin &lt;3.5, prolonged operative time, ASA class &ge;3, smoking, steroid use, dialysis were associated with increased risk of OSI. Compared to malignant indication for the colectomy, benign indication was not associated with increased risk of OSI. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Compared to the open approach, laparoscopic colon resections are associated with a lower risk of OSI. This emphasizes the role of the laparoscopic approach when technically feasible in order to prevent this morbid postoperative complication.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This is a retrospective study of all trauma patients with a Chest Abbreviated Injury Scale (CAIS) &ge;&nbsp;2 admitted to Trauma Surgery at our Level I Trauma center from July 2008 to June 2015. Patients with absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) collected within 24h of admission were included. Exclusion criteria were death within 24 h, bowel perforation on admission, penetrating trauma, and burns. Demographics, injury characteristics, comorbidities, complications, and outcomes were collected. Lymphopenia was defined as ALC &le;&nbsp;1000. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of outcomes in BCWT patients with p&lt;0.05 considered significant.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 3849 trauma patients with CAIS &sup3;2, 1394 patients were included. Our cohort was 69.7% male, with a mean age of 51.4 years (18-100); 44.3% were lymphopenic. On univariate analysis, significant differences were noted on mortality, LOS, and discharge location (p &lt; 0.001 for all); no difference was noted in infection between lymphopenic and non-lymphopenic patients (p = 0.185). In logistic regression, controlling for CAIS, age, and comorbidities, lymphopenia was associated with prolonged LOS (OR=1.187 [1.059&ndash;1.33] p = 0.003) and with discharge to home with healthcare (OR=1.886 [1.135&ndash;3.133], p = 0.014) or to another facility (SNF/rehabilitation facility/ACH) (OR=1.605 [1.242&ndash;2.074], p &lt; 0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Lymphopenia on admission is associated with longer LOS and discharge requiring increased healthcare support, suggesting longer recovery for lymphopenic BCWT patients.

Increased rates of&nbsp;DVT&nbsp;is correlated with high rates of pulmonary embolism (PE) which is recognized to be a leading cause of death in trauma patients who survive beyond 24 hours. Routine screening for DVT in asymptomatic trauma patients is practice aimed at identifying thromboembolic events and initiating early treatment. We evaluated our trauma&nbsp;DVT&nbsp;screening protocol involving routine Duplex ultrasound at one week for patients still hospitalized at post trauma day 7 and weekly thereafter.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All adult patients admitted to a Level I trauma center who had a least one positive Duplex Ultrasound DVT screen over a 70-month period (Jan 2013 to October 2018) were identified from the trauma registry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients who received DVT screens earlier than one week or those that had superficial DVTs (eg peroneal or soleal clots) were excluded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients who developed PEs from this group were identified.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Among self-inflicted trauma patients, abdominal injury was most common injury, and neck/face injury, chest injury, and abdominal injury were related with aging. On the other hand, the rate of extremity injury decreased as patients&rsquo; age progressed.&nbsp;

Koch<sup>2</sup>, P. Dangle<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Urology,Birmingham, Alabama, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,School Of Medicine,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Pediatric female genital trauma(PFGT) is rare but potentially devastating and requires intervention to avoid long-term sequelae. Traditionally, evaluation and treatment under general anesthesia(GA) in the operating room(OR) is recommended. Alternatively, examination and repair under sedation in the emergency department(ED) may yield equivocal outcomes. Onen&rsquo;s genitourinary injury score(GIS) objectively describes PFGT severity but may not correlate with the level of care warranted. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of PFGTs managed in the ED vs. OR, propose a modified Onen&rsquo;s GIS scale, and introduce a treatment algorithm.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All patients treated at our institution from May 2009 to the present with associated ICD codes for PFGT were evaluated. Demographic, treatment and follow-up information was extracted from the electronic record. A cost analysis was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 37 patients was identified; the median age of 6.4 years, 19(51%) presented within 6 hours of injury, and straddle injury(27,72%) was the most common mechanism. Injuries were predominately Onen&rsquo;s GIS I-III(33,89%) with possible urethral involvement in 6(16%) patients. Sedation and repair in the ED were performed for 13(35%) patients vs. 24(65%) in the OR. The two cohorts did not significantly differ in Onen GIS severity (p&gt;0.05), and no major complications were observed. The majority of the OR cohort 18(75%) did not initially undergo sedation and attempted repair in the ED. Concern for vaginal mucosa or urethral involvement was the most common reason to forgo sedation, but ultimately none of these patients were found to have a urethral injury, and 11(61%) could have been safely managed in ED under sedation using Onen GIS = Grade 3 without urethral involvement as a cutoff. A female-specific modification to Onen&rsquo;s GIS Grade III to differentiate isolated distal vaginal mucosa(III-a) and deep vaginal mucosa and/or urethral involvement(III-b) is proposed, and a treatment algorithm was generated. The cost of services increased more than five-fold when taken to the OR. Repair in the OR was also associated with a greater than 35% increase in the cost of supplies and ancillary services. These differences did not account for the additional costs of anesthesiology and postoperative hospitalization.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Detailed evaluation and potential surgical repair under sedation in the ED as an initial step for all patients may conserve resources without compromising outcomes. Low-to-moderate severity PFGTs may be safely managed without GA in the OR with a significant cost-benefit.

Equestrian related injuries account for 45% of sports related traumatic brain injuries in the United States. Equestrian related trauma causes more injuries than motorcycle or auto racing. Stratification of the injuries sustained in horseback riding accidents has only been described in papers detailing EMR review of single Level I trauma centers or a few regional hospitals. The aim of this study was to stratify the different types and severity of equestrian injuries on a national level.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A 10-year review (2007-2016) of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) was conducted to identify injuries due to horseback riding. Injuries were separated into head and neck injuries (HNI), extremity injuries (EXTI), thoracic injuries (THORI) and abdominal injuries (ABDI).&nbsp;Variables or factors examined included:&nbsp; ethnicity, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, ED disposition and ventilator days. Logistic regression, chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze the data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Nationally, 24,791 adults were injured in equestrian related trauma. In descending order, THORI accounted for 9,189 (37.07%) injuries, 6,560 (26.47%) suffered EXTI, 5,689 (22.95%) sustained HNI, and 3,353 (13.52%) experienced ABDI. HNI caused 237 (74.83%) deaths while 59 (18.03%) were caused by THORI. Riders were more likely to die from HNI compared to EXTI (OR, 55.93; 24.08-129.89 95% CI; p&lt;0.001), or from THORI (OR, 7.18; 3.00-17.18 95% CI; p&lt;0.001). HNI had the highest ICU LOS (mean,4.66;SD,6.18).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Annually, over 2,000 equestrian related injuries resulted in presentation to a trauma center in the United States.&nbsp; While THORI were most commonly identified, HNI resulted in the highest mortality and ICU LOS. These results support the focus on prevention of HNI in equestrian sports.

The purpose of this study was (1) to compare estimated overall and age stratified incidence rates of proximal and distal arm fractures presenting to US emergency departments (EDs) using&nbsp;the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) between&nbsp;2005-2009 and&nbsp;2015-2019; (2) to compare humerus fracture locations stratified by age or sports-related trauma reported in the NEISS between these two periods.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The NEISS was used to obtain US estimates of proximal and distal arm fractures for the years 2005-2009 and 2015-2019. ED visits were identified using injury code (57: Fracture) and body codes (80: Upper Arm, 33: Lower Arm). Fracture rates were normalized using US Census Estimates and stratified by age for their respective periods. Case summaries were filtered for humerus fractures and further filtered for anatomic and non-specific (proximal, middle, distal third) fractures. Reported anatomic fractures were stratified by sports trauma and divided into non-impact and impact related trauma. Relative humerus fractures, inclusive of anatomic and non-specific locations, were stratified by age and compared between the two periods. Chi-squared test was used to compare fracture rates between the two periods. Statistical significance was set at P&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;During the two periods studied, participating NEISS EDs coded 47,066 proximal and distal arm fracture cases from 2005-2009 (1,450,335 injuries nationally; 95% CI 1,180,435 - 1,720,234), and 48,565 arm fractures from 2015-2019 (1,499,014 injuries nationally; 95% CI 1,147,809 &ndash; 1,850,219). There was a significant decrease (p&lt;.0001) in proximal and distal arm fracture rates from 2005-2009 to 2015-2019; further, there was a significant difference in fracture rates between the two periods with respect to age group distributions (P &lt; .0001). Proximal and middle third humerus fractures were bimodal in nature, with peak cases occurring between 10-14 years and 55 years and older (proximal third) or 60 years and older (middle third) for both periods. Distal third humerus fractures were right skewed, with peak cases for both periods occurring at 5-9 years. Bicycling, football, and gymnastics accounted for the top three sports related fractures, respectively, for both periods. Impact related sports trauma accounted for most fractures during both periods. Interestingly, non-impact related sports trauma consisted entirely of thrower&rsquo;s fractures resulting in primarily midshaft fractures.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Proximal and distal arm fracture rates decreased&nbsp;and distributions differed by age between the two periods in the US. Proximal, middle, and distal third humerus fracture distributions differ&nbsp;by age but were similar between both periods. One major non-impact sports related trauma was high external rotational torque from pitching, suggesting possible precautions that may protect against thrower&#39;s fractures.

Ladowski<sup>1</sup>, C. Boyd<sup>1</sup>, D. Chu<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,General Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: With the advent of social media and the associated increase in connectivity between scientists and the lay public, the Altmetric Attention Score has been created as a way to measure these interactions between scholarly publications and media dissemination. Little is known, however, whether these types of media exchanges measured by Altmetrics may serve as a proxy for public engagement. As such, we have sought to determine whether or not an association exists between Altmetric scores and public engagement, as measured by article citation in a public policy document.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The top 100 highest scoring articles in the medical and health sciences with respect to Altmetric Attention scores were selected from the years 2014 to 2016. Each article was then matched to an article from the same year and journal with the highest relative-citation-rate (RCR) for comparison. Bivariate analysis compared article groups with respect citation in a public policy document, open-access status, and funding status, as well as Altmetric and RCR scores. A multivariate model was then constructed in an attempt to correlate significant factors with public policy citation. Finally, a contour plot was generated in order to estimate the interaction between Altmetric Scores and RCR and their comparative effects on the probability of inclusion in a public policy document.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the 600 articles included in the analysis, 286 (48%) had been cited by a public policy article. The only difference that existed between cohorts was for funding status, with 55 articles (40%) in the RCR cohort having received funding compared to 81 (60%) in the Altmetric cohort (p=0.011). On bivariate analysis, both Altmetric score (p=0.0018) and RCR (p&lt;0.0001) were independently predictive of policy citation. In a multivariate model, the interaction between Altmetric scores and RCR with respect to policy inclusion was significant (OR=1.22; 95% CI=1.08 to1.38) and a contour plot demonstrates that either high Altmetric score or RCR alone is sufficient to generate a high probability of policy inclusion.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Scholarly article citation by public policy documentation may serve as a novel means to explore public engagement in scientific research. In addition, journals that aim to impact public policy through article dissemination may benefit from engagement in social media avenues in addition to traditional citation pathways in order to encourage broader inclusion.&nbsp;

Olorukooba<sup>2</sup>, M. Ahmed<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Ahmadu Bello University,Surgery,Zaria, KADUNA, Nigeria <sup>2</sup>Ahmadu Bello University,Community Medicine,Zaria, ., Nigeria","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Sexual dysfunction following reconstructive surgeries involving the urethra is a symptom that has a significant effect on a patient&rsquo;s health-related quality of life and satisfaction despite a patent urethral lumen. The urethral stricture or its repair could affect the sexual drive, ejaculatory function, and erectile function of the patient. The mere obstruction of the urethral lumen could also lead to retarded ejaculation or anejaculation, especially in complete strictures. This may also contribute independently to a decreased sexual drive or weak erection. Similarly, dissection during urethroplasties may further affect erectile function post urethroplasties. The correlation between sexual function and urethroplasties in our patients is important as well as the possible determinants of the dysfunction in our post-operative patients. This may help in the choice of approach to the repair of the stricture and preoperative counseling of patients to achieve good patient satisfaction and relief of bladder outlet obstruction.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was a cross-sectional study involving patients with urethral strictures scheduled for urethroplasties who willingly consented to study and were sexually active at presentation and postoperatively. Patients with posterior urethral stenosis or distraction defects, hypospadias, and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic prostatitis that could affect erectile function were excluded.

&nbsp;The clinical data was documented on a study proforma as well as the type of urethroplasty performed.&nbsp; These patients were interviewed and had the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory administered preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively.

Scores were calculated for each of the domains. Statistical analysis was done using descriptive, inferential, and multinomial logistic regression studies.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 45 men enrolled in the study. The mean age was 47&plusmn;12 years. Most of the patients 29(64%) had post-inflammatory strictures while 16(36%) had post-traumatic strictures. Preoperatively, 2(4.4%),3(6.6%), 20(44.4%), and 31(68.7%) patients had poor sexual drive, erectile function, ejaculatory function, and overall sexual function respectively. While only a patient (2.2%) had a poor erectile function, 2(4.4%) patients had ejaculatory dysfunction and 2(4.4%) had poor overall satisfaction postoperatively. There was however an overall statistically significant increase in the mean postoperative scores as compared to the mean pre-operative scores in all the sexual domains. On Multinomial logistic regression analysis, only age( &le;50yrs) was a statistically significant variable in the sexual domain of sexual drive with a p-value of 0.028. The site and choice of treatment were however not statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Sexual functions improve in the majority of patients after urethroplasties however, men &lt;&nbsp; 50years should be counseled&nbsp;for sexual dysfunction before urethroplasty.

We assessed effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation, treatment, and outcomes of patients with acute appendicitis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a single institution retrospective chart review to identify and collect data for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute appendicitis between March and June in 2019 and 2020. We extracted data involving patient demographics, symptoms, severity, perforation status, treatments received, and post-operative courses. Relationships between variables were assessed by calculating r correlation coefficients and performing student T-tests and Chi-squared tests as appropriate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We identified 362 patients presenting to the ED with acute appendicitis, 183 (50.6%) and 179 (49.4%) patients in the 2019 and 2020 time periods, respectively. More patients were diagnosed on imaging with a perforated appendix at presentation in 2020 compared to 2019 (20.1% vs. 11.5%, p=0.01). Longer duration of pre-diagnosis symptoms was associated with an increased likelihood of a patient having a ruptured appendix (p=0.007) and of a patient being prescribed a postoperative regimen of antibiotics (p=0.03). Ruptured appendix diagnosis was associated with a higher Alvarado score (&lt;0.001), need for surgical intervention (p=0.002), higher postoperative complications (p&lt;0.001), and higher readmission within 30 days (p&lt;0.001). Readmission rates to the ED following initial discharge increased from 4.37% in 2019 to 12.8% in 2020 (p=0.006).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Rates of persons presenting with appendicitis remain unchanged despite COVID-19. Severity rates of the disease, however, have increased during the pandemic, which may be due to delayed presentation.

Colovos<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Vermont College Of Medicine / Fletcher Allen Health Care,Division Of Trauma & Acute Care Surgery, Department Of Surgery,Burlington, VT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Surgical teaching dictates that small bowel obstruction (SBO) in a patient with no prior abdominal surgery &ndash; &lsquo;virgin&rsquo; abdomen (VA) &ndash; mandates prompt laparotomy. This is encapsulated in the adage &lsquo;let the Sun not set (or rise) on an SBO&rsquo;. The rationale is twofold: 1) etiology of the obstruction likely requires surgical therapy; and 2) the possibility of strangulation. However, SBO, even in VA, is often caused by conditions not requiring immediate surgery from adhesions, inflammatory bowel disease, etc. With high definition computed tomography (CT), it may be possible to determine the etiology of obstruction and the evidence of strangulation, and thus allow for a more selective approach to surgical exploration. The current study evaluates the accuracy of CT in determining the need for surgery for SBO in VA.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Retrospective review of all SBO in VA managed by the Acute Care Surgery service at an academic medical center over a 3-year period (2017-19). Patients with SBO in VA were identified from the Emergency General Surgery registry. Patients with SBO caused by an external hernia or without a pre-operative CT were excluded. CT reports of included patients were examined to determine 1) surgical vs non-surgical etiology, and 2) presence/absence of strangulation. CT findings were correlated with operative findings in patients that underwent surgery, and with clinical course [mean follow-up 15 months (range 10-20)] for those that did not. True/false positives (TP/FP) and negatives (TN/FN) were determined and sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive values of CT were calculated for etiology (surgical vs. non-surgical) and strangulation (present/absent).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 26 patients were included. Based on the CT results, the etiology of SBO was: non-surgical 9 (TN 8; FN 1); colonic diverticulitis 3 (TN for surgical SBO); surgical 10 (TP 9; FP 1); and indeterminate 4 (surgical 1; non-surgical 3). CT evidence of strangulation was present in 1 (TP) and absent in 25 (TN 23; FN 2). 9 patients were successfully managed non-operatively, none requiring subsequent surgery, and 17 underwent surgery during the index admission. Accuracy of CT in predicting surgical vs non-surgical etiology and presence/absence of strangulation are presented in Table.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;CT is highly accurate in determining surgical etiology of SBO in VA though lacks sensitivity for strangulation. Thus, in patients with no clinical evidence of strangulation a more selective approach to surgical management avoiding potential mortality and morbidity of non-therapeutic laparotomy is justified. It may be time to re-examine the surgical adage and &lsquo;let&rsquo; the sun rise on an SBO in VA.

Cauley<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital,Department Of Surgery,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;The impact of natural disasters and pandemic crisis, and their aftermath, on elective surgical volumes remains unknown. The goal of this study was to examine the impact of natural disasters, specifically Hurricane Sandy- a Category I hurricane that hit New York at the end of October 2012, on elective surgical volume.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Observational study of the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database from 2011-2013 was performed. Three high-volume, elective surgeries were examined in New York City and Long Island hospitals: inguinal hernia repairs, bariatric surgery, and total knee replacement surgery. Weekly volumes in 2012, as percentages of total yearly volumes to accommodate differences in volumes between years, were compared to same weeks in 2011 and 2013.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 9,364 inguinal hernia repairs, 16,695 bariatric surgery, and 42,250 total knee replacement surgery were examined. There was a 61.7%, 71.8%, and 57.6% relative decrease, respectively, during week 44. The volumes of following weeks were not significantly different than trends observed in 2011 and 2013 (Figure).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Significant decreases in elective surgical volumes were observed during Hurricane Sandy; however, there was no above-average increases in surgical volumes in its aftermath. Our healthcare systems may be operating at near capacity, with little room to accommodate unexpected volumes. The short-term needs and long-term outcomes of patients affected during natural disasters should be examined. Our findings have important implications for modeling recovery after natural disasters when elective surgical cases might need to be delayed.&nbsp;

Morris<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,General Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
In March 2020, COVID-19 appeared in the United States requiring massive shifts in operating room (OR) management. Between March 18th and April 30th all elective surgeries were canceled at our institution. In May, we resumed any CMS Tier 2a and 2b and outpatient Tier 1 cases. From mid-March until present, all surgeon block times were suspended and cases scheduled on first come, first served basis. Traditionally, surgeon block time has been a cornerstone of OR scheduling, but this current pandemic presents the opportunity to re-evaluate. Is block time the most efficient way forward?

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We collected all OR data from fiscal year 2019 until June 2020. Cases were stratified into two groups by dates performed: pre-COVID (May and June of 2019) with block time versus post-COVID (May and June of 2020) with no block time. Data was stratified by hospital location: main campus or satellite. Surgeries performed at our satellite center include outpatient and lower acuity inpatient surgeries. Operating room prime time is defined as 7 AM until 5 PM at the main hospital and 7 AM until 3 PM at the satellite center. Primary outcomes include average cases per day, case mix index (CMI), percentage of cases extending outside of prime time, and total overtime hours per month. Statistics included ANOVA for continuous variables to compare means and Chi-Square for categorical variables. All tests were conducted with an alpha level of 0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The mean cases per day in May and June of 2019 versus 2020 were not statistically significant at the satellite center (29.56 vs 31.75, p-value = 0.536) or at the main campus (78.46 vs 68.04, p-value = 0.167). Comparison of CMI in 2019 versus 2020 showed a significant increase at the satellite center (2.43 vs 2.62, p-value = 0.048) and a significant decrease at the main campus (4.97 vs 4.19, p-value = &lt;0.001). When examining the proportion of cases extending beyond prime time, there was no significant difference at the satellite center (23.9% vs 21.1%, p-value = 0.104). However, at the main campus there was a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of cases extending beyond primetime in 2019 versus 2020 (19.6% vs 15.7%, p-value = 0.001). At the satellite center, total overtime hours per month in Oct 2019 &ndash; Feb 2020 was 300.6 hours per month vs 81.8 hours per month in May &ndash; June of 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the main campus, total overtime hours per month in Oct 2019 &ndash; Feb 2020 was 2,475 hours vs 832 hours per month in May &ndash; June of 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our data indicates we are currently performing the same case volume more efficiently without the use of block scheduling as we reopen following the COVID-19 shut down.&nbsp; Additionally, lower average overtime hours per month are seen in May and June of 2020 when compared to the six months leading up to the pandemic.&nbsp; Future studies are necessary to understand the most efficient way to provide surgical care during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Glover<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Royal North Shore Hospital,Department Of Surgery & Surgical Education Research And Training (SERT) Institute,Sydney, NSW, Australia <sup>2</sup>University Of Sydney,Northern Clinical School, Faculty Of Medicine And Health,Sydney, NSW, Australia","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) surgical risk calculator provides an estimation of 30-day post-operative complications including mortality. This tool has the potential to both aid in decision-making for patients and their families, but also aid in optimising management of high-risk patients. Whilst validated within the American surgical population, its utility internationally in patients requiring emergency surgery is not yet known. This study undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the calculator&rsquo;s accuracy in predicting mortality in emergency surgery patients. According to the literature, this is one of first studies to perform a meta-analysis assessing the performance of the ACS-NSQIP calculator in an external patient cohort outside of the ACS-NSQIP database.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A comprehensive literature search was conducted between October 2019 to April 2020. The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Databases were searched for relevant studies. The search strategy included studies from January 2013 to April 2020. There were no language restrictions placed. Reference lists of retrieved articles from these databases were used to identify further studies eligible for inclusion. Two independent reviewers&nbsp;screened a total of 402 records. 66 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Six studies were included in our final meta-analysis. A random effects model was used and fitted using restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML). The O/E ratio was used to validate the calculator&rsquo;s accuracy in predicting mortality. Heterogeneity was analysed using the I<sup>2</sup> and Cochrane Q tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Six studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 1835 patients undergoing emergency surgery. &nbsp;The summary estimate of the O:E ratio of the ACS-NSQIP surgical risk calculator in predicting 30-day post-operative mortality was 1.06 (95% CI 0.74-1.51). As expected there was significant heterogeneity between studies with a Cochrane Q of 11.96 (p = 0.04) and I<sup>2</sup> = 57.5%. The forest plot analysis outlines the findings of the meta-analysis.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This meta-analysis has showed that that the calculator does have potential to be utilised in the multi-disciplinary care of patients undergoing emergency surgery. As the ACS-NSQIP surgical risk calculator is still reasonably new, there remains limited studies published in the literature attempting to externally validate its performance, accounting for this study&#39;s&nbsp;heterogeneity. As further studies publish their local results, further studies will be able to further delineate its true accuracy in international surgical cohorts

Victorino<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Francisco - East Bay,General Surgery,Oakland, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  While current management of choledocholithiasis has evolved to include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), advanced endoscopy remains technically challenging and limited in availability. Our safety net health system requires transfer to a separate facility for advanced endoscopic procedures prior to definitive surgical management. While timing to cholecystectomy post ERCP has been extensively studied, the effect of timing to ERCP from day of admission on post-cholecystectomy outcomes remains unknown. Our aim was to evaluate if an increase in timing to ERCP leads to higher post cholecystectomy complication rates.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective review of patients who received pre-operative ERCP for choledocholithiasis prior to cholecystectomy (laparoscopic or open) between 2016-2019 was conducted. Patient demographics, initial laboratory values, duration of symptoms, preoperative diagnoses, timing to ERCP from day of admission, timing between ERCP and cholecystectomy, and post-operative complications were recorded. Outcomes were analyzed using regression analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;There were 87 patients who were identified. All patients had a preoperative diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and 28% (n=24) with at least one additional diagnosis. The mean days from day of admission to preoperative ERCP was 2.40 days (SD &plusmn; 1.47), and from ERCP to cholecystectomy was 1.86 days (SD &plusmn; 1.50). On univariable analysis, we identified male sex (OR 2.95, CI 0.88-9.96, p=0.08), WBC (OR 1.10, CI 0.98-1.25, p=0.12) and timing between ERCP and cholecystectomy (OR 1.31, CI 0.95-1.80, p=0.10) as potential confounders. After inclusion into multivariable analysis, timing to ERCP was not associated with the likelihood of complications (p=0.60).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;An increase in timing from day of admission to ERCP was not associated with an increase in complications after cholecystectomy. As advanced endoscopic techniques continue to become more readily available, our findings suggest health systems can still utilize such services through other avenues such as inter-facility transfers without impacting health outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Patients (&gt;18yo) who underwent inguinal hernia repair were identified and their records were reviewed retrospectively (Jan-2010 to July-2016, n=609) and prospectively (Aug-2016 to Dec-2019, n=653) under IRB approved protocol. Value was defined as Quality/Cost and the quality of the procedure was assessed by analyzing post-operative complications using a standardized grading system where a score was given to complications grades starting with uncomplicated procedures=1, Grade 1=0.95, Grade 2=0.75, Grade 3=0.60, Grade 4=0.50, and Grade 5 (Death)=0.&nbsp; Cost was defined as total hospital charges accrued for admission and re-admission up to 30days post-discharge which were then corrected for inflation at a 5% APR. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using MATLAB software.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 1242 patients underwent open (58%) vs minimally invasive (laparoscopic 12%, or Robotic assisted 30%) inguinal hernia repairs, 81% of them were males. The mean age of all the patients was 54&plusmn;16, mean BMI was 28&plusmn;6, and 0.5% readmission rate. The unit value cost of uncomplicated outpatient laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair with no readmission was $25,165 (value unit=1).

It is of special importance in the cases of patients on pre-injury anticoagulation with traumatic brain injury (TBI) for whom the risk of intracranial bleeding is increased, and often further aggressive steps must be taken to reverse the effects of the anticoagulant. The goal was to analyze the role of reversal transfusions in TBI patients with pre-injury anticoagulation, antiplatelet or dual therapy transferred from an Acute Care Facility (ACF) to a level 1 Trauma Center (TC).


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This retrospective study analyzed 484 TBI patients transferred to TC from ACF (2016&ndash;2019) who received anticoagulation, antiplatelet or dual therapy (ACAP). Patients were divided into two groups of: 211 patients who received reversal transfusions (ACAP-R) and 273 who did not receive reversal transfusions (ACAP-NR). Following variables were analyzed: age, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Score head (AISh), transfer timing, rate of repeat CT imaging, rate of craniotomy,&nbsp; Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, Hospital length of stay (HLOS) and mortality.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;TBI patients on pre-injury anticoagulation in both groups had similar age (ACAP-R: 81.9 vs ACAP-NR: 82.6), and GCS (13.9 vs 14.1), both p&gt;0.4. ACAP-R patients were found to have higher ISS (16.5 vs 13.3) and head AIS scores with statistically significantly higher repeat CT scans (98.1% vs 90.8%), craniotomy rates (17.5% vs 3.3%), and increased ICU admissions (85.3% vs 53.0%), all p&lt;0.002. Timing from ACF trauma consultation to TC arrival was significantly shorter in ACAP-R patients (1.6 vs 1.8 hours, p=0.002) resulting in shorter overall transfer time compared to ACAP-NR (3.4 vs 3.8 hours, p=0.03). The AISh analysis revealed a significantly higher incidence of AISh 5 in the ACAP-R group compared to the ACAP-NR patients [Fig. 1], which corresponded with higher craniotomy rates (17.5% vs3.3%, p&lt;0.001), and prolonged HLOS (4.6 vs 3.2 days, p&lt;0.001). Mortality was not statistically different between ACAP-R and ACAP-NR groups (16.1% vs 12.1%, p=0.2). In addition, multivariable analysis revealed that advanced age (&ge;65 years old), GCS and AIS head were significant predictors of mortality in the ACAP population.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Transferred traumatic brain injury patients on pre-injury anticoagulation who received reversal transfusions were more severely injured, had more surgical interventions, yet had comparable mortality to as TBI patients on anticoagulation without reversal transfusions, which may be attributed to the timely administration of anti-coagulation/anti-platelet reversal therapy.

Few studies however, have explored the association of reoperation and readmission among general surgery patients. Our aim was to explore this relationship in select major abdominal operations.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) Participant Use Data Files from 2014-2018 were utilized. We assessed six groups of procedures, defined by ACS NSQIP targeted procedure codes for ventral hernia repair, colectomy, appendectomy, and proctectomy as well as small bowel resection and gastrectomy. Patients discharged &lt; day 15&nbsp;were included in the dataset. This time period was selected to reduce ACS NSQIP 30-day post-surgery follow-up bias.&nbsp; Reoperations were defined as those occurring during the index hospitalization period. The primary outcome was unplanned readmission that occurred &lt; 15&nbsp;days from date discharged. Logistic regression models were used to examine variables associated with readmission for each procedure group.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 748,156 patients were included: ventral hernia repair 36% (n=271,596), colectomy 32% (n=236,104), appendectomy 25% (n=186,560), proctectomy 4% (n=28,786), small bowel resection 3% (n=19,289), and gastrectomy 0.8% (n=5,821). Reoperation was independently associated with readmission for ventral hernia repair (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.44-3.78, p&lt;0.001), colectomy (OR 1.6, CI 1.44- 1.79, p&lt;0.001), appendectomy (OR 3.0, CI 2.34-4.05, p&lt;0.001), and proctectomy (OR 1.42, CI 1.11-1.82, p=0.005), see Figure. Other clinically relevant covariates associated with readmission were partially dependent functional status after&nbsp; colectomy (OR 1.44, CI 1.32-1.56, p&lt;0.001), proctectomy (OR 1.3, CI 1.04-1.63, p=0.02), ventral hernia repair (OR 1.9, CI 1.70-2.31, p&lt;0.001), and small bowel resection (OR 1.3, CI 1.12-1.73, p=0.003); and ASA 4/5 classification for colectomy (OR 3.0, CI 2.64-3.46, p&lt;0.001), proctectomy (OR 2.14, CI 1.51-3.02, p&lt;0.001) ventral hernia repair (OR 8.7, CI 7.27-10.60, p&lt;0.001), appendectomy (OR 3.07, CI 2.57-3.66, p&lt;0.001), and small bowel resection (OR 4.9, CI 2.72-8.91, p&lt;0.001). ASA 3 classification, age, sex, and emergency status were also associated with readmission for most procedures.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Heightened awareness of the association of reoperation, as well as partially dependent functional status, higher ASA classification, and emergency status, with readmission may improve patient care particularly for these abdominal operations.

","H. Arshad<sup>1</sup>, M. Plymale<sup>1</sup>, D. Davenport<sup>1</sup>, J. S. Roth<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Kentucky,Lexington, KY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Synthetic mesh material has been widely-regarded as the gold standard for ventral and incisional hernia repair (VIHR); yet mesh infection is estimated to occur in up to 10% of repairs over time. Bioresorbable (BR) mesh materials have been developed as an alternative to synthetic (Syn) mesh for VIHR, and are considered for use in patients with increased risk for postoperative complications. While acquisition costs of BR mesh is increased compared to Syn mesh, the long-term value inclusive of complication costs are not defined. In the present study, the purpose is to compare 30 day post-operative clinical and cost outcomes of VIHR patients dependent upon mesh type (Syn vs BR).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;With IRB approval, a single-center retrospective review was conducted including cases of emergent and elective open VIHR performed between June 1, 2013, and May 31, 2018. The local National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database and medical record review contributed perioperative variables. Cost data was obtained from the hospital accounting system. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the effect of mesh type on wound occurrences. Multivariable linear regression assessed the effect of mesh type on total costs.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;432 ventral hernia repairs were performed (99 BR and 333 Syn). ASA Class&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;3 was more common in the BR group (69.7% vs 55%, p = .010), as was age (56.8 years vs 51.7 years, p = .001). Groups were similar in BMI, tobacco use, and incidence of diabetes. The BR group had increased incidence of prior abdominal infection (31.3% vs 19.5%, p = .019), preoperative open wound (6.1% vs 0.6%, p = .002), and CDC Wound Class &gt; 1 (27.3% vs 5.1%, p = .001). Separation of components was performed more frequently in BR group (77.8% vs 44.4%, p &lt; .001).&nbsp; Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the effect of mesh type on wound occurrences with resulting odds ratio for BR mesh relative to Syn mesh was 0.72 (95% CI 0.31 &ndash; 1.67, p = .719). Mean total hospital costs were greater for the BR group ($22,609; SD = $12,541) compared to the Syn group ($15,150, SD = $14,598) (p = .001) with the medical supply costs primarily accounting for the difference between groups ($9757 vs $3584, p&lt;.001). Multivariable linear regression assessed the effect of mesh type on total 30-days costs with resulting exponentiated beta value for BR mesh relative to Syn mesh of 1.24 (95% CI 1.10 &ndash; 1.40, p &lt; .001), or a risk-adjusted 24% increase in costs over the mean.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Bioresorbable and synthetic mesh hernia repairs can be safely performed with similar 30-day clinical outcomes. Bioresorbable mesh&nbsp;repairs incur more costs during the first 30 postoperative days, primarily related to supply costs. Further studies are required to determine the long-term impact of bioabsorbable mesh upon global hernia costs inclusive of recurrence and complications.

&nbsp;Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is a widely accepted alternative to surgery in critically ill patients or those deemed high risk. Interval cholecystectomy is offered as a definite therapy for acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC). We hypothesize that PCs might be used as definite therapy for cholecystitis in elderly.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We reviewed an institutional retrospective database for patients who underwent PC placement between 2015 - 2019. Chi square analysis was used to compare different age groups.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

&nbsp;We identified 260 patients with ages between 28 and 103 years. Average age was 72.8.

&nbsp;26.5% of patients were under 65 (n=69) 48.4% over 85 (n=126) 25% between 65-85 (n=65).

11 patients were lost to follow up. ACC was the most common indication for PC. Majority of patients had ACC Tokyo grade I &amp; II.

Of patients &gt;85 who had a drain, 29.1% went on to have surgery (n=16) compared to 54.5% of those &lt;65 (n=36) (P value 0.011)

For Tokyo grade I, regardless of age, 58.6% of patients went on to have surgery. Compared to 30.2 % and 11.2% in Tokyo grades II and III respectively. (P value 0.001)

64% of patients&gt; 85, who had ACC grade I, 66.7% and 100% of patients with ACC grades II &amp; III did not have surgery. This was statistically significant in Tokyo grades I&amp; III ( P values 0.01&amp; 0.04 respectively)

&nbsp;In older patients who did not undergo surgery only 33.3% went on to have PC removed n=13.(P value 0.044)

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

&nbsp;Percutaneous cholecystostomy tubes are used increasingly in elderly regardless of severity of cholecystitis. We noticed a trend in their use as definite therapy for ACC. This was statistically significant but further studies with larger number of patients are needed to evaluate it.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in stay-at-home policies that may have impacted patients with non-COVID related illnesses. Hospitals have postponed procedures and concurrently, patients may have delays in seeking medical care. We sought to understand differences in the presentation, management, and outcomes of patients with biliary disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We performed a single institution retrospective chart review collecting data for all patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) with symptomatic biliary colic or acute cholecystitis between March and June of 2019 and 2020. We extracted data involving patient clinical factors, treatment, and outcomes. T-tests and Chi-squared univariate analyses were performed as appropriate for analysis.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

We identified 313 patients, 152 (49%) who presented in 2019 and 161 (51%) in 2020. In 2020, more patients presented with acute cholecystitis than in 2019 (50% vs. 35%, respectively, p&lt;0.05). Mean duration of symptoms prior to presentation was longer in 2020 (4.2 days vs. 2.9 in 2019). More patients were admitted to the hospital in 2020 compared to 2019 (65% vs 49%, p=0.03). Although there was no significant difference in the proportions of patients treated surgically (52% in 2020 vs. 40% in 2019), significantly more patients received antibiotics in 2020 (66% vs. 52% p=0.02).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

COVID-19 has impacted the severity and management of biliary disease at our institution. More patients presented with acute cholecystitis during the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer with biliary colic, which may be due to delays in seeking or accessing care.

We aim to evaluate the value of incisional hernia repair procedures and identify the factors that affect their cost.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Clinical variables (v=81) from patients (&gt;18yo) who underwent incisional hernia repair were retrieved from a Health System warehouse retrospectively (Jan-2010 to July-2016, n=424), and prospectively (Aug-2016 to Dec-2019, n=251) under IRB approved protocols. Value was defined as V=Q/C. Quality (Q) was assessed by grading surgical complications using a Classification System where Uncomplicated = 1 value unit, Grade 1 = 0.95, Grade 2 = 0.75, Grade 3 = 0.60, Grade 4 = 0.50, Grade 5 = 0 (death).

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using MATLAB software.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;675 patients underwent open (47%) vs laparoscopic (53%) incisional hernia repairs over a 10-year period. The ratio between males and females was 38% to 62% respectively, with the mean age of 53&plusmn;13, and mean BMI of 35&plusmn;9.

Small bowel obstructions (SBOs) have a good prognosis with early intervention, but delays in surgical or medical management may lead to worse outcomes. This study investigated the impact of COVID-19-related precautions on the presentation, treatment, and outcomes of patients presenting to the emergency department with SBO.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A single institution, retrospective chart review was performed with data for all patients who presented with SBO to our institution&rsquo;s emergency department (ED) between March 17-June 30 in 2019 and 2020. We extracted patient characteristics and clinical care data. T-tests and Chi-squared tests were performed as appropriate for comparisons.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 243 patients presenting with SBO identified between March 17-June 30, 130 (53%) during 2019 and 113 (47%) during 2020. We found that patient volume dropped 42% between March 17-May 4 of 2019 (n=60) vs 2020 (n=35), directly following the implementation of the shelter-in-place order in our county. Patients presenting during this time period had significantly higher comorbidity scores than those in 2019 (4.1 &plusmn; 3.39 vs. 5.77 &plusmn; 3.85, p&lt;0.05). There were no significant differences in ED severity scores between the two cohorts. The need for OR intervention between March 17-May 4 for management of SBO following presentation was relatively similar (22% vs 20%), however once the restrictions in shelter-in-place were eased (May 5-June 30) rates of surgical intervention were greater than 2019 (18% vs. 14%) . The rate of nasogastric (NG)&nbsp;tube placement, total length of hospital stay, and readmission for complications for repeat SBO in the 30 days following discharge did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The shelter-in-place order, hospital policy, and other COVID-19-related precautionary measures in our county were associated with fewer patients presenting to the ED for SBO but had a limited impact on SBO management and outcomes. These orders may have caused people to delay time-sensitive care, but it is reassuring that it did not appear to impact outcomes.

Divino<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>The Mount Sinai Hospital,New York, NEW YORK, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Palliative care benefits patients with life-limiting illness or at the end of life. However, studies describe continued underutilization of palliative care services in surgery. In 2012, the Mount Sinai Hospital Department of Surgery established a monthly interdisciplinary mortality council of attending surgeons and the palliative care service. This conference discusses mortalities on the surgical service or within 30 days of surgery, focusing on decision-making processes, family involvement, and patient quality of life. Our study aims to characterize the impact of this mortality council on the utilization of palliative care services by surgeons.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This is a single-institution retrospective study of all mortalities (n = 789) that occurred on the surgical service or within 30 days of surgery between June 2005 and May 2019. Mortalities before 2012 and those during or after 2012 were classified into pre- and post-mortality council groups, respectively. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were studied. Data was summarized as frequency (percentage) and compared using Chi-square or Fisher&rsquo;s exact test as appropriate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There was a difference in utilization of palliative care services pre- and post-mortality council (9.5% vs. 19.1%; p &lt; 0.0001). Palliative care referrals were not associated with emergent surgeries (p = 0.468), patient age (p = 0.189), or surgical subspecialty (p = 0.357).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our data show&nbsp;that a dedicated mortality council consisting of surgeons and the palliative care service is a useful platform to increase the utilization of the palliative care consult service by surgeons.

The mortality rate is considerably higher in countries with low resources due to multiple factors. Helicobacter pylori is a known risk factor for PUD and has prevalence rates up to 90% in developing countries. Unfortunately, diagnosis of this infection can place a significant financial burden on patients in resource-limited settings such as Ghana, where the cost of diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori is 640 Ghana cedi, versus 240 Ghana cedi for treatment alone (minimum daily wage 11.92 Ghana cedi equivalent to $2.16). The wait times for diagnosis via rapid urease testing can also be long. As such, identification of a subset of patients who can be safely treated with empiric H. pylori therapy is necessary.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We conducted a retrospective review of 1067 consecutive patients who underwent UGIE at four centers in Kumasi, Ghana between 2012 and 2015. Data extracted included age, gender, region of referral, indication for UGIE, endoscopic findings and H. pylori testing results. Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square test were performed using Excel, with p&lt;0.05 considered statistically significant.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 1067 patients who underwent UGIE, 60% were female. The average age was 44.5 years (range 9-95 years old). Patients seen at the four centers were from 12 of the 16 administrative regions, with 89% from the Ashanti region. 80% of patients presented with abdominal pain and/or dyspepsia. Of these patients, 438 (51%) were found to have endoscopic evidence of PUD/gastritis, 212 (25%) had normal findings and 19 (2%) had findings concerning for malignancy. 50% tested positive for H. pylori, 40% tested negative and 10% were not tested or results were unavailable. 51 patients presented with abdominal pain and/or dyspepsia as well as alarm symptoms, defined as vomiting, GI bleeding, weight loss or suspected malignancy. 7 (13.7%) of these patients were found to have malignancy on UGIE. Of the remaining 806 patients who did not concurrently present with alarm symptoms, only 12 (1.5%) were found to have gastric malignancy on UGIE. The difference in prevalence of malignancy between patient groups presenting with and without alarm symptoms is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;We found high rates of PUD/gastritis and H. pylori in symptomatic patients undergoing UGIE in Ghana. Empiric treatment for H. pylori in patients presenting for UGIE with abdominal pain or dyspepsia in the absence of alarm symptoms should be considered given the high prevalence of H. pylori and lower probability of malignancy in this population. Reserving UGIE and H. pylori testing for refractory cases could allow a significant number of patients to avoid the financial burden of diagnostic workup and for the reallocation of UGIE in a resource-limited setting.

Surgical infections are a major cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in low resource settings. &quot;Clean Cut&quot; is a six-month quality improvement program focused on reducing postoperative infectious complications through strengthening adherence to infection prevention standards embedded in the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist. After piloting the program in five Ethiopian hospitals, improvements were seen in each of the selected infection prevention standards as well as a reduction in risk of surgical site infections. However, long term sustainability of the program has not been assessed.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Eight Ethiopian hospital completed the Clean Cut program between 2015-2019. Adherence to Clean Cut standards were assessed during a month baseline period and continuously monitored afterwards, with 30-day outcomes obtained for all enrolled patients. Between 6-18 months after completion of the program, a two-week sustainability evaluation was undertaken at seven of eight hospitals using the same direct observation of infection prevention practices, which included six process measures: surgical safety checklist compliance, hand hygiene and skin preparation, instrument decontamination and sterilization, antibiotic prophylaxis, gown and drape integrity and sterility, and gauze counting. Compliance to a standard was assessed. For each observation, 100% of expected behaviors had to be performed correctly to be considered compliant to each process measure. Data were entered into DHIS2 and analyzed using Stata v16.1. ANOVA was used to assess differences between groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

From the seven hospitals included, a total of 3385 patient encounters were include, 738 from pre-implementation, 2184 post-implementation and 463 from the sustainability audit period. Between the pre- and post-implementation period, compliance with each infection prevention area improved significantly, with the exception of antibiotic administration. The sustainability audit period showed further improvement in use of the Surgical Safety Checklist (72 to 78%), surgical linen integrity (14% to 44%) and gauze counting (95% to 98%). The other three process measures showed some attrition in compliance but remained far above baseline.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The Clean Cut program has resulted in significant improvements in proper infection prevention practices in multiple Ethiopian hospitals with subsequent reduction in risk of surgical infection. This sustainability evaluation demonstrates the behavior changes made as a part of Clean Cut are persistent and in some cases continue to improve. Wider implementation and its study in different contexts is a valuable investment in improving patient safety and infection prevention behaviors over the long term.

In 2013, approximately eight million children (&le;19years old) died from injury-related mortality, with the majority of deaths occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In Uganda, there is a paucity of granular epidemiologic data describing the burden of pediatric trauma. Detailed mapping of national patterns of injury is essential for resource allocation, surgical workforce planning and more. This study aimed to ascertain the burden of non-adolescent pediatric trauma across four hospitals in Uganda.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We performed a trauma-specific sub-analysis on a prospectively-collected pediatric surgical dataset across four hospitals in Uganda: Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH), Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH), Soroti Regional Referral Hospital (SRRH) and St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital Lacor (SMHL). Data were collected at each site during varying time periods between 2012 and 2019. Pediatric trauma patients aged 12 years or younger were included in the analysis. Descriptive statistics, including patient demographics, clinical features, management and outcomes, were performed in RStudio (Version 1.2.1335).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Data was collected from a total of 693 pediatric trauma patients, across four hospital sites: MNRH (n=245), MRRH (n=29), SRRH (n=292), SMHL (n=127). The majority of patients were male (63%), with a median age of 5 [IQR=2, 8]. Patients travelled a median of 25km, 57.5km, 19km and 40.8km to reach MNRH, MRRH, SRRH and SMHL, respectively, and patients at MNRH were from the most varied regions across the country. Chiefly, patients suffered injuries due to falls (16.2%), road-traffic crashes&nbsp;(RTCs) (14.7%) and burns (10.5%). Across sites, patients most commonly incurred abdominal trauma (29.4%), contusions (11.8%) and burns (10.5%) (Figure 1). At SRRH and SMHL, 26.7% of patients had long-bone fractures, with a high prevalence of femoral fractures treated with traction. Overall, the majority of patients underwent surgery (55%) and recovered (95%), with no post-operative/treatment complications. Twelve patients died during the study timeframe, all at time of presentation or before surgical treatment was rendered.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

In Uganda, non-adolescent pediatric trauma patients suffer traumatic injuries most commonly due to falls, RTCs and burns, resulting in high rates of abdominal trauma, long bone fractures and burns. Amidst surgical workforce deficits and resource-variability, there is an urgent need to cement robust long-term clinical data collection for ongoing pediatric injury surveillance. Up-to-date data regarding national patterns of injury is essential to inform future efforts to strengthen pediatric trauma care in Uganda.

Murray<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Missouri,School Of Medicine,Columbia, MO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Timely empiric and prophylactic antimicrobial therapy are a critical part in achieving positive patient outcomes in almost every medical specialty. Antimicrobial selection is challenging as providers must use&nbsp;agents that have an adequately wide spectrum of action, while being weary of increasing antimicrobial resistance. The American Urological Association (AUA) has&nbsp;antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines for patients undergoing urologic surgery. For transurethral procedures, AUA generally recommends&nbsp;the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or cefazolin (CEPH) for perioperative prophylaxis. The most commonly isolated organism in infection after such procedures is Escherichia Coli.&nbsp;We sought to investigate the appropriateness of these empiric antibiotic choices through a nationwide sample of antibiograms.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We searched for publicly available statewide antibiograms for every state. When differentiated, we preferentially used urinary antibiograms.&nbsp;If a state&rsquo;s data was not publicly available, we reached out to the state Department of Health (or similar entity) to grant us access to this data. For states that were still unable to provide this data we used available data from flagship public medical schools within the state.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Twenty-one states had publicly available statewide antibiograms or provided us with similar data. For 12 states, we were able to substitute institutional data from a public medical school. The remaining 17 states have not responded to our query, denied us access, or do not collect this data and do not have available medical school data. Analysis of state antibiograms show considerable variability in antimicrobial resistance of urinary microbes. For&nbsp;E. coli,&nbsp;average susceptibility was 84% (range 58-94%) to 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;gen CEPH and 75.5% (range 62-90%) to TMP/SMX (Figure 1).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Infection after transurethral procedure can be serious and proper perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis has been shown to decrease this risk. We assessed the appropriateness of AUA guideline recommended empirical choices, TMP-SMX and CEPH, in the prevention of perioperative&nbsp;E. Coli&nbsp;infection. The predicted efficacy varies greatly among agents and amongst states. For example, North Carolina was the state with the lowest&nbsp;E. Coli&nbsp;susceptibility to CEPH at 58%. However, TMP-SMX is also a questionable choice here as only 72% of&nbsp;E. Coli&nbsp;isolates were susceptible to TMP-SMX. Overall, we show that there is significant geographic variability in antimicrobial susceptibility to AUA guideline recommended perioperative antibiotics for transurethral procedures, suggesting that either no empirical advice should be given or that another antimicrobial class may be preferred.&nbsp;

In several settings, perioperative gabapentinoids have exhibited opioid sparing effects. In preparation for a randomized trial, we performed a retrospective analysis and a prospective pilot to assess the feasibility of studying perioperative pregabalin in ureteroscopy with stent placement.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;After IRB approval we performed a retrospective chart review of eligible patients (Table 1) who underwent ureteroscopy with stent placement. We then performed a prospective pilot in this same patient population to evaluate the feasibility of using 300mg pregabalin just prior to ureteroscopy and stent placement. All these patients had a standardized post-op regimen consisting of diclofenac, mirabegron, belladonna and opium, and acetaminophen. We evaluated patient centered outcomes including pain scores and patient satisfaction after surgery and opioid use in the post-operative period.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The retrospective review of 13 patients found that all received an opioid prescription at discharge and 38% had a readmission or emergency room visit within 30 days of surgery.&nbsp; The prospective trial enrolled 10 patients. Seventy percent were male with a median age of 37.5 years. Despite counseling to the contrary, 30% of these patients expected to need opioids after surgery. One hour after surgery, the mean (SD) pain score was 1.5 2.1 on a 1-10 visual analog scale. The only adverse effects reported more than once were pain (30%) and dry mouth (60%) post-operatively. All patients went home the day of surgery and no patient was prescribed opioids at discharge. One patient (10%) had emergency room visits leading to readmission within 30 days and was given opioids at that time.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Using a systematic approach involving several interventions including perioperative pregabalin, we were able to decrease discharge opioid prescribing from 100% to 0% in ureteroscopy with stent placement with no observed adverse effects. We will soon begin a randomized controlled trial to specifically evaluate the role of perioperative pregabalin in this setting.

Rangel Brando<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Universidade Federal de Cincias da Sade de Porto Alegre,Porto Alegre, RIO GRANDE DO SUL, Brazil","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

The struggle of women for representation in Medicine is arduous. One of the first obstacles was the right to attend medical school. In recent years, there has been a consistent trend towards the feminization of Medicine in Brazil, with an increase in the number of women who graduated each year, so that, in 2017, 45.6% of medical professionals working in Brazil were women. However, despite the expressive growth in numbers, new challenges are faced by Brazilian female doctors, especially in surgical specialties. For this reason, the present work aims to draw a general overview of women in surgery in Brazil to better understand how far we are from gender equity in this area.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Publicly available data were collected to assess the prevalence of women in surgery and leadership positions in the surgical area in Brazil. It was assessed the prevalence of women: in 13 surgical specialties according to data from &ldquo;Medical Demography&rdquo;, in positions of professors of surgery among 32 Brazilian medical schools, in 163 leadership positions in 10 Brazilian surgical societies, and a position of authorship of 792 publications of the main Brazilian journal of surgery (CBC journal).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

In the analysis of 13 surgical specialties, 10 had female participation below 25% in 2018. The only ones with a percentage above 25%, but still below 50%, were: coloproctology, pediatric surgery, and mastology with 30.7%, 40.7 %, 49.3%, respectively. Among the 32 medical schools analyzed, 25 had professors from the surgery department listed on the school&#39;s website. At these universities, 383 professors of surgery were found, of which 340 (88.77%) were men and 43 (11.23%) were women. Only 3 universities (12%) had women as head of the surgery department, while 22 (88%) had this position held by men. In the analysis of 163 positions in 10 Brazilian surgical societies, only 14 positions (8.59%) were held by women. This under-representation of women is even more expressive in the highest positions (presidency and vice-presidency), as only 1 (5%) of these positions were held by a woman. In the research area, women represented only 27.8% of general authorship, 25% of the first authorship, and 21.8% of senior authorship.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

It is perceived, in general, that the increase in the number of women doctors who graduated each year is not reflected in a greater insertion of women in surgical specialties. The path of women who choose to walk in surgery is full of obstacles, so that the proportion of women in leadership positions is low, whether in the heads of the surgery department of university hospitals, in the positions of Brazilian surgical societies and scientific research in Brazil. Thus, it appears that there is still a large gender gap in surgery and its subspecialties. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more studies to understand the causes of this situation and how we have evolved towards gender equity in Brazilian surgery.

In low- and middle-income countries, dedicated burn registries are few. Instead, burn data are often recorded in logbooks or as one variable in trauma registries, where incomplete or inconsistently recorded information is a known challenge.&nbsp;The University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (CHUK) hosts the only dedicated burn unit in Rwanda and has collected data on patients admitted for acute burn care in logbooks since 2005. This study aimed to assess the data registered in these logbooks to evaluate the extent of missing data, and to identify possible factors associated with &ldquo;missingness&rdquo;.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All patient information recorded&nbsp;in the CHUK burn unit logbooks between January 2005 and December 2019 was analyzed using descriptive statistics.&nbsp;Statistical significance (considered at p-value &le;0.05) in the correlation of various factors and the presence of missing data was calculated using Fisher&#39;s exact test. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for differences in medians of continuous variables. Stata IC 16.0 was used for statistical analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In this study, 1,093 acute burn patients were included and 64.2% of them had incomplete data. Data completeness improved significantly over time. The most commonly missing variables were whether the patient was referred from another facility (n=381/1093, 34.9%)&nbsp;and information regarding whether any surgical intervention was performed (n=432/1093, 39.5%). Missing data on burn mechanism (p=0.008), burn degree (p=0.010), and surgical treatment (p=0.014) were&nbsp;associated with in-hospital mortality.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Missing data is frequent for acute burn patients in Rwanda, although improvements have been seen over time. As Rwanda and other low- and middle-income countries strive to improve burn care, ensuring data completeness will be essential for the ability to accurately assess the quality of care, and hence improve it.&nbsp;

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a major cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in low resource settings. In Ethiopia, the pooled prevalence of SSI is 25% and reducing this burden is a priority for the Federal Ministry of Health. Clean Cut is a six-month quality improvement program focused on reducing postoperative infectious complications through strengthening adherence to perioperative infection prevention standards. While antibiotic stewardship is a key component of this, the patterns of postoperative antibiotic administration are not well known or studied. We evaluated the administration of postoperative antibiotics during the course of the Clean Cut program.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The Clean Cut program was implemented in 8 hospitals in Ethiopia from 2015 to 2019 including prevention strategies such as improved adherence to perioperative antibiotic prophylactic guidelines. Clinical data regarding the types of antibiotics administered, timing of administration, administration duration, complications, indications and SSI were collected by trained personnel via direct observation. Data were analyzed using Stata/IC version 16.1. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared and ANOVA tests were used where appropriate to determine differences between groups. &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of 3122 postoperative patient encounters at 8 hospitals, over half (51%) of patients received postoperative antibiotics, and about one third of antibiotic administrations were for postoperative prophylaxis. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic was ceftriaxone (38%), including for postoperative prophylaxis (67%), treatment course (92%) and infectious complications such as SSI (76%), pneumonia (50%) and UTI (50%). Other antibiotics such as ampicillin and metronidazole were also frequently prescribed both for prophylaxis and treatment.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

While the Clean Cut program focuses primarily on perioperative antibiotic administration (i.e. just before skin incision), other perioperative infection prevention and control practices such as postoperative antibiotic stewardship provide opportunities for further quality improvement initiatives. The frequent use of ceftriaxone for postoperative prophylaxis likely does not follow local or societal guidelines and should be examined as part of a comprehensive infection control and antibiotic stewardship strategy. Further examinations of practices by surgical procedure, wound class, and known resistance patterns are ongoing.

Our hypothesis is that current financing mechanisms in Guatemala do not address key barriers to the provision of surgical care for children within UHC schemes.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a qualitative analysis of the financing of surgical care for children in the public health system in Guatemala by surveying key informants (n=20) in the medical, financial, and political sectors. We interpreted qualitative results and dominant themes (Figure 1) in the context of national financing data and health system reports, and generated a set of recommendations to improve the financing of surgical care.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We found several macro-level challenges to financing for surgical care for children, including complex political contexts, health finance system fragmentation, and lack of earmarked funding for surgical care. Micro-level challenges include lack of provider agency in non-personnel funding decisions, as well as families functioning both as financing agents and beneficiaries. Although formal user fees are not used in Guatemala, informal fees for surgical services are common barriers to care.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The financing of pediatric surgical care in Guatemala faces complex macro- and micro-level challenges that must be systematically addressed to advance UHC for children through increasing access to timely, affordable, and safe pediatric surgical care.&nbsp;Recommendations to improve surgical financing for children and improve alignment with UHC schemes include increasing use of technical financial data, strengthening national and local organizational structures for financing, reduction of informal user fees, and use of innovative financing instruments, such as resource pooling between health system actors.

However, in Haiti, due to a&nbsp;lack of specialized centers with qualified staff, and the lack of health education for&nbsp;the general population, patients arrive at the hospital at an advanced stage of the disease which can make the diagnosis and surgical treatment of the disease challenging.&nbsp;The aim of this study is to describe the outcomes for a cohort of patients who received an operation for Hirschsprung&#39;s disease in Haiti.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The pediatric surgery team at the only pediatric hospital in Haiti performed a retrospective study of all Hirschsprung operations performed between January 2017-January 2020. Patient data analyzed included demographic information, including driving distance from the hospital, pre-operative vitals, diagnostics and laboratory workup, type of operation, post-operative complications.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over the course of this study, 20 patients presented with Hirschsprung&#39;s&nbsp;disease and 14/20 (70%) were male. In our study 6 or 30% of patients lived within a 2-hour driving distance to the hospital. The median age at diagnosis was 2.57 (IQR 0.8,5.3). The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal distension (85%) and chronic constipation (80%). Only 2 patients had additional diagnosed&nbsp;congenital anomalies. All the patients received a contrast study and the main type of Hirschsprung&rsquo;s diagnosed was of the rectosigmoid (65%) followed by short segment disease (25%). Pathological diagnosis of Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease was obatined&nbsp;before surgery in&nbsp;40% of the cases. Half of our patients had a colostomy (50% right and 50% left) before the final pull through procedure, and the other half underwent an immediate primary pull through procedure. The Soave procedure&nbsp;was used for all the patients in which 55% had a differed (after 8 days) coloanal anastomoses. The other 45% had immediate coloanal anastomoses. The main complications of patients who received a colostomy was prolapse occurring in 60% of patients (4 right, 3 left). The main complications after the Soave procedure&nbsp;were pelvis abscess (25%), skin infection 20%, fistula 20% and enterocolitis 15%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is one of the few studies from Haiti exploring post-operative outcomes for patients with a diagnosis of Hirschsprung&#39;s disease. We saw a high postoperative rate of prolapse (60%) for patients who received colostomies prior to their final procedure and a quarter of our patients had pelvic abscesses after the Soave procedure. The treatment of Hirschsprung&#39;s disease has evolved considerably and thanks to intraoperative biopsies&nbsp;treatment without a colostomy or one step procedures&nbsp;are becoming more and more common in developed countries.&nbsp; In Haiti, this in&nbsp;not always possible and colostomies are often used prior to the final procedure.&nbsp; However as seen in our cohort&nbsp;postoperative complications remain high. Future work will be aimed at exploring how we can improve our postoperative outcomes.

Global public health security is defined as the activities required to minimize the danger and impact of acute public health events that endanger people&rsquo;s health. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of surgical, anesthesia, and obstetric (SAO) care with over 28 million elective surgeries cancelled globally and a significant mortality burden. The pandemic also underlines the essentiality of SAO systems as surgical equipment, infrastructure, and workforce are reallocated toward pandemic mitigation. The purpose of this study is two-fold: 1) quantify the amount of global health security funding allocated toward SAO care, and; 2) assess the relationship between global health security funding and surgical system capacity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective review of global health security funding disbursed between 2014 and 2020 was performed using the Georgetown Global Health Security Tracking database. Funding for projects with individual country recipients that were specifically allocated toward SAO care were identified. Funds distributed to NGOs or multi-country projects were excluded but represented only a small fraction of total funds. Project descriptions were searched for mentions of surgery, anesthesia or obstetrics using locale-sensitive character matching. Surgical capacity was analyzed using SAO provider density and SAO procedure volume. Two linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the association between SAO-related funding and both SAO provider density and SAO procedure volume, adjusting for GDP per capita. Multiple imputation was used for missing data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Between 2014 and 2020, US$230 billion was allocated for 78,404 global health security projects in 177 countries. Of those, 571 projects were related to SAO care across 86 countries, with US$1.56 billion committed and US$1.25 billion disbursed. Of funding committed to SAO projects, 41.6% of funds related to surgery were disbursed. There was no association between the amount of funding a country receives to support SAO care and its SAO capacity when adjusting for GDP per capita (p=0.66 for SAO provider density; p=0.84 for surgical volume).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Despite&nbsp;less than 1% of total global health security funding is allocated to SAO projects, the US$1.56 billion committed represents a substantial funding stream for SOA care in LMICs. This funding is vital in the context of constrained fiscal health expenditure due to the COVID-19 induced global recession. The high rate of non-disbursed funds may be due to the complexity of systems required for SAO care. A coordinated global funding mechanism, such as the Global Surgery Foundation (GSF), could improve the distribution of global health security funding aimed at improving SAO care. Ultimately, SOA-related funding should be expanded to ensure access to essential SAO care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to optimize national COVID-19 mitigation strategies.

Globally, 5.8 million people die each year as a result of trauma, accounting for over 10% of the world&rsquo;s deaths, with a higher mortality rate than malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined. Over 90% of these deaths occur in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). A major contributing factor to the high trauma incidence and burden in LMICs is the inconsistent degree of injury surveillance initiatives in hospitals. Trauma quality improvement efforts are largely dependent on the development of accurate and reliable trauma registries. Routine clinical data collection can guide hospital and public resource allocations, improve staff preparedness and reveal potential areas for improvement in the management of trauma cases. However, the creation and maintenance of trauma registries and subsequent interventions in LMICs are often precluded by the lack or complete absence of trauma care monitoring tools.

Hospital-based data collection has been shown to be an effective method of improving trauma surveillance in resource-limited settings. However, the effort and time required for the design and maintenance of large trauma registries can represent a significant challenge for hospitals in LMICs. A paucity of&nbsp;data regarding important determinants of trauma such as risk factors, patient outcomes and injury patterns can limit quality improvement efforts. Pilot programs in Uganda, Cameroon, Paraguay and Guatemala have shown promising improvements in traumatic injury data collection as a result of implementing electronic trauma registries.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We performed a needs assessment to determine whether a trauma electronic medical record application (T6 Platform) could be implemented at a major trauma center in Havana, Cuba. Ten focus group meetings were held with the leadership of general surgery and emergency medicine to discuss barriers and solutions to implement the T6 Platform. Site visits were also conducted by visiting medical students to better understand trauma team dynamics and patient flow through the emergency department.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Recurrent concerns from a thematic analysis of focus group transcripts include: Time required for data entry at the bedside, lack of hospital WiFi for data storage and the need for paper records to comply with hospital policy. Feasible solutions to these problems include using medical students or nurses to scribe patient information into T6, setting up an internal hospital server for data storage, widening the compatibility of the app in mobile devices&nbsp;and continuing to print&nbsp;patient records concurrently. A simplified list of trauma documentation elements specific to this trauma center&#39;s needs that would facilitate data entry was also created.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Implementation of an electronic medical record for trauma patients is feasible provided significant pre-implementation changes are made to adapt the application to the current trauma team workflow.

The circulation restrictions implemented to prevent the spread of the virus around the globe have already caused changes in the daily lives of hospital centers. One of them was the reduction of surgical procedures. This study aims to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the number of surgical procedures, both urgent and elective procedures, performed in Brazil, through a temporal analysis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Data on hospital production from the Unified Health System (DATASUS) were compiled for emergency surgeries and elective surgeries performed from January 2008 to May 2020, by SUS in Brazil. Using the IBM SPSS software, the minimum monthly values ??expected from the 149-month series were generated for each of the categories of procedures surveyed (p &le; 0.05).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The number of surgical procedures performed in Brazil, through the Unified Health System (SUS), between January 2008 and May 2020, was 52,464,767, with a monthly average of 352,112.53 procedures. 31,169,015 of the total number were urgent procedures and 21,295,752 were elective. The monthly average of urgent procedures was 209,188.02. The minimum expected per month, according to the series analyzed, was 205,805.58 procedures (p &le; 0.05). However, in March, April, and May 2020, 203,780 , 154,069, and 99,261 emergency surgeries were performed, respectively. Among the elective surgical procedures, in the same period, there was a monthly average of 142,924.51. The minimum expected per month, according to the series, was 138,982.53 (p &le; 0.05) elective surgeries. However, in March, April, and May 2020, 121,492, 34,485, and 28,424 procedures in this category were performed, respectively. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The increase of COVID-19 cases in Brazil was followed by a decrease in the number of elective and urgent surgical procedures, with the biggest falls in elective procedures from April to May 2020. Some possible consequences for these events: negative impacts in patients who may suffer from worsening illnesses due to the lack of elective surgeries; for doctors in training, a lower volume of surgical procedures can affect the teaching and learning experience; the effects can also be reflected in the cost-benefit level for the health system, due to the lack of maintenance of the surgical volume, which is an important source of revenue for hospital centers. Thus, future studies will be needed to assess the consequences of this scenario, within surgery, to mitigate effects on the population served by the health system.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; COVID-19 has upended the field of medicine. There are concerns that fear of exposure coupled with state-wide stay-at-home policies may have resulted in delays of care and worse outcomes, particularly for patients with acute care surgery (ACS) conditions. We aim to describe differences in disease severity at presentation for the four most common ACS diagnoses before and after the stay-at-home period and to analyze whether there is an associated difference in outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Primary data collection for all surgery consults from a single institution&rsquo;s emergency department (ED) for appendicitis, cholecystitis, small bowel obstruction (SBO) and diverticulitis during March-May of 2019 and 2020 was performed. Each patient was assigned anatomic severity grades using the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) anatomic grading scale. Primary outcomes were disease counts and severity. Postoperative outcomes were analyzed secondarily. Statistical tests of differences between years included Chi-squared, Fisher Exact, or Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between March-May of 2019 (N=118) and 2020 (N=89), 207 patients were analyzed. Patient volume decreased by 25% from 2019 to 2020. Figure 1 demonstrates a 59% and 41% reduction in appendicitis and cholecystitis cases respectively, an increase of 29% in SBO cases, and an almost equal number of diverticulitis cases. A greater proportion of the SBOs were malignant in 2020 (9% vs 24%, p=0.12). The distribution of AAST descriptive grading (median: 1) or median length of symptoms prior to presentation (4 days, IQR: 3-6) showed no differences between years. While a significantly lower proportion of patients underwent an operation in 2020 as compared to 2019 (43% vs 58%, p&lt;0.05), operation rates were not different after stratifying by diagnosis. For patients receiving an operation, AAST operative grades trended higher in 2020 (median 1 vs 2, p=0.07). There was no difference in length of stay, immediate or 30-day outcomes or ED or hospital readmissions between the years.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While there was a decrease in the number of patients presenting to the ED for common ACS conditions during the stay-at-home period, there was no significant difference in overall disease severity. Those that did seek care and required an operation trended towards having more severe AAST operative grades, but had no differences in outcomes. Future work will combine data from multiple institutions and review trends prior to 2019. This early work demonstrates the influence of COVID-19 on patient behavior while suggesting that despite these changes, ACS outcomes have not worsened.

In the age of COVID-19 and enforced&nbsp;social&nbsp;distancing, changes in nationwide patterns of trauma have been observed but are poorly understood. Our aim is to characterize traumatic injury mechanisms and activation levels in 2020 compared to years prior at our level 1 trauma center.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Trauma patients activated between 2016 and 2020 from the months of January to May were reviewed. Patient demographics, level of activation (1 vs. 2), and mechanism of injury were collected. Data from 2016-2019 was combined, averaged by month, and compared to data from 2020 using chi-squared analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
During the months of interest, there were 992 trauma patients triaged in 2020 and 4,311 in 2016-2019. The rates of penetrating and Level 1 trauma activations in January, February, and March of 2020 were similar to average rates for the same months during 2016-2019. In April 2020, however, there was a significant increase in the rate of penetrating trauma compared to the prior three-year average (27% vs. 16%, p &lt; 0.002) despite comparable numbers of patients triaged. Level 1 trauma activations in April 2020 also increased, rising from 17% in 2016-2019 to 32% in 2020 (p &lt; 0.003). These findings persisted through May of 2020 with similarly significant increases in penetrating and high-level trauma.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In the months after COVID-19&rsquo;s initial spread, there has been a perceptible shift in patterns of traumatic injury. This significant increase in penetrating and high-acuity trauma may implicate a change in population dynamics, demanding a need for thoughtful resource allocation &ndash; of both PPE and personnel &ndash; at trauma centers nationwide in the context of a global pandemic.

","M. V. Platter<sup>1</sup>, D. Tamura<sup>1</sup>, S. Castle<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Valley Children's Hospital,Fresno, CA, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of California - San Francisco,San Francisco, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;During the COVID-19 pandemic, many states issued unprecedented &ldquo;Stay at Home&rdquo; orders forcing parents and children to quarantine in their homes. Some reports during this time saw interesting changes in trauma patterns hypothesized to be the result of higher rates of non-accidental trauma (NAT) as parents and children sheltered in place. Early in the pandemic, studies from China demonstrated that people experienced increased levels of psychological distress when they were quarantined at home. Additional studies have shown that mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression, in parents are associated with higher levels of child abuse. Thus, we hypothesized that children in California&rsquo;s Central Valley would experience higher rates of NAT during the official California &ldquo;Stay at Home&rdquo; order as compared to the previous year.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective chart review was performed using our institution&rsquo;s Trauma Registry. Patients, ages newborn to 21 years old, who were admitted to Valley Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Madera, CA, for suspected or confirmed NAT from March 2019 to June 2020 were selected for our study. We then looked at the rates of NAT from May 19 2020, when California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stay at Home&rdquo; order was officially placed, to May 30. We compared these rates to the same time period, March 19 to May 30, during the previous year. To further analyze the characteristics of NAT during these two periods, we also compared the age of patients, total length of hospital stay, length of stay in an intensive care unit, injury severity score (ISS), and type of injuries sustained.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Our study identified a total of 30 patients admitted for NAT between March 2019 and June 2020. Of those, eight patients were identified during the quarantine time frame, while 12 were identified in the same time frame from the previous year. Using an unpaired t-test, the means of the above stated categories were compared to determine statistical significance. The results showed that the average age of patients in the quarantine group was significantly higher, with a mean difference of 34.8 months (p=0.03, SD=14.82). For total length of stay, PICU length of stay, and ISS, we found no significant difference between time periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Pediatricians have been concerned that the rates of NAT may increase during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the high levels of psychological distress in parents forced to quarantine with their children. However, our study found that children in California&rsquo;s Central Valley were not susceptible to higher rates of NAT or more severe injuries during quarantine. While our data did not support our original hypothesis, it did show that the children admitted for NAT during quarantine were older than children from the previous year. This difference in age has not previously been reported, and future studies may be warranted to further examine this difference.&nbsp;

By the end of April, CA had the fifth highest cases in the United States (US). Furthermore, reports have suggested increased firearm violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study determined the impact of COVID-19 and shelter-in-place (SIP) orders on firearm purchases and violence in the US and CA, hypothesizing increased firearm purchases and violence.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective (1/1/2019-4/30/2020) comparison of COVID-19 cases to firearm purchases, incidents, injuries, and deaths was performed. COVID-19 data was obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Databank, firearm purchase data from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and firearm violence data from the Gun Violence Archive. Mann-Whitney U Tests were performed for firearm incidents, deaths, and injuries before (1/22/2020-3/18/2020) vs after (3/19/2020-4/31/2020) SIP orders in CA. Binomial logistic regression was performed comparing the mean difference (&Delta;&nbsp;) for SIP vs non-SIP jurisdictions for February 2020 vs April 2020.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Nationally, firearm purchases in March 2020 increased 33.6% vs February 2020 and 42.4% compared to March 2019. In CA, March 2020 had a 72.4% increase in the rate of firearm purchases (March 164,497 vs February 95,430) [Fig 1] and a 33.7% increase from March 2019. In CA, when comparing before vs after SIP, median firearm incidents were significantly greater after SIP (8 vs 9, p=0.046), whereas median firearm deaths (3 vs 4, p=0.97) and injuries (5 vs 3, p=0.34) were similar. However, nationally comparing SIP to non-SIP jurisdictions there were no differences in mean &Delta;firearm incidents, deaths and injuries (all NS).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Nationally, COVID-19 cases and firearm purchases increased during March 2020. In CA, firearm incidents showed an increase after SIP orders. However, nationally SIP orders did not affect firearm incidents, deaths and injuries.

According to the WHO, each year more than 5 million people lose their lives to injury-related deaths, of which over 90% occur in low and middle-income settings. Given the large burden of trauma in Ethiopia, both the international community and the Ethiopian Ministry of Health are motivated to improve local trauma care. ALERT Trauma Center is one of two designated trauma centers in Ethiopia and has maintained a basic trauma registry on patients presenting to the trauma unit since 2016. The objective of this study was to characterize patient demographics, injury type and severity, and outcomes to provide further context for improving care for the injured in Ethiopia.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A total of 12,816 deidentified records from the ALERT hospital trauma registry from September 2016-March 2019 were collected and reviewed. Patients were stratified by injury severity,&nbsp;&ldquo;red&rdquo; as the most and &ldquo;green&rdquo; as the least severe. Data were analyzed using Excel v16.39 and Stata v16.1. Descriptive statistics and chi-squared or t-tests of significance were used as appropriate to compare groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of the 12,816 patients included, median age was 27 (SD 15) and 74.9% (9,568) were male. Ten percent (1,329) of patients arrived by ambulance, 26.4% (3,299) by taxi, and 32.4% (4,039) self-presented. Of the 480 &quot;red&quot; patients,&nbsp;31.6%&nbsp;presented by ambulance. After triage, 36.6% (4,187) of patients were sent to the waiting area, and 37.5% (4,291) to the resuscitation area. Soft tissue injuries (5,647, 52.1%) and fractures/dislocations (2,489, 23.0%) were the most common injuries. The majority (67.5%) of patients were stabilized and discharged and few (57, 0.5%) died in the ED. Data incompleteness posed a significant limitation, such as 99.7% of patients (12,776) missing information on the mechanism of injury.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Analysis of the first three years of the ALERT trauma registry highlights several areas of potential improvement. The small proportion of critically injured patients arriving by ambulance highlights gaps in the prehospital care system and opportunities for more robust ambulance services and communication networks to expedite patient transport. Furthermore, about a third of critically ill patients were sent to the waiting room after triage, emphasizing the need for staff trauma training and restructuring of triage systems so that patients are immediately allocated to the appropriate level of care on arrival. A more detailed trauma registry with information on physiologic data and interventions should be used in the future, and staff trained to improve data completeness. This registry will continue informing quality improvement programs as part of a national initiative to strengthen trauma care in Ethiopia.

Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) is an invasive procedure used to treat selective peritoneal malignancies. Despite high reported rates of postoperative morbidity, little is known regarding the impact of complications on hospital-costs (HC) for CRS/HIPEC procedures.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We queried the HCUP-National Inpatient Sample to identify patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC between 2004 and 2013. HC were compared among patients with no complications (NC), minor (MiC) and major complications (MaC). Univariable analysis and multivariable generalized linear mixed models were used to describe associations of HC with patient and hospital characteristics.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of 993 patients that underwent CRS/HIPEC 428 (44.9%), 547 (55.1%) and 284 (28.6%) reported NC, MiC, and MaC respectively.

Patients with MaC had a significantly higher HC when compared with NC and MiC group ($48,930 vs $37,120 vs $30,094, respectively, p&lt;0.001). See Figure 1. Large and medium bed-size hospitals were associated with higher median costs than small bed-size hospitals ($35,803 and $31,072, respectively, vs. $28,345, p=0.005). Urban&nbsp;hospitals also had higher HC when compared to rural ($33,845 vs. $25,707, p=0.051). Race, payer status, hospital teaching status, and hospital volume were not significant predictors of elevated HC.

In multivariable analysis adjusting for age, Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI), length of stay (LOS), number of procedures per patient (NPP), bed-size, and location, MaC and MiC were associated with a significantly higher cost (14.7% and 6.1% more expensive, respectively, both p=0.001) when compared to the NC group. The adjusted mean cost for a patient with a MaC was $34,899 (95% CI: $28,846-$42,222), with a MiC was $32,574 (95% CI: $26,931-$39,400), and the adjusted mean for a patient without a complication was $30,691 (95% CI: $25,373-$37,124). LOS, NPP and CCI were also associated with increased adjusted costs (all p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We report the first adjusted hospital-cost analysis of complications after CRS/HIPEC using a major national database. As expected, postoperative complications have a significant impact on HC. MaC is associated with an overall increase in HC of over 60% in comparison with NC. When adjusted for CCI, LOS, and NPP, the increase of HC with MiC and MaC was 6% and 15% respectively.

In patients with liver metastases/hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), portal vein embolization (PVE) and selective internal radiation therapy utilizing Yttrium-90 (Y90) are both used to induce hypertrophy in the future liver remnant (FLR) and increase eligibility for curative intent resection. Little is known however, about the financial burdens of each procedure. We sought to define the total cost of care for patients undergoing PVE and/or Y90 followed by curative intent hepatectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective review of all adult patients undergoing PVE, Y90, and PVE/Y90 with hepatectomy was conducted between 2013-2020. Data for all relevant radiologic and surgical costs for both the index hospitalization and any readmission within 90 days was collected. Clavien Dindo Classification (CD) captured complication severity and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) captured comorbidity burden. Total combined cost for liver directed therapy, surgery, and procedure-related complications was the primary outcome of interest. Fisher&rsquo;s exact test, Chi-squared, and ANOVA were employed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Out of 25 patients, 18 were included in the final analysis; 72% (n=13) were male and the mean age was 59 +/- 14 years. Primary cancers included colon cancer (78%, n=14), cholangiocarcinoma (11%, n=2), and HCC (11%, n=2). Prior to curative intent hepatectomy, 12 patients underwent PVE, 3 underwent Y90 and 3 underwent both PVE and Y90. 61% (n=11) of the patients had a complication following either IR procedure or surgery. The mean cost was $36,254 &plusmn; $6,281 (standard deviation) for PVE patients, $83,292 &plusmn; 12,562 for Y90 patients and $127,934 &plusmn; 12,562 for Y90 + PVE patients. Bivariate analysis demonstrated that type of liver directed therapy, intraoperative blood loss, CCI, CD were associated with a statistically significant increase in cost.&nbsp; Controlling for age, CCI, and estimated blood loss (EBL), multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients who underwent both PVE and Y90 prior to curative intent hepatectomy and those with CD &gt; 4 had a statistically significant increase in cost (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This is the first study to compare the cost of care for patients receiving PVE, Y90, or both followed by curative intent hepatectomy and demonstrated that patients who underwent both PVE and Y90 procedures prior to hepatectomy and those who had severe postoperative complications (CD &gt; 4) had statistically significant higher cost. This study did not demonstrate a cost difference in Y90 versus PVE, however, validation with a larger dataset is needed.

Kane<sup>2</sup>, H. Mogal<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>Medical College Of Wisconsin,Radiology,Milwaukee, WI, USA <sup>1</sup>Medical College Of Wisconsin,Surgical Oncology,Milwaukee, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Incidentally detected appendiceal abnormalities, herein termed appendiceal incidentalomas (AI), are an understudied entity&nbsp;with unknown prevalence of neoplastic disease. The primary aim of this study is to describe the frequency and radiologic characteristics of appendiceal incidentalomas. The secondary aim is to determine the accuracy of diagnosing AIs as neoplasms based on imaging.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Electronic health records for patients at a single institution undergoing abdominopelvic CT or MRI between 2000 and 2020 for non-appendix related clinical diagnoses with mention of appendix abnormalities in the radiology report, were reviewed and diagnosis at index imaging recorded (Fig. 1). Radiographic characteristics were blindly assessed retrospectively.&nbsp;Final surgical pathology diagnosis was the gold standard for diagnostic accuracy in patients treated surgically.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 5,197 patients with an appendiceal abnormality, 485 (9.3%) were identified as AIs. Neoplasms were diagnosed radiographically in 16.5% (n=80), dilated appendix in 17.9% (n=87), and thickened appendix in 4.5% (n=22) (Fig. 1). Mucinous neoplasms were all well-circumscribed, with a mean diameter of 21.2 mm (SD &plusmn;11.7), mean wall thickness of 3.6 mm (SD &plusmn;1.5), and mean luminal fluid density of 18.5 HU&nbsp;(SD &plusmn;8.3). 27% had calcifications, and none had adenopathy, fat stranding, or peri-appendiceal fluid noted. Overall, 16% (77/485) of AIs were resected. 59% (47/80) of AIs radiographically diagnosed as neoplasms were resected; 68% (32/47) were pathologically confirmed&mdash;29 as mucinous and 3 as non-mucinous neoplasms. 7% (29/405) of AI without neoplastic radiological diagnosis were resected;&nbsp;21% (6/29) were neoplasms at pathology.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Appendiceal incidentalomas are not infrequently detected in patients undergoing CT or MRI for non-appendix related clinical diagnoses, with a vast proportion being managed without surgery. Pathology-confirmed neoplasms are diagnosed radiographically with relatively high accuracy. Further studies are needed to analyze long term outcomes in patients with incidentalomas managed non-operatively as they may have important implications for clinical management and surveillance.

Spadoa<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre,Porto Alegre, RIO GRANDE DO SUL, Brazil","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  In 2020, the pandemic scenario of Serious Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused by coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) completely changed the dynamic of health services in Brazil, with the major share of available resources being directed to the treatment of affected patients.&nbsp;Furthermore, since the institution of social distancing as a preventive measure of contagion by COVID-19, many patients have avoided seeking medical assistance, both in primary care and in hospital emergencies.&nbsp;Thus, the risks related to the pandemic have imposed on the brazilian health system a possible impact on cancer screening, with evidence of reduced diagnosis and surgical treatments of pediatric cancer patients, the hypothesis that was verified in this study.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Data from DATASUS (database of the Brazilian Unified Health System in Brazil) were analysed for the total number of cancer diagnosis in 2019 and 2020 and, afterwards, in the 0-19 age group, with an annual statistical projection calculated for 2020. In sequence, data on the total number and the daily arithmetic mean of oncologic surgical procedures in pediatric cancer in the same age group in Brazil, between the years 2018-2020, were evaluated in the same platform. Statistical analyzes were performed using the software IBM SPSS Statistics.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;In 2019, 515,733 new cancer cases were diagnosed in Brazil, with 15,214 of these patients aged 0-19 years. In 2020, the total number of diagnoses up to the 9th of July was 154,573, with only 3,983 of those cases belonging to the 0-19 age group. Based on these data, the total estimate of pediatric cancer diagnoses (0-19 years) for 2020, in Brazil, is approximately 7,632, showing a reduction of 49.83% in relation to the previous year. As for surgical treatment, during the year 2018, 2,624 surgeries were performed to treat pediatric cancer; during 2019, there were 3,391 procedures. The daily average of surgeries performed was 7.2 in 2018 and 9.3 in 2019. During the year 2020 until June 23, 716 surgeries were performed, with a daily average of 4.09 procedures, corresponding to a reduction 43.2% compared to 2018 and 56% compared to 2019.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The coronavirus pandemic has fully impacted health services, influencing management of pediatric cancer patients. The decrease both in diagnosis an in surgical treatments of pediatric cancer is multifactorial, and the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the factors to be considered. For some patients, this scenario may be associated with late diagnosis or failure to perform life-saving surgeries. Therefore, the need to intensify the diagnostic process is highlighted, with in-depth studies on the influence of COVID-19 in this context, since the postponement of cancer diagnosis limits the chances of treatment and cure.","Clinical/Outcomes","COVID-19","Oncology"

Turaga<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Chicago,Department Of Surgery,Chicago, IL, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Chicago,Medical Scientist Training Program,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Recurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers after surgery often leads to poor quality of life and death after a short period of time. If detected early, cancer recurrence can be treated with chemotherapy or cytoreductive surgery. However, current techniques used to detect minimal residual disease after surgery lack sensitivity and have not been shown to improve survival.

&nbsp;

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and cell free DNA (cfDNA) are emerging as avenues to detect the completeness of surgical resection. As technologies to detect ctDNA/cfDNA improve, it is important to understand the relationship between these potential biomarkers and recurrence of cancers. We thus performed a systematic review and patient level meta-analysis to examine the current evidence regarding the utility of the change in ctDNA/cfDNA prior to and after tumor resection in informing the recurrence of GI cancers.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A systematic protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020186096). Two independent reviewers systematically reviewed relevant articles on the PubMed database published between 1/1/2010-5/15/2020. Inclusion criteria were adults &gt;18 years of age with GI cancer treated with curative intent surgery and measurement of ctDNA/cfDNA collected both before and after surgery. Exclusion criteria were case reports/series and studies of patients who had received chemotherapy prior to surgery, but after the preoperative ctDNA/cfDNA sample was collected

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The search strategy retrieved 3873 articles out of which 1778 articles were reviewed for eligibility and 5 studies were included. Between the 5 studies, 57 GI cancer patients (20 gastric, 37 colorectal) had measurement of preoperative and postoperative levels of ctDNA/cfDNA (Figure 1). Median follow-up time was 36 months (IQR 19-44.5). Among patients with negative ctDNA/cfDNA levels before and after surgery (- to -), 85% (17/20) had no recurrence throughout the length of the studies. Among patients with positive ctDNA/cfDNA levels before surgery but negative levels after surgery (+ to -), 54.5% (12/22) had no recurrence throughout the length of the studies. In contrast, only 20% (3/15) of patients with positive ctDNA/cfDNA levels both before and after surgery (+ to +) had no recurrence throughout the length of the studies.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Increased levels of ctDNA/cfDNA, either preoperatively or postoperatively, as well as the change in level of ctDNA/cfDNA may be correlated with decreased recurrence free survival. Thus, perioperative measurement ctDNA/cfDNA may be a useful tool for informing the prognosis and need for further treatment of GI cancers. Validation of these findings should be confirmed with a multi-institutional prospective registry study.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;National cohort study of 11,620 patients with resected, locally advanced esophageal and GEJ cancer (i.e.:&nbsp;&ge;cT2 and/or cN+) treated at 1023 hospitals within the National Cancer Database (2006 - 2015).&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients were categorized as receiving surgery alone, upfront surgery followed by any form of adjuvant therapy, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is endorsed by national guidelines as the preferred MMT approach, hospitals were categorized as high utilizers based on the proportion of patients treated (neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for&nbsp;&ge;75% of patients). Hospitals were also categorized as high MMT utilizers (any MMT for&nbsp;&ge;75% of patients).&nbsp;&nbsp;The association between treatment approach, hospital practice pattern, and overall risk of death was evaluated using multivariable cox shared frailty modeling.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 12.9% of patients were treated with surgery only, 10.9% with upfront surgery and adjuvant therapy, 68.7% with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and 7.5% with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the study period, the proportion of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (66.5% in 2006 vs 78.3% in 2015; trend test, p=0.02) significantly increased, while surgery alone (15.2% vs 7.0%; trend test, p=0.02) and surgery followed by adjuvant therapy (13.3% vs 7.6%; trend test, p=0.01) significantly decreased.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean hospital-level utilization rates of the various treatment approaches were unchanged over the study period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative to patients treated with surgery alone, those treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a lower risk of death (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% Confidence Interval [0.76-0.98]).&nbsp;&nbsp;By comparison, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (HR 1.12, 95% [1.03-1.22]) was associated with a significantly increased risk of death.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upfront surgery followed by adjuvant therapy was not associated with risk of death.&nbsp;&nbsp;Care at high neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy utilizing hospitals and high MMT utilizing hospitals was not associated with risk of death.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Although neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is recommended for patients with esophageal and GEJ cancer, one in five patients are still treated with upfront surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the context of our current findings and ongoing uncertainty about whether neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be the preferred MMT approach, further studies are needed to define the optimal MMT approach for patients with locally advanced esophageal and GEJ cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Retrospective cohort study using the NCDB. The study includes individuals with localized pancreatic carcinoma who underwent resection. The analysis utilized Kaplan-Meier, logistic-regression, and Cox proportional-hazard models.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The study included 7,846 patients; 1,553 received neoadjuvant radiation, and 6,293 received neoadjuvant multiagent chemotherapy. Median follow up was 23 months. During the study period, there was increased use of neoadjuvant multiagent chemotherapy and a decline in the use of neoadjuvant radiation therapy (p &lt; .0001; r= 0.13). Overall, the groups were well balanced. However, individuals were more likely to receive neoadjuvant radiation if they were Black (OR 1.35; CI 1.09-1.69, p &lt; 0.001), &gt; 75 yo (OR 1.70; CI 1.25-2.31, p &lt; 0.001), uninsured (OR 1.88; CI 1.20-2.94, p &lt; 0.001), or from a low-income area (OR 1.35, CI 1.04-1.76, p &lt; 0.0001). Neoadjuvant multiagent chemotherapy was associated with improved survival on univariate (28.5 vs. 23.9 months, p &lt; .0001) and multivariate analyses (OR 0.79; CI .73-.85, p = 0.0002). Downstaging was similar between neoadjuvant radiation and neoadjuvant multiagent chemoradiation groups (44.7% vs. 39.0% respectively). Downstaging following neoadjuvant multiagent chemotherapy was associated with improved survival (HR 1.44, CI 1.31-1.58, p &lt; 0.0001). However, downstaging following neoadjuvant radiation is not associated with a survival advantage (HR 1.11; CI 0.96-1.28, p=0.89).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Clinicians have rapidly adopted neoadjuvant multiagent chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer in the&nbsp;absence of prospective randomized data.&nbsp; In alignment with this clinical intuition, neoadjuvant multiagent chemotherapy results in improved survival when compared to neoadjuvant radiation.&nbsp; Although the rates of downstaging and complete pathologic responses are similar, response translates into increased survival only when the regimen includes effective systemic therapy.

Previous national studies have reported racial and socioeconomic disparities in gastric cancer (GC) care.&nbsp; The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the performance of adequate lymph node (LN) assessment (&ge;15 LNs) during resection for GC within a healthcare system servicing a socioeconomically disparate, mostly non-White population in the Southeast United States.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing curative intent resection for GC between 2003-2019 was performed.&nbsp; Predictors of adequate LN assessment with relation to patient and tumor characteristics were analyzed with logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among 202 patients who underwent resection for GC, 57 (28.2%) were White and 145 (71.8%) were Black or Hispanic. Adequate LN assessment was performed in 104 (51.5%) patients. On univariate analysis, younger age, non-White race, lower Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), male gender, higher AJCC stage, surgeon dictated intent to perform lymphadenectomy and receipt of neoadjuvant therapy were associated with adequate LN assessment (all p&lt;0.05). Insurance status, income, date of diagnosis, obesity, surgical approach and tumor grade were not associated with adequate LN assessment (all p&gt;0.05).&nbsp; On multivariable analysis, non-White race (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.31-5.31), CCI &le;4 (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.12-3.97), stage III disease (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.29-5.91) and surgeon intent (OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.86-6.52) were independent predictors of adequate LN assessment.

These innate challenges make safety-net hospitals important in understanding how to improve access to cancer care in order to fit the needs of vulnerable patients and ultimately improve their outcomes. The purpose of this study is to characterize the impact of the establishment of a multidisciplinary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) clinic at Ben Taub Hospital (BTH), a safety-net hospital in Houston, Texas.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective chart review was performed to compare the demographic characteristics, clinicopathologic data, treatment strategies and outcomes of 304 patients diagnosed with HCC at BTH between January 2012 and December 2014 (group A) and 246 patients diagnosed with HCC between January 2015 and December 2017 (group B) after the establishment of a multidisciplinary HCC clinic.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Demographics were similar between the two groups.&nbsp; Group A had a higher percentage of patients presenting with multiple tumors (60% vs 53%).&nbsp; Compared to group A, a smaller percentage of patients in group B presented with stage 2 disease or greater (59% vs 69%) and fewer presented with stage 4 disease (12% vs 31%).&nbsp; Additionally, in patients with solitary tumors, the mean size of the tumor was larger in group A than group B (4.97 cm vs 3.98 cm).&nbsp; Fifty-four (22%) patients in group B were seen and 37 of them (69%) treated in the multidisciplinary HCC clinic compared to 175 (58%) patients treated in Group A.&nbsp; Treatments, including trans-arterial chemoembolization, ablation, resection, transplant, radiation and sorafenib, were similar between groups.&nbsp; Of those patients that were treated, a higher percentage of patients in group A died of their disease (42% vs 30%) and were lost to follow up (62% vs 24%) compared to group B.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Most patients with HCC presented to this safety net hospital with advanced disease, however, after establishment of a multidisciplinary HCC clinic, fewer patients presented with advanced disease, died of their disease and were lost to follow up. Screening programs and multidisciplinary teams to detect and treat HCC at an earlier stage continue to be essential for successful long-term outcomes in a resource strapped hospital with limited access to liver transplantation.

Surgeons will be required to provide synoptic documentation of essential oncologic elements within operative reports. Prior to designing and implementing an electronic tool to support synoptic reporting, we sought to evaluate current documentation practices within our health system to understand our baseline compliance with the new standards.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We identified melanoma WLE and colon cancer resections performed in our health system between 1/1/2018&ndash;12/31/2018 to ensure adequate follow-up. 100 sequential operative notes meeting CoC inclusion criteria were reviewed for melanoma, and 100 for colon cancer resection. 4 colon resections were excluded per criteria. Two independent reviewers evaluated notes for compliance with each CoC element. For WLE, 3 elements were evaluated: Breslow thickness, clinical excision margin, and dissection down to fascia. For colon resection, 2 elements were evaluated: tumor location and extent of lymphovascular resection. An operative note was considered 100% compliant if all required elements were documented. Descriptive statistics were performed in R, and a Kappa score was calculated to assess for interrater reliability (IRR).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;All melanoma WLE were performed by a single surgeon; compliance was 98% (n=98/100). Missing elements were either Breslow thickness or dissection to fascia. In contrast, for the 5 surgeons performing colon cancer resections, compliance was 69% (n=67/96). The 29 noncompliant notes failed to specify the extent of lymphovascular resection. Compliance rates varied between the 5 surgeons; individual compliance rates were 39% (n=8/19), 63% (n=10/15), 70% (n=7/10), 76% (n=28/36), and 94% (n=15/16) (Fig. 1). For WLE, despite 96% agreement, as no records were rated noncompliant by both reviewers there is decreased utility of the IRR of -0.015. For colon, the IRR was 0.78.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This study demonstrates heterogeneity in current documentation practices with varying rates of observed surgeon compliance with the CoC operative standards. At present the required documentation elements are interspersed within the operative report, which poses challenges to chart abstraction for evaluation, with resulting imperfect interrater reliability. This presents an exciting opportunity to innovate and improve compliance by introducing an electronic synoptic documentation tool.

Integrated genomics will be key to discovering areas of therapeutic susceptibility in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs), for which few effective therapies are available. However, not all populations are poised to benefit from these studies, as large-scale genomic analyses have consisted of mostly Caucasians. The goal of this study was to evaluate ethnic populations represented in genomic studies of GEP-NENs.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the python package Pypdf4 was used to determine the frequency of the words &ldquo;Race,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ethnicity,&rdquo; &ldquo;African American,&rdquo; &ldquo;Black&rdquo; &ldquo;Hispanic,&rdquo; &ldquo;Latino,&rdquo; &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; &ldquo;Native American,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pacific Islander&rdquo; &ldquo;Caucasian,&rdquo; and &ldquo;White,&rdquo; in 75 published original research manuscripts performing sequencing on GEP-NENs gathered by a systematic review of the literature.&nbsp;Subject numbers by ethnicity were then evaluated following NLP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;0/9 studies conducting epigenetic sequencing included any words evaluated, while 9/45 and&nbsp;1/21&nbsp;studies conducting whole genome/whole exome DNA or&nbsp;RNA sequencing studies did, respectively. DNA sequencing studies included 5.3% (12) African-American subjects (n=1, where n = # of studies reporting subject demographics), 0% Hispanic/Latino subjects, 27% Asian subjects (n=2), 0% Native American/Pacific Islander subjects, 8.3% &nbsp;&ldquo;Other&rdquo; (n=3), and 90.6% Caucasian subjects (n=5) (p= &lt;.001).

Clinical and demographic parameters were compared between NAT, AT only, and surgery only cohorts using Wilcoxon rank sum or Fisher&rsquo;s exact tests. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate RFS and OS distributions. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models were used to compare RFS and OS between the groups adjusting for stage. &nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 110 patients recorded, 48 patients received AT, 12 received NAT, and 12 received surgery only, of which the majority had angiosarcoma of the breast (38.9%), followed by head and neck (22.2%), soft tissue (20.83%), and viscera (18.06%). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in clinical and demographic parameters such as age, gender, grade, primary site, or stage. 47 patients experienced recurrence: 36 patients who received AT, 7 NAT patients, and 4 surgery only patients. &nbsp;The median RFS (in years) was 6.2 for NAT, 1.3 AT only, and 4.3 for surgery. The estimated 5-year OS probabilities were 64.2%, 53.0%, and 66.7% in these groups respectively. In multivariable analysis, AT only patients had a statistically significant worse RFS as compared to surgery only patients (HR 2.34; CI 1.05-5.27, p-0.04), presumably related to selection bias. Clinical stage was the most important predictor of recurrence regardless of the type of perioperative therapy, with Stage 3/ 4 patients having over two-fold relative risk of recurrence compared to Stage 1/2/x patients (HR 2.34, CI: 1.06-5.17, p=0.0355 NAT vs. AT only; HR 2.45, CI: 1.23-4.89, p=0.01 for AT only vs. surgery).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We found that the majority of AS patients received adjuvant therapy. Patients who received AT had the shortest RFS as well as higher recurrence rate. These findings may be explained by a lower rate of R0 resections in these groups. Our findings are hindered by the small sample size and duplicates in groups. Further research is needed to assess the relationship between perioperative therapy on surgical margin status as well as and RFS and OS.

Aprahamian<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Children Hospital Of Illinois / OSF Saint Francis Medical Center,Pediatric Surgery,Peoria, IL, USA <sup>2</sup>University of Illinois College of Medicine,Pediatric Surgery,Peoria, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Neonates are a high-risk population in need of focused care. Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) remains a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Recently, there has been an increased recognition of the importance of intestinal immunity and the impact of probiotics, antibiotics, enteral feeds and infection in NEC. The primary purpose of this study is to examine the impact of enteral feeds on the survival of premature neonates with NEC. The secondary goals are to assess the correlation between feeds and other health factors (bacterial infection, probiotics usage).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review using the Vermont Oxford Network database for a Level IV NICU from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2019 was performed. All neonates had a gestational age between 22-29 weeks, weighed at least 300 grams (n=653), and were treated for NEC (n=43).&nbsp;The cohort was subdivided into groups based on enteral feeding status at discharge: fed (n=571) and not fed (n=82).&nbsp;Data was analyzed using chi-squared analysis for NEC rate and Bacterial Infection while a fisher&rsquo;s exact test was utilized for mortality rate and probiotic usage (*p&lt;0.05 significant).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The incidence of NEC in the population was 6.6% (43/653). Of the 43 neonates treated for NEC, 27 were enterally fed, while the other 16 were not (see Table 1). All 27 neonates with NEC that were able to achieve enteral feeds by discharge survived and had an infection rate of 22.2%.&nbsp;Meanwhile, all 16 neonates with NEC that were unable to achieve enteral feeds throughout their hospitalization died and had an infection rate of 62.5%. The usage of probiotics in the population was not significantly different.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In conclusion, there is a significant impact of enteral feeds on NEC, survival and infection rates in premature neonates.&nbsp; These findings support the impact of intestinal immunity and the microbiota in NEC. Given the limitations of the retrospective review, the profound survival advantage with enteral feeds reinforces the need for further study.

There is a paucity of data on watersport injuries in pediatric patients, with limited nationally representative studies. This study queried a national database to describe watersport related injury prevalence, mechanisms, and patterns.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2016 Kids&rsquo; Inpatient Database. Cases were patients age &lt;18 years with an ICD-10 diagnosis code of watersport injury. These were compared to patients &lt;18 years admitted for any other traumatic injury. Characteristics were analyzed using ICD-10 codes. Data were weighted for national representativeness.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were a total of 330 admissions. Compared to other trauma admissions, patients with watersport injuries were older (mean 12.6 vs 8.4 years, p&lt;0.01), primarily Non-Hispanic White (72.8% vs 45.7%, p&lt;0.01), with private insurance (68.3% vs 39.9%, p&lt;0.01) and in the highest income quartile (36.9% vs 20.1%, p&lt;0.01). Watersport injuries often occurred in summer (67.5% vs 26.9%, p&lt;0.01) and required more major surgical procedures (69.8% vs 39.9%, p&lt;0.01). The top three injuries were lower extremity fracture (27.8%), intracranial injury (19.8%), and extremity open wound (17.2%). The most common procedures were repairs of hip/femur fracture (15.2%), lower leg fracture (12.4%) and face/skull fracture (7.4%). The most common mechanisms were powered boat (23.5%), other watersport/watercraft (20.4%), and rowing, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, tubing (18.3%). Patients injured from powered boats were more often admitted to the ICU as compared to other watersport/watercraft and rowing, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, tubing (17.6% vs 4.0% vs 6.7%, respectively), and had a longer length of stay (8.7 vs 3.3 vs 5.0 days, respectively), as well as a higher mean number of diagnoses (7.5 vs 4.8 vs 5.1, respectively) and procedures (4.0 vs 1.6 vs 2.3, respectively).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Watersport injuries are a significant cause of injury often requiring a major surgical procedure. The most common mechanism was a power boat in the summer. Approximately one quarter had a head injury or lower extremity fracture. Future studies focused on boating safety may prevent these injuries.

Gaines<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Pittsburgh,School Of Medicine,Pittsburgh, PA, USA <sup>2</sup>Children's Hospital Of Pittsburgh Of UPMC,Division Of Pediatric General And Thoracic Surgery,Pittsburgh, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Firearm injuries remain a public health crisis. Approximately 19 children die or are treated for firearm injuries per day in the United States. Studies have shown sociodemographic differences between individuals injured intentionally versus non-intentionally.<sup> </sup>However, it remains to be seen whether differences exist within firearm injuries specifically, and which sociodemographic characteristics are most predictive of unintentional or intentional firearm injuries.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients 0-18 years-old treated for a firearm injury at a freestanding, urban children&rsquo;s hospital between 2008-2018 were included (n = 160). Injuries from air-powered, gas-powered, and pellet guns, and non-penetrating injuries associated with firearms were excluded.

Firearm injuries were identified in the hospital&rsquo;s trauma registry. The registry was queried by free-text and external cause of injury codes. Injuries were dichotomized into intentional and unintentional. Sociodemographic variables were collected from medical and social work notes, and from online and social media sources.

Characteristics between intentional and unintentional injuries were compared using Chi-square, Fisher&rsquo;s Exact, and Mann-Whitney U-tests. Leveraging techniques from information theory,&nbsp;attributes of injuries and injured individuals were compared to determine which characteristics were most discriminative between groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 160 injuries were identified (57 unintentional, 4 self-inflicted, 99 assaultive). Self-inflicted and assaultive injuries were grouped as &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; for analysis. Children injured intentionally were likely to be older (mean age: 13), Black, publicly-insured, live in a single-parent household, have a parent incarcerated, have problems at school, be involved in a gang, and have a prior psychiatric diagnosis (p &lt; 0.05). Those injured unintentionally were likely to be younger (mean age: 10), White, privately-insured, and living in a dual-parent household (p &lt; 0.05). They were less likely to have a parent incarcerated, have problems at school, be involved in a gang, or have a prior psychiatric diagnosis (p &lt; 0.05).

Comparisons between the groups on sex, mortality, removal of the child from the home, previous involvement with Child Protective Services, number of children living at home, parent employment status, alcohol involvement, positive CRAAFT score, and prior involvement in firearm trauma were not statistically significant.&nbsp;

Age, race, and insurance status were the most discriminative between unintentional and intentional firearm injuries. Sex, prior involvement in firearm trauma, and removal of the child from the home were least discriminative.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our study demonstrates sociodemographic differences between unintentional and intentional firearm injuries in children. However, these groups were similar across variables, including sex and prior involvement in firearm trauma. Thus, reduced firearm access for all children could decrease rates of both unintentional and intentional injuries.

Petroze<sup>1</sup>, J. A. Taylor<sup>1</sup>, M. M. Mustafa<sup>1</sup>, S. Islam<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Florida,Pediatric Surgery,Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major cause for morbidity that predominantly affects premature neonates and has a spectrum of severity. A small proportion present with massive intestinal ischemia termed as NEC totalis (NEC-T) which carries almost universal mortality. Due to the relative rarity, there are very small series reported. The ability to distinguish NEC-T from NEC is limited and the purpose of this study is to try and understand factors that would help to predict NEC-T.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Neonates with NEC were identified over a 9 year period. Data was collected from the day of diagnosis and for 7 days preceding. Laboratory, imaging, clinical, operative, and outcomes data were collected. NEC-T was defined as less than 10 cm viable bowel on exploration, while cases requiring surgical intervention were defined as severe NEC. The cohort was then stratified and analyzed to assess for predictive factors for NEC-T compared to other surgical cases.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 210 patients had a diagnosis of NEC, with 150 (71.4%) treated medically. Severe NEC was noted in 60 cases that required any surgery, and 16 of those were found to have NEC-T. Twelve cases had less than 5 cm of viable bowel, while 4 had between 5 and 10 cm. Between the NEC surgical group and the NEC-T group, there was no significant difference in gestational age, birth weight, APGAR, laboratory data from the day preceding diagnosis, blood transfusions, breast milk use, antibiotic use, and day of life of NEC diagnosis. There was also no difference in pre diagnosis respiratory or cardiovascular failure requiring support. NEC-T cases had a higher number on &gt;80% enteral feeds (68.8% vs. 38.6%, p=0.045), higher proportion on Medicaid insurance and increased number with distention at diagnosis (100% vs. 88%). NEC-T cases progressed from initial onset to needing surgery significantly quicker (1.88 vs. 7.0 days, p=0.03). Mortality was 100% for NEC-T and at a mean of 1.5 days from diagnosis, compared with 38% and 15.6 days for NEC surgery.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: NEC-T was uncommon, but uniformly and rapidly lethal in this single center series which is one of the largest. Gestational age in this series was similar to non NEC-T as was age at presentation. There was minimal clinical differentiation between NEC-T and the severe cohort other than more rapid progression of the disease, underlining the need for maintaining a high index of suspicion. Further analysis and multicenter studies would be helpful in creating diagnostic guidelines.

Pediatric firearm injuries are the third leading cause of child death nationwide, and rates of pediatric firearm injuries have not shown significant improvement over the last decade. In the US, almost 20,000 children a year present to the ED for firearm related injuries with a rate of 23.9 injuries per 100,000 children. Previous research has shown that firearm injuries are more commonly intentional than unintentional. Younger children have the highest rates of unintentional injury.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between demographic factors and intentionality in pediatric gunshot wounds (GSWs). We hypothesize that our midwestern Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center (PTC) provided care for more intentional than unintentional firearm injuries.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This is a retrospective, single site study from an urban, midwestern level I PTC. The demographics of the metro area are 19.7% Black or African American, 71.7% Non-Hispanic White, and 4.7% Hispanic or Latino of any race. We reviewed charts for patients ages 0-17 who sustained firearm injuries from January 1, 2016-December 31, 2018. We queried the pediatric trauma registry and EMR using ICD10 external cause codes to identify GSW patients.

Unintentional injuries are defined as GSWs that occur due to accidental discharge or without violent intent. Intentional injury is defined as discharging a weapon with violent intent, regardless of intended victim.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Between January 2016 through December 2018, 110&nbsp;GSW patients presented to our Level 1 PTC.

Of these GSWs, 81 are categorized as intentional, 15 unintentional, and 6 did not have enough information to determine intentionality. There are distinct racial differences in intentionality. No White patients were victims of intentional injury; in contrast, 82% of Black patients were victims of intentional injury. Boys were disproportionately affected in comparison to girls in the number of&nbsp; injuries, making up 79% of total injuries. However, rates of intentionality were approximately equal (Table 1). As age increases, both the total number of injuries as well as the rate of intentional injuries rises. Of note, two patients were shot twice and two patients were shot three times during the study period.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

There are significant racial disparities in both the number of pediatric GSWs as well as the intentionality. Black children are the victims of intentional gun violence at much higher rates than White children. Overall, higher rates of intentional than unintentional firearm injury aligns with previous research on this subject.

In 2017, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) established the Children&rsquo;s Surgery Verification (CSV) quality improvement program, a set of standards to improve surgical care in children. The CSV Appendix 2 outlines 36 perioperative events/outcomes required for hospital verification and necessitates unique institutional mechanisms for data collection. Outlined is our process for meeting these requirements.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
In 2019, our tertiary children&rsquo;s hospital applied for Level 1 ACS CSV. We reviewed our sources and mechanism of data acquisition for Appendix 2 to meet the requirements for verification.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Six data sources were utilized. The electronic medical record [Cerner] and hospital [variance] reporting systems were the primary sources for manual data extraction, comprising 26/36 (72%) variables required for CSV (Table). Four data points (11%) were obtained from preexisting department committees/reports (code review committee, blood bank report, extracorporeal life support report). Additional data points were abstracted from commercial data repositories utilized by our hospital (Vizient, Solutions for Patient Safety, Pediatric Health Information System). Many variables were cross-referenced against secondary sources for validation. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, which contains sampled patients and only eight relevant variables, was not sufficient as a primary data source and was instead used for data confirmation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
A multi-source approach allowed our institution to capture the variables required for ACS CSV application. However, almost all variables required manual extraction and/or confirmation. Automated data extraction systems for all of Appendix 2 do not exist, but would improve efficiency and accuracy.

In response to the opioid epidemic, many efforts have focused on reducing opioids. However, few data assess the impact of opioid reduction practices&nbsp;on managing pain in the postsurgical pediatric population. Balancing measures, defined as visits to the Emergency Department (ED) or communication with providers after surgery, may help clinicians identify patient cohorts where a decrease in prescribed opioids resulted in inadequate pain management after ambulatory surgical procedures. This study evaluates and describes balancing measures identified from a two-week postoperative visit of patients who only received non-opioid analgesics to manage postoperative pain in a pediatric tertiary care hospital.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

IRB approved retrospective review of postoperative clinic template (opioid dotphrase) from 2/15/2018 &ndash; 11/8/2019 was used for analysis. Electronic health record (EHR) collected data included analgesic use after surgery, side effects and self-reported efficacy of pain management. Patients/caregivers reporting no postoperative opioids had their charts verified for accuracy. Charts were also reviewed for balancing measures (ED visits/communication with providers), medication changes or refills during the two-week time period between surgery and the post-surgical visit.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Opioid dotphrase review identified 541 postoperative patients who were not prescribed an opioid at discharge and were treated at home with non-opioid analgesics only. Only 55 patients (10%) reported visiting the ED and/or making a telephone call to their providers about postoperative pain. The most common age category communicating pain concerns in descending order were: late childhood (5-12 years), adolescents (13-17), early childhood (1-4) and infancy (&lt;1 year old). The most common procedures where patients reported pain concerns in descending order were: laparoscopic appendectomy (n=14), circumcision (n=8), umbilical hernia repair (n=5), inguinal hernia repair (n=4), and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n=4). Of the 18 patients who visited the ED between the time of surgery and the postoperative visit, 5 were admitted and 2 received morphine during that visit. None of the 55 patients with identified balancing measures had an addition of an opioid to their medication regimen. Interestingly, six (11%) of the balancing measures (all phone calls) occurred after the two-week postoperative visit and none of these patients reported pain at their postoperative visit.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The majority of children using a non-opioid analgesic to manage postoperative pain did not have documented balancing measures related to inadequate pain management. Balancing measures are an important component to assess, as efforts to decrease opioid use do not conflict with efforts to treat pain in children. Identifying common surgeries with insuffiecnt&nbsp;postoperative pain management provides an opportunity to re-evaluate analgesic prescribing patterns to improve patient clinical outcomes.

It most commonly occurs in tumors originating within the abdominopelvic cavity. Novel local control treatment strategies have been applied but prognosis remains poor with relapse rates of 70%. We have previously demonstrated the use of cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) to treat select pediatric patients. Here, we present results from our pediatric CRS-HIPEC program and examine outcomes in patients with disseminated peritoneal disease treated with CRS-HIPEC.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed a retrospective study of children undergoing CRS-HIPEC for peritoneal disease at a tertiary referral center from July 2018 to June 2020. Primary outcomes were relapse free survival and overall survival (OS). Median OS was compared to OS in adult sarcoma patients with peritoneal metastases identified within the National Cancer Database (NCDB).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 21 patients (1 to 21 years) diagnosed with various sarcomas, as well as gastrointestinal and gynecological malignancies originating from the abdomen, retroperitoneum or pelvis were included. The most common malignancies were desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCT) (43%), rhabdomyosarcomas (14%) and ovarian granulosa cell tumors (10%). Complete cytoreduction of gross disease was achieved in 81% of patients. Systemic chemotherapy was administered to 91% of patients, and 48% of patients received radiation before and/or after surgery. Complications were most commonly wound infections (25%), including one patient that required a wound vac, and urinary tract infections (19%) with one patient requiring ureteral stent placement for hydroureteronephrosis. The median follow-up period was 3.2 (2.0 - 7.1) months, during which 29% of patients had recurrence of disease. Of these, 33% had DSRCT. Median time to relapse was 3.3 (2.0 - 5.9) months after surgery. Recurrence was usually isolated to an extra-abdominal location (50%), although 33% of cases had an isolated intra-abdominal location and 17% had a combined intra and extra-abdominal component. There were no fatalities during the follow up period. In contrast, NCDB results showed that 16% (n=101) of adults with peritoneal metastases from abdominopelvic sarcomas died within 90 days of definitive surgery. None of these patients were treated with CRS-HIPEC and only 41% received any form of chemotherapy.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;In this case series, we demonstrate that CRS-HIPEC is associated with improved overall survival in pediatric patients with peritoneal metastatic disease. Further analysis with a larger patient population is necessary to determine which disease characteristics are most responsive to this aggressive treatment approach.

For families who desire elective circumcisions for their sons, health benefits are greatest and procedural risk is lowest when performed in the neonatal period. However, a significant proportion of boys present to surgical specialists later in childhood for elective operative circumcision. This study aims to assess physician perspectives on access to neonatal circumcision at hospitals across the United States and to identify potential reasons contributing to disparities in access.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A cross-sectional survey about neonatal circumcision availability and practices was electronically distributed to physician members of the Societies for Pediatric Urology and American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Hospital Medicine. Hospital characteristics (teaching status, public vs. private, region) and circumcision practices (availability, specialties performing circumcision) were assessed. Associations between neonatal circumcision&nbsp; availability and hospital characteristics were evaluated by chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression. Qualitative analyses of free-text survey comments were performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 367 physicians responded (129 urologists [41%], 188 pediatric hospitalists [59%]). 86% (317/367) of respondents reported neonatal circumcision availability at their institution. Hospitals offering neonatal circumcision had more availability on weekdays vs. weekends. Only 21% offered the procedure 24 hours per day. Many specialties performed circumcisions including Pediatrics (74%), Obstetrics/Gynecology (57%), Pediatric Urology (54%), Family Medicine (31%) and Pediatric Surgery (31%). On univariate and multivariate analysis, the 50 hospitals who did not offer neonatal circumcision were more likely to be located in the Western region (odds ratio [OR] = 8.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]=3.1-25 vs Midwest), and in an urban area (OR = 4.2; 95% CI=1.6-10 vs suburban/rural), compared with hospitals that offered the procedure. The most common reasons cited for lack of availability were: not a birth hospital (N=22, 47%), lack of insurance coverage (N=8, 17%), and low insurance reimbursement (N=7, 15%). Institutional, regional, or provider availability (N=71, 68%), insurance and payment (N=13, 12.4%), and ethics (N=13, 12.4%) were the most common themes in the qualitative comments (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Overall availability of neonatal circumcision varies based on hospital characteristics, including geography. Among hospitals who offer neonatal circumcision, temporal availability and specialty performing the procedure is also highly variable. This survey data will inform development of interventions designed to offer neonatal circumcisions equitably for families who desire the procedure for their newborn son.

This manifests as a high volume of calls to nursing staff as well as unanticipated clinic and emergency department (ED) visits. In order to mitigate unnecessary healthcare utilization, visual atlases have been developed to better prepare caregivers for the recovery process. The use of such atlases has previously been studied, yielding mixed results. Utilizing an increased sample size and extended study period, we hypothesize the implementation of a visual atlas will decrease parental anxiety in the postoperative period, resulting in reduced overall resource utilization.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A photographic atlas demonstrating circumcision healing was used in postoperative consultation and given to caregivers for patients undergoing circumcision or circumcision revision from November 2019 to May 2020. &nbsp;Data regarding patient demographics, postoperative telephone calls, and unanticipated presentations to clinic or the ED were collected prospectively and compared to a retrospective (no-atlas) cohort that did not receive the atlas between November 2018 and May 2019.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The no-atlas cohort included 105 patients, and the atlas cohort included 80 patients. Both groups were similar with respect to age (p=0.56) and type of procedure (p=0.88). There was no statistically significant difference between the no-atlas vs. atlas cohort with respect to phone calls to clinic staff (15 [11.8%] vs. 11 [13.8%], p=0.68). Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference between cohorts with respect to unanticipated postoperative encounters (3 [2.4%] vs. 4 [5.0%], p=0.43).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The utilization of a photographic atlas as part of caregiver support for circumcision patients did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in either postoperative phone calls or unanticipated postoperative presentations. Clinically, there was a reduction in the absolute number of caregiver phone calls (15 to 11), albeit an increase in follow-up presentations (3 to 4). The lack of significant change in postoperative phone calls and encounters may be due to the already infrequent occurrence of these events following circumcision, as demonstrated by the no-atlas cohort. Adding to current studies that have yielded mixed results, our study evaluates the largest patient population to date. Although our results suggest that a different educational approach may be needed to reduce postoperative phone calls and encounters as a measure of parental concern, further studies are required to determine whether or not a photographic atlas is a valuable educational tool for caregivers following pediatric circumcision.

Masand<sup>1</sup>, S. Vasudevan<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Pediatric liver cancers, including hepatoblastoma (HB), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver (UESL), and metastases are treated with a combination of systemic chemotherapy and complete R0 surgical resection.&nbsp; Accurate preoperative imaging including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary to define tumor relationships with major vascular and biliary structures.&nbsp; Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) is an established intraoperative tool for adult hepatic resections with limited use in children. &nbsp;Having previously reviewed our experience with IOUS in pediatric liver resection showing a discordance of 21%, we sought to update our experience.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We identified all children (&lt;18 years old) with malignant liver tumors or hepatic metastatic disease who underwent hepatic resection at our institution between January 2016 and December 2019.&nbsp; All patients underwent preoperative imaging either with computed tomography (CT) or MRI and results were compared to IOUS findings.&nbsp; Operative reports and images of all patients were examined to determine disparity between preoperative imaging and IOUS findings.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;31 patients were identified in total. These patients included twenty-four (77%) HB, two (6.5%) HCC, three (9%) UESL cases, and two hepatic metastatic Wilms tumor cases (6.5%).&nbsp; The median age across all patients was 58.9 months. Of cases performed, there were six (19%) non-anatomical hepatectomies, fourteen (44%) standard hemi-hepatectomies, and twelve (39%) extended hepatectomies.&nbsp; The median time between preoperative imaging and IOUS was 10 days (IQR: 5.25-23.5). Of the 31 patients evaluated with IOUS, five (16%) had discordant preoperative and IOUS imaging and six (19%) had an altered surgical plan due to IOUS findings. In one case, the MRI showed the presence of infectious nodules; however, these nodules were not seen on IOUS and a less extensive resection was performed. &nbsp;In an additional case, the tumor was thought to abut the middle hepatic vein (MHV), however, IOUS revealed a 2cm margin from the tumor to the MHV and this structure was preserved.&nbsp; In three cases, IOUS led to a more extensive resection due to the presence of disease outside of the involved segments identified in preoperative imaging.&nbsp; In a final case, the preoperative imaging showed a segment 6/7 lesion with equivocal encroachment onto segments 5/8. The surgeon confirmed involvement of segments 5/8 with IOUS necessitating a formal right hemi-hepatectomy.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;IOUS provides further delineation of tumor relationships to vascular structures that still has a significant discordance with preoperative imaging. Our study shows that in approximately 20% of cases, the surgical plan was altered with IOUS. We attribute the decrease in discordance to center experience and better MR imaging quality.&nbsp; However, the standard use of IOUS should be highly considered for the surgical management of pediatric hepatic malignancies.&nbsp;

Infant patients (&lt;1-year-old) with high risk for feeding difficulties represent a substantial portion of pediatric patients undergoing gastrostomy tube placement. However, the length of gastrostomy tubes remaining in place and predictors of the ability to wean from gastrostomy tube use are not well-established. The aim of this study is to identify patient demographic and clinical factors associated with persistent gastrostomy tube utilization at 6 and 12 months following GT placement in infancy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a single institution retrospective review of patients &le;1 year-old who underwent GT placement from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 using National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) database. The medical records of infants identified in NSQIP-P were examined for evidence of persistent GT use at 6- and 12-months. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients were reported. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with persistent GT use at 6 and 12-months after GT placement. Clincial and demographic predictors were selected a priori based on expert opinion, and included; corrected gestational age at surgery, sex, birth weight, American Society of Anesthesiology classification, NSQIP-P reported race, weight loss &ge;10% (failure to thrive) prior to placement, percent of goal feeds taken orally at the time of placement, and length of stay as a surrogate for clinical complexity (p-value&lt;0.05 used to detect significant association).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 140 infants &le;1 year old identified in NSQIP-P during the study period who underwent gastrostomy tube placement. At 6-months and 1-year after surgery, 17 (12.1%) and 38 (27.1%) of patients were no longer using their GT. Eighty patients (57.1%) continued using their gastrostomy tube at 1 year, and 22 patients (15.7%) were lost to follow-up. Of the examined variables, only weight loss &gt;10% prior to placement was associated with persistent GT use at 1 year (OR: 3.15 CI: 1.20, 8.25).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: &nbsp;GT placement is a common procedure in infants, especially in medically complex children. The odds of persistent GT use at 1 year increased with evidence of failure to thrive prior to surgery and suggests a period of time&nbsp;confirm the diagnosis of failure to thrive prior to GT placement may be associated with decreased GT utilization

We sought to determine the differential cost of appendectomy based on general or pediatric surgeons.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective review of the North Carolina Hospital Discharge Database (2013&ndash;2017) was performed in pediatric patients (&le;18 years) who had surgery for appendiceal pathology (acute or chronic appendicitis, other appendiceal pathology). Bivariate analysis over the type of surgical provider (GS, PS, other specialty, and unassigned surgeons) was performed. Surgical costs were compared by provider type.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Over the study period, 21,049 patients had appendicitis or other diseases of the appendix, and 6,790 (32.3%) had operations for appendiceal disease. Patients who were operated on by pediatric surgeons were younger (10 years (IQR 6-13) vs. 13 years (9 &ndash; 16 years), p&lt;0.001). Acute appendicitis was diagnosed in 2,860 (44.3%) and 3,173 (49.2%) of the pediatric and general surgeon cohorts, p=0.008. Pediatric surgeons performed a higher percentage of laparoscopic (n=2,697, 89.4% vs. n=2,178, 65.5%) than open appendectomies (n=280, 9.3% vs. n=1,118, 33.6%) than general surgeons, p&lt;0.001. The overall hospital charges were $28,081 (IQR: $21,706 &ndash; $37,431) and $24,322 (IQR: $17,906 &ndash; $32,226) for pediatric and general surgeons, respectively (p&lt;0.001). Surgical charges where higher for pediatric than general surgeons, $12,566 (IQR: $9,802 &ndash; 17,462) and $8,051 (IQR: $5,872 &ndash; 2,331), respectively. When controlling for diagnosis, surgical type, emergent status, age, and surgical cost of appendiceal surgery, pediatric surgeons were $4,280 higher than general surgeons (95% CI: 3,874 &ndash; 4,687).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The cost differential between pediatric and general surgeons following operations for appendiceal disease is significant. The specific reasons for this difference are not clearly delineated in this data set and persist after controlling for relevant covariates. Time in the operating room is the most expensive cost unit in healthcare. The higher rates of laparoscopic surgery in pediatric surgery patients may be associated with longer operating room times.

We hypothesized that clinical and imaging factors could be used to build a model to predict the need for abdominal surgery in children with BAT. We aimed to validate a predictive model designed for this purpose.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients under 18 years old from our institution&rsquo;s pediatric trauma database who experienced BAT between 2011 to 2019 was performed. Patients with an abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan without free intraperitoneal air were included. Subjects were required to have at least one of the following inclusion criteria: abdominal wall bruising, abdominal pain/tenderness, thoracolumbar fracture, presence of free fluid, and presence of solid organ injury. Pelvic fracture was also included in the current study. Statistical analyses were performed with Fisher&rsquo;s exact test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Two hundred nineteen patients met all inclusion criteria; 26 (12%) underwent abdominal exploration. The need for surgical management was significantly associated with the presence of free fluid (p&nbsp;= 0.002) and thoracolumbar fracture (p&nbsp;= 0.001). Abdominal wall bruising, abdominal pain/tenderness, solid organ injury, and pelvic fracture were not significantly associated with the need for surgery. Patients with BAT due to motor vehicle collision were isolated as a subgroup; 12 of 63 (19%) underwent abdominal exploration. Within this group, surgical intervention was significantly associated with free fluid (p =&nbsp;0.001) and thoracolumbar fracture (p&nbsp;= 0.011). A predictive model incorporating the 6 predictive factors had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The presence of free abdominal fluid on CT and thoracolumbar fracture may be predictive factors in determining the need for abdominal exploration in cases of BAT when there is no clear imaging indication for surgery. Further studies adding patients from other institutions&rsquo; databases are needed to determine which variables are important in validating a model to predict the need for abdominal exploration after BAT.

","G. Frid<sup>1</sup>, M. Reppucci<sup>1</sup>, M. Paul<sup>1</sup>, O. Onuh<sup>1</sup>, B. Coakley<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Mount Sinai School Of Medicine,Surgery,New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious illness that occurs among two specific populations: preterm infants and term infants with congenital heart disease (CHD). Prior studies have suggested these may be the manifestation of two separate disease entities. We sought to evaluate if there are differences in disease characteristics between these two populations.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective chart review of all infants treated for NEC at our institution from 2011-2020 was performed. Demographic data, birth-related factors, information regarding CHD, clinical diagnosis data, treatment outcomes and complications were recorded. Patients with CHD who were born preterm and less than 1.5 kg were excluded. CHD patients whose sole manifestation was the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus were also excluded. Statistical analysis was performed using a student&rsquo;s t-test for continuous variables and a &chi;2&nbsp;test for categorical variables.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;

The charts of 107 patients treated for NEC were reviewed. Nineteen infants were found to have CHD. There was a wide array of congenital cardiac anomalies among these 19 patients, including valvular atresia (6), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (3), coarctation of the aorta (2), ventricular septal defects (2), total anomalous pulmonary venous return (1), patent truncus arteriosus (1), AV canal (1), transposition of the great vessels (1) and combined anomalies (2). These 19 patients were subsequently compared to 57 randomly selected preterm NEC infants (1:3 ratio) from the same time period. There was no difference in postnatal age at diagnosis (p=0.50), but, unsurprisingly, infants in the CHD group were statistically older at the time of diagnosis (42.39 weeks for CHD infants vs 31.13 weeks for preterm infants, p&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences between intervention for disease (p=0.18), Bell&rsquo;s staging criteria (.19), CRP level at diagnosis (P=0.81), incidence of recurrent NEC (p=0.67) or death within 90 days (p=.51) between the two groups. Laparotomy was performed for four (21.1%) of the CHD infants and 10 (17.5%) of the preterm infants. All four CHD infants who required surgery had colonic disease involvement, whereas only 50% of the preterm infants undergoing surgery had colonic disease.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;

Disease severity, time to diagnosis, and treatment outcomes were similar in both groups of patients. However, NEC was more likely to involve the colon among CHD patients than for their premature counterparts. This anatomical discrepancy may point towards a different disease pathophysiology affecting CHD infants who develop NEC as compared to premature infants.&nbsp;

Pectus excavatum is estimated to occur in 1 in 300-400 live births. Complications resulting from an uncorrected defect are caused by increased pressure on the heart and lungs and may include: exercise intolerance, fatigue,&nbsp;heart arrhythmias and failure, respiratory infections, and body dysmorphia. The surgical correction of pectus excavatum by the Nuss procedure often results in significant postoperative pain. Pain management for these patients necessitates a&nbsp;multimodal approach&nbsp;often including opioids, NSAIDs, epidural or local anesthetic&nbsp;blocks, as well as mixed receptor medications such as ketamine and dexmedetomidine. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether the use of intraoperative methadone in addition to multimodal analgesia would reduce the postoperative opioid requirement&nbsp;for Nuss patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single-center, retrospective chart review was conducted for 31 patients who underwent the Nuss procedure between 2018 and 2020. Patients were placed in two groups; those who received multimodal anesthesia (MM, n=20) and those who received multimodal anesthesia with the addition of intraoperative methadone (MM+M, n=11). Data collected included demographic characteristics,&nbsp;total opioid consumption during admission (as morphine milligram equivalents (MME)), hospital length of stay (LOS), pain scores, and time to ambulation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The addition of intraoperative methadone to the multimodal anesthesia regimen of Nuss patients significantly reduced&nbsp;the total MME required during the hospital LOS (p=0.002). On average, the MM group received 59.60 MME per day (SD=38.83) while &nbsp;the MM+M group received 19.69 MME per day (SD=27.90). When compared to the MM group (M=3.91, SD=1.04), the MM+M group (M=3.50, SD=0.76) had a non-significant decrease in average hospital LOS.&nbsp;There was no significant difference in average pain score (p=0.253), time to toleration of solid food (p=0.365), nor time to ambulation (p=0.162). The patients did not differ significantly in age (p=0.418) nor BMI (p=0.482). No adverse events encountered in either cohort were statistically significantly different.&nbsp;The MM+M group experienced respiratory depression in 25% of patients compared to 36% of patients in the MM group. This difference was not, however, significant (p=0.683).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Incorporating methadone into the intraoperative multimodal pain management of Nuss patients is associated with a significant decrease in total opioid MMEs required postoperatively without a significant change in average pain score nor hospital LOS. There was not a significant difference in either cohort with respect to complications to include postoperative nausea/vomiting or respiratory depression.&nbsp; Adequate pain management prevents many grave postoperative complications to include pneumonia, oversedation or narcosis, falls, gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, venous thromboembolism, and other hospital-acquired infections acquired during a prolonged admission.

Gaines<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,Pediatric Surgery/Surgery,Dallas, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Subcutaneous abscesses occur frequently in the pediatric population, yet there is great variability in the approach to diagnosis and management, partly due to conflicting recommendations in the current literature. The vast majority of children&rsquo;s hospitals do not have a standardized protocol for diagnosis and management of subcutaneous abscesses; this has led to inconsistencies in the work-up and treatment. We hypothesize that the current variability in diagnostic procedures and management leads to the use of imaging studies which often do not contribute to accurate diagnosis and treatment. We sought to review the diagnostic work-up and the management protocols for subcutaneous abscesses at a large tertiary pediatric hospital.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We conducted a retrospective chart review during 12 months period. Institutional IRB approval was obtained. We identified 201 encounters for patients &lt;18 years of age using the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for subcutaneous abscesses at hospital admissions. The data points collected included demographics, recurrence/prior abscess treatment, hospitalization, presence of multiple abscesses, constitutional signs and symptoms, laboratory data including CRP, WBC, antibiotic regimen, and imaging studies. Statistical analyses were performed via Pearson c2&nbsp;and McNemar&rsquo;s test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Our results showed that only 13.6% of wound cultures led to a change in the antibiotic regimen. Blood cultures were positive in only 2.1% of cases. There were no differences in the overall successful drainage of abscesses with or without the aid of ultrasound study (85.7% vs. 88.9% respectively). Patients presenting with fever were more likely to be admitted than those without fever. Packing vs. interloop drain placement of abscess cavity after incision &amp; drainage had no differences in clinical outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Our data indicate that many of the current diagnostic workup used for the evaluation and management of a subcutaneous abscess have little to no effect on clinical outcome. Findings from this study could lead to developing a standardized protocol, which would be more effective and cost-efficient without compromising the overall outcome in the management of pediatric subcutaneous abscesses.

Minimal data exists comparing the outcomes between patients who receive an intraoperatively placed chest drain (IOCD) and those that do not have drains (NoD) placed during repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernias.&nbsp; In this study we compare postoperative outcomes between patients who underwent congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair with and without intraoperative chest drain placement.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of infants (age &lt;28 days) who underwent congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair between 2004-2018 was completed. Demographic, operative, and post-operative outcomes were collected. We compared the number of chest tube days, number of ventilator days, days on narcotic pain medications, incidence of post-operative chylothorax, and pleural or patch infection between the two patient groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 53 patients who underwent congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair. There was no statistically significant difference in estimated gestational age, weight, gender, or age at operation between patients who received an IOCD (25) and those who did not (NoD =28).IOCD patients had both more days of drainage as well as more postoperative chest drainage procedures than NoD patients.&nbsp; Patients who received IOCD kept their index tubes for a median of 6 days, with an initial total of 111 chest drain days in the 25-patient cohort. Seven (28%) of these patients required a second chest tube placed for 101 additional chest drain days.&nbsp; In contrast, only four (14%) patients in the NoD group required some form of chest drainage in the postoperative period.&nbsp; These four patients kept their drains for median length of 4 days, with a total of 20 days of chest drain placement in this cohort. Patients who received IOCD were less likely to have prenatal diagnosis and prenatal surgical consultation and were more likely to have type A defects.&nbsp; These patients also did not receive preoperative steroids, did not require closure with a patch, nor did they require temporary abdominal closure. Patients with IOCD also had fewer ventilator days (10 days) and shorter course of narcotic utilization (24 days) compared to NoD patients (12 and 35 days).&nbsp; This difference was not statistically significant (p &lt;0.08). There was no difference between the incidence of postoperative infections or chylothorax between each group.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In our study population intraoperative chest tubes were associated with more chest drainage days and an increased incidence of second chest drainage procedures; however, they were also associated with shorter periods on the ventilator and&nbsp;shorter durations of narcotic pain medication administration.

Blunt chest trauma is associated with significant morbidity and proven alterations in pulmonary mechanics of the chest wall, which increases the risk of pulmonary complications and healthcare utilization and can lead to poor quality of life. However, long-term functional status for patients with blunt chest trauma is less well-known. Return to work (RTW) is a useful measure of rehabilitation outcomes and is a benchmark for functional recovery in trauma patients, but minimal data exist regarding RTW following traumatic injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Adult patients &ge; 18 years old who were admitted to a Level 1 trauma center following blunt chest trauma with 1) &ge; 3 rib fractures and 2) length of stay (LOS) &ge; 3 days from 2014-2016 were eligible for inclusion. An electronic survey assessing RTW was administered to patients after discharge. Patients were stratified as having delayed RTW (&gt; 3 months after discharge) or self-reported worse activities-of-daily-living (ADL) function after injury. Survey data was combined with clinical data from the trauma admission. Unadjusted logistic regression models, Wilcoxon/Kruskal Wallis tests, and &chi;<sup> 2</sup>&nbsp;tests were used to compare patient demographics, outcomes, and injury characteristics, where appropriate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 324 patients eligible, 79 (24.4%) completed the survey. Median time to RTW was 4.2 months (IQR 3.7,4.8). 15.4% of respondents had a change in employment status after trauma with 34 patients remaining employed compared to 45 patients prior to the trauma. Those patients with delayed RTW had higher odds of having a greater number of rib fractures than those with RTW &le; 3 months (median 10 vs 7; OR:1.24, 95% CI:1.04,1.48, p=0.02) as well as a longer LOS (median 13 vs 7 days; OR:1.15, 95% CI: 1.04,1.30, p=0.01). Patients with stable ADL after trauma returned to work earlier than those reporting worse ADL (median 2 vs. 3.5 months, p&lt;0.01). 23.6% of respondents took longer than 5 months to return to independent daily functioning, and 50% of respondents report limitations in daily activities due to physical health after discharge. Mechanism of injury, ISS, and need for tube thoracostomy were not associated with delayed RTW after trauma.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
&gt; 24% of patients who were employed prior to their injury were no longer employed after injury. The significant proportion of patients with poor physical health and functional status suggests ongoing burden of injury after discharge. Those patients with longer LOS and greater number of rib fractures may be at highest risk for delayed RTW after injury. Future studies should assess the impact of early clinical intervention on RTW and functional status following blunt chest trauma.&nbsp;

Sternal fractures (SF) are rare and occur in 2% of patients with blunt injuries to the chest. There is scarcity of data related to the analysis of SF in relation to different parts of the sternum. The goal of this study was to delineate characteristics and to compare outcomes in patients with a manubrium fracture (MF) versus sternal body fracture (SB).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This IRB approved retrospective cohort study included 389 adult patients with radiologically confirmed SF who were treated at two level I trauma centers from 2015 to 2020. Patients were divided and compared based on types of SF: MF (n=103) and SB (n=286). Analyzed variables included: age, mechanism of injury (MOI), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), SF displacement, concomitant fractures of ribs, clavicle and vertebrae, retrosternal hematoma, sternal surgical intervention rates, tracheostomy rates, ICU admissions, ICU length of stay (ICU LOS), hospital length of stay (HLOS), and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
MF fractures were observed in 26.5% of patients with SF. MF mean age was 62.1 and SB was 61.2, with geriatric patients constituting about half of both groups (~50%). Main MOI in both groups was a motor vehicle collision (82%). Patients in both groups had similar ISS (14.2 vs 13.3, p=0.4) and GCS (13.9 vs 13.8, p=0.8). MF and SB had comparable rates of displaced fractures (20.4% vs 29.4%, p=0.1) and retrosternal hematomas (28.2% vs 25.2%, p=0.6). Concomitant fractures were significantly more common in MF than in SB (77.7% vs 61.9%, p=0.004) [Fig. 1]. Incidence of concomitant rib fractures was significantly higher in MF patients (58.3% vs 39.2%, p=0.001), with MF having higher rates of first and/or second ribs fractured (33.0% vs 13.6%, p&lt;0.001). &nbsp;Concomitant fractures of clavicle (12.6% vs 9.1%), scapula (2.9% vs 3.5%), and vertebrae (44.7% vs 37.1%) were comparable in both groups, all p&gt;0.2. Rates of sternal plating (9.7% vs 11.2%), tracheostomy (8.7% vs 5.9%), ICU admissions (56.3% vs 54.5%), ICU LOS (8.2 vs 6.5 days), and HLOS (10.6 vs 9.7 days) were not statistically different between MF and SB, with all p&gt;0.2. Patients in both groups had similar mortality rates (6.8% vs 8.7%, p=0.5) with at least half of the patients discharged either to home or to home with service. Only 15 patients had dual fractures (MF+SB), which corresponded to 3.7% of all patients with SF, and were not analyzed in this study.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Manubrial fractures are observed in approximately a quarter of patients with sternal fractures. Manubrium fractures are accompanied more often by upper rib fractures. Due to the location of the subclavian vessels and brachial plexus, caution should be exercised in patients with a manubrium fracture.

Uncontrolled truncal hemorrhage remains the most common cause of potentially preventable death after injury, with many patients dying before hospital arrival. Earlier truncal hemorrhage control and blood product resuscitation at the scene or en route to the hospital may increase survivability in this patient population, and is therefore an attractive concept. Some systems have successfully implemented prehospital advanced resuscitation care (ARC) teams (staffed by doctors, paramedics, nurses, and/or certified registered nurse anesthetists) who provide these interventions to the specific patients who require them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Early identification of such patients is key, and is reliant on consistent rapid decision making and communication. The purpose of this simulation study was to explore the feasibility of early identification of patients who might benefit from ARC, in a typical U.S. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) setting.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted a prospective observational/simulation study at a level I trauma center and two associated Fire-Based EMS agencies over a 9-month period. The county the trauma center is located in has a population of 1.15 million, and is served by 43 EMS agencies and 15 911 call centers. The two participating EMS agencies were asked to identify actual patients who might benefit from the activation of a hypothetical trauma center-based ARC team. This decision was then communicated in real time to the study team, and the outcomes of these patients were recorded. Each EMS agency was served by separate 911 call centers and used dissimilar mechanisms to identify patients.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
63 patients were determined to require activation of the hypothetical team. The number of activations per months ranged from 2 to 15. There were no temporal trends. Simulated call-outs most commonly occurred in the evenings with the highest incidence of calls between 4pm to midnight. Of the 63 patients, 33 were transported to the trauma center. The most common presentation was with penetrating trauma. The median age was 27 years (IQR 24-45), 75% were male, and the median injury severity score was 11 (IQR 7-20). Based on patient injury patterns, treatment received, and outcomes, it was determined that 6 of 33 (18%) patients may have benefited from advanced prehospital intervention. On review, all six patients were deemed to have potentially benefitted from earlier transfusion; one may have been helped by a surgical airway; two by prehospital thoracotomy, and one by resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta. Three of the patients died en-route to or soon after arrival to the trauma center.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The prehospital identification of patients who might benefit from ARC is possible but does face some challenges. Identifying strategies to modify or adapt existing processes may allow better utilization of the existing infrastructure and should be a focus of future efforts.&nbsp;

Gelbard<sup>1</sup>, J. Jansen<sup>1</sup>, J. Kerby<sup>1</sup>, J. B. Holcomb<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Use of O- whole blood (WB) for hemorrhagic shock has become more common, but logistical limitations prevent widespread adoption. Ubiquitous use of O+ WB could ease shortages as 40% of the population are O+ versus 8% O-. In women of childbearing age, alloimmunization is a risk, but evidence suggests this may be smaller than previously thought. Given the risks and possible benefits of O+ WB use, we sought to characterize the level of concern regarding the risks of emergent O+ WB in a healthcare worker population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Surgical and nursing faculty and staff were electronically surveyed on the risks and benefits associated with massive transfusion and O+ WB in women of childbearing age. Answers were stratified by 5-point Likert scale then further grouped as likely to accept (likely or very likely) or refuse (unlikely or very unlikely) transfusion. Participants were compared by both gender and childbearing age [(15-50) vs (&gt;50)] as important cohorts for differentiation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Ninety surveys were initiated with a 92% (83/90) response rate. Participants were 54% male (45/83)) and 46% (38/83) female. Of the female respondents, 81.5% (31/38) were of childbearing age. Both males (95%, 39/41) and females (89%, 33/37) were equally likely to accept transfusion (p=0.33). There was no difference if the risk of fetal harm was quantified at 1% (p=0.73) or 0.1% (p=0.51). 92% (34/37) of women were not opposed to transfusion with O+ WB, even if there were risk of future harm. Women of childbearing and non-childbearing age were equally likely to accept transfusion with risk of future fetal harm (27/30 vs 6/7, p=1.0).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
More than 90% of women were amenable to use of O+ blood. Our single center study suggests that universal O+ WB for emergency transfusion is acceptable, increasing the available donor pool and the potential for greater distribution. National data is needed to confirm these findings.&nbsp;

Rib fractures are common in the trauma population. Marijuana (THC) use is associated with low bone density and high bone turnover, increasing the risk of fractures following trauma. The use of marijuana also poses a significant detrimental effect on the trauma population. The effect of marijuana use in rib fracture patients is unknown. Our study aims to investigate the associations between recreational marijuana&nbsp;use and outcomes in trauma patients with rib fractures.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a 2016-2017 retrospective analysis of the trauma quality improvement program (TQIP). All adult (age &gt;18) trauma&nbsp;patients with rib fractures were included. Patients were stratified into two groups: chronic marijuana user (THC) and non-marijuana users (No-THC). A 1:1 ratio propensity score matching was performed adjusting for demographics, vital parameters, mechanism of injury, injury severity score (ISS), body regions abbreviated injury score (AIS), solid organ injuries, number of rib fractures, comorbidities, and smoking history. Outcome measures were in-hospital complications, in-hospital length of stay (LOS), and mortality

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 145,416 rib fracture patients, 21,166 patients (THC: 10,583; No-THC: 10,583) were matched. The mean age was 38&plusmn;15 years, 78% were males, 91% of patients had a blunt mechanism of injury, 73% had multiple rib fractures, and the median injury severity score was 30 [22-36]. The overall rate of in-hospital complications was 16%, and mortality was 4.8%. THC is associated with increased respiratory complications (2.8% vs. 1.6%, P&lt;0.001) and unplanned intubation (2.3% vs. 1.7%, P&lt;0.001), but not ventilator-associated pneumonia (1.9% vs. 1.7%, P=0.469). Overall in-hospital complications were higher in THC (16.4% vs. 14.9%, P=0.002) as compared to No-THC. In-hospital length of stay was significantly higher in THC (4.9 [2.1-10.8] vs. 4.0 [1.7-8.7], P&lt;0.001). There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (4.6% vs. 5.0%, P=0.199).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
THC use increases the risk of in-hospital complications in trauma patients with rib fractures. Cannabis use negatively impacts patient outcomes. Early identification and screening of cannabis in trauma patients with rib fractures is warranted and may improve their outcomes.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is major public health concern with a rising incidence in the United States. It is estimated that subdural hematomas (SDH) occur in 10% of head-injury patients, and in 5% of trauma patients overall. It is important to evaluate whether insurance and/or other social determinants of health play a role in treatment and outcomes of traumatic subdural hematomas.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) 2012-2016 was conducted to identify associations between insurance status, treatment and outcomes for traumatic SDH in adults. To isolate patients with only subdural hematomas, anyone categorized as having a TBI with multiple types of intracranial bleeding were excluded from the study. Demographic characteristics such as age, gender, race, and region were evaluated. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, injury severity score, and presentation to a level one trauma center were considered. The primary variables of interest were surgical intervention or intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Secondary outcomes of interest were emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, ICU admission, ICU LOS, and mortality.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
After inclusion/exclusion criteria was applied, the sample size included 68,687 adult patients. Overall, self-pay patients with a single diagnosis of SDH were younger, predominately male (73.1%; p&lt;0.001), and more likely to be non-white compared to patients with public or private health insurance (62.4%; p&lt;0.001 compared to publicly insured and privately insured, respectively at 79.5% vs 78.9%). &nbsp;More specifically, black/African American SDH patients make up a large percentage of the self-pay category (15.5%; p&lt;0.001) compared to publicly and privately insured (7.5% and 8.0%, respectively). Over 50% of uninsured patients are from the southern US region. After adjusting for age, sex, ISS, GCS, alcohol intoxication, and trauma center level, publicly insured patients were 1.86 (p &lt;0.001) times more likely to undergo a craniotomy or craniectomy compared to self-pay patients. However, insurance status did not appear to impact whether a patient received ICP/EVD monitoring (OR 0.52; p= 0.118). There was no statistically significant difference in ED LOS, Hospital LOS, and ICU LOS.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Publicly insured patients have higher odds of undergoing surgical management for traumatic SDH&rsquo;s compared to self-pay patients. Further studies evaluating this association are warranted.

Controlled substance use, particularly among the rising elderly population, places these patients at a much higher risk of falls, injuries, and hospitalization. This study examines the association between pre-injury controlled substance use and clinical outcomes of older adults after a ground level fall.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This is a single center retrospective review of registry data at a rural level 1 trauma center. We included all patients with ground level falls 60 years and older during a seven-year period from January 2011 to December 2017. Patients home medication list was analyzed to record any active controlled substances according to the Drug Enforcement Agency. Age, gender, controlled substance, total hospital days, total intensive care unit days, vent days, discharge status, discharge destination, and injury severity score were observed. Comparisons were analyzed using T-tests, Anova, Chi square, and logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
5930 patients were included. Almost half of the patients were taking controlled substances (45%), 67% of those were females. Total hospital days, Injury severity score and mortality outcome were not significant between groups. Intensive care unit days (ICU), days on mechanical ventilation, and discharge destination were found to be significant for patients taking controlled substances versus those not taking controlled substances. The mean length stay in the ICU was 0.5 versus 0.38 (P= 0.01). The mean length of vent days was 0.23 versus 0.12 (P= 0.01). These patients were also more likely to be discharged to short or long term care facilities versus patients not taking controlled substances (X2 (1, N= 5692,) = 12.61 P= 0.0003).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In our study patients 60 years and older taking controlled substances pre-injury experienced increased ICU stay, vent days and were more likely to be discharged to a facility when compared to those not taking controlled substances.

Victims of violence face lasting mental health impacts following their physical injury. Additionally, many are exposed to violent reinjury. Women who have experienced a violent injury have been shown to be at higher risk for developing mental health conditions after trauma and are frequently trapped in cycles of interpersonal violence. To address this, our institution established a novel Community Violence Response Team (CVRT) in 2011, imbedded within the trauma surgery division, to provide mental health services to victims of violence. This study aims to describe the implementation of CVRT within its first 5 years specifically among female victims of violence-related penetrating trauma and determine its efficacy in decreasing violent reinjury in this population.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Retrospective review of all female patients presenting to our urban level-one trauma center for violence-related injury from 2011 - 2015 (N=383). Sub-analysis included only those patients presenting after penetrating trauma (N=148). Demographic, index trauma, and CVRT service data were gathered from departmental databases. Hospitalization and reinjury details were retrieved from electronic health records. The relationship between receiving CVRT services and violent injury readmission within one year was evaluated with univariable and multivariable logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
CVRT saw approximately 75% of known eligible female patients by year five of implementation. For our specific population of interest there was a significant negative association between receiving CVRT and violent reinjury readmission at one year [&beta;=-0.77(SE 0.38) p=0.0403], with an approximate 80% decrease in the odds of violent reinjury as the cause for readmission within 1 year [OR 0.21, (95% CI 0.05,0.93)]. When adjusted for confounders including age and pre-existing mental illness, there remained a negative association, though it no longer reached statistical significance [b=-1.67(SE=0.87), OR=0.19(95% CI 0.03,1.04) p=0.0555].

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Preliminary analysis demonstrates that female CVRT recipients with index violence-related penetrating trauma were less likely to be readmitted for violent reinjury at one year. Provision of long-term mental health care appears to have a positive impact on trauma-related outcomes, though further evaluation of CVRT over subsequent years is necessary.&nbsp;

We investigated the impact of&nbsp;an updated&nbsp;multimodal analgesia&nbsp;protocol on&nbsp;inpatient and outpatient opioid usage for acute pain management in trauma.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective study was conducted of patients admitted to the trauma surgery service at an academic, Level 1 trauma center&nbsp;between September 2017-February 2018 (prior to&nbsp;the updated multimodal analgesia protocol; &ldquo;early&quot; cohort) and October 2018-April 2019 (after the updated multimodal analgesia protocol; &ldquo;late&quot; cohort). Cohorts were separated by 6 months to mitigate the influence of the summer season and&nbsp;allow for protocol&nbsp;establishment. Patients who required intubation were excluded. Charts were queried for demographic data, length of stay, injury severity score (ISS), and&nbsp;analgesic doses administered during hospitalization. An outpatient controlled substance registry was utilized to capture opioid oral&nbsp;morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and gabapentin prescriptions&nbsp;dispensed to patients in the 6 months after injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of&nbsp;620 patients were eligible for&nbsp;inclusion (295&nbsp;early,&nbsp;325&nbsp;late). No significant differences were appreciated in demographic factors including race, age, and gender; however, the late cohort had a median ISS of 13 (interquartile range [IQR] 9-17) compared to the earlier cohort ISS of 10 (9-17)&nbsp;(p=0.048). Intravenous hydromorphone usage decreased from 2mg (0-7mg) in the early cohort to 1mg (0-5mg) in the late cohort (p=0.02). Similarly, oxycodone usage decreased from 45mg (10-110mg) to 30mg (0-80mg) (p=0.01). Concurrently, gabapentin usage increased from 0 mg (0-0mg) in the early cohort to 400mg (0-1700mg) in the late cohort (p&lt;0.01). Use of other non-opioid adjuncts, such as acetaminophen and methocarbamol also increased. Patients in the late cohort were prescribed statistically fewer MMEs than the early cohort at discharge (p&lt;0.05). However, incidence of gabapentin prescribing increased significantly from 6.1% of patients in the early cohort to 16% of patients in the late cohort (p&lt;0.01). No differences&nbsp;were noted between cohorts&nbsp;in opioid&nbsp;or gabapentin use at&nbsp;6 months.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Implementation of an updated multimodal analgesia protocol decreased hydromorphone and oxycodone use while increasing gabapentin usage both inpatient and outpatient. This suggests that while reducing opioid usage in-hospital is critical to reducing outpatient usage, multimodal pain protocols may also lead to a substantial increase in gabapentin prescriptions and continued utilization after discharge.

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the association of a positive alcohol screen and outcomes in adolescent patients with TBI. We hypothesize that adolescent TBI patients with a positive alcohol screen on admission have improved mortality compared to those with a negative alcohol screen similarly to adults.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (year 2017) was queried for patients aged 13-17 presenting with a TBI (ICB-10 diagnosis) and a documented serum alcohol screen. Patients with missing information regarding the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission and presence/absence of midline shift on imaging were excluded. A multivariable logistic regression analysis for mortality was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;From 2,553 adolescent TBI patients with an alcohol screen, 220 (8.6%) were positive for serum alcohol. Patients with positive alcohol had&nbsp;a similar injury severity score to patients with negative alcohol (median 17 vs. 17, p=0.33).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective chart review of patients hospitalized for trauma, GI bleeding and burns at an urban level 1 Trauma Center (May 2018-May 2020) with the above criteria was conducted. A predictive model was created using machine learning (ML) with the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality, and secondary endpoints of hours survival post transfusion, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS and mechanical ventilation days. Variables included injury severity score, Glasgow coma score, number of operations, total blood products, shock index, time in ED, mechanism of injury and if the patient was given TXA, FACTOR VII, DDAVP, PCC, or other procoagulants. P-value &lt; 0.05 and R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.6 was considered significant. An interactive user interface of the model was then created to input individual data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
One hundred and four patients were included, the majority being male (n=79, 76%), black (n=72, 72%) and traumatically injured (n=96, 96%) with a median age of 32 [IQR 25-75]. Median total units of blood products transfused = 66 [IQR 50.5-118.5]. No single variable independently predicted the study outcomes. Using ML, a 12-variable model for all-cause mortality resulted in a logistic regression accuracy score of 0.714-0.857. When modeling hours survived, hospital LOS, ICU LOS, and mechanical ventilation days, R<sup>2 </sup>values were 0.36, 0.36, 0.24 and 0.27. Overall mortality was 49% (n=51) with the majority of patients dying within 3 hours (Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Number of transfused blood products alone does not predict mortality.&nbsp; Rather, this 12-variable mortality risk calculator allows better prediction of survival, particularly in individuals who survive beyond the first 3 hours of massive transfusion.&nbsp;

Early repeat imaging in the management of blunt hepatic injuries is used to identify potential delayed complications. Prior studies have suggested that routine follow up imaging is unnecessary, particularly in patients who are managed nonoperatively. Despite this, there is institutional variance in regards to the utilization and timing of repeat imaging in this patient population. This study examines the rate of delayed complications (pseudoaneurysm, increased hemoperitoneum, injury progression, bile leak/biloma, abscess, vascular thrombosis, fulminant liver failure, etc.) and subsequent intervention (operative or interventional radiologic) in patients with blunt hepatic injuries who undergo repeat imaging either due to a standard protocol or due to physician discretion.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A nine-year (2011-2019), retrospective, two-institution study was performed of adult patients (&ge;18 years) with blunt hepatic injuries. Patients were grouped based on whether repeat imaging was performed, and reason for reimaging: standard protocol (SP) or physician discretion (PD) based on clinical findings. The incidence of organ specific delayed complications and subsequent need for intervention was examined.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 365 blunt liver injuries included in the study, 122 (33.4%) underwent repeat imaging [computed tomography (CT), n=116 or ultrasound (US), n=6]. A total of 50 (41%) patients had repeat imaging due to SP and 72 (59%) due to PD. The mean time to repeat imaging was shorter in the SP group versus the PD group (4.7 &plusmn; 6.3 days vs 7.6 &plusmn; 8 days, p=0.034). Complications were found in 30 (25%) patients undergoing repeat imaging, [SP n=10, PD n=20; p=0.395]. &nbsp;Interventions were performed in 12 (40%) patients with identified complications on repeat imaging [SP n=2, PD n=10; p=0.120].

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our data demonstrates that repeat imaging due to a standard protocol occurred earlier in a patient&rsquo;s hospitalization than that performed due to physician discretion. One quarter of patients who were reimaged were found to have a delayed complication, with nearly half requiring intervention. Despite this, there was no difference in the incidence of clinically significant delayed complications or interventions between groups when compared by reason for scan. This suggests that it is safe to rely on physician discretion in prompting repeat imaging in blunt hepatic injuries. &nbsp;

Hu<sup>1,2</sup>, J. Lukan<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Erie County Medical Center,Surgery,Buffalo, NY, USA <sup>2</sup>State University Of New York At Buffalo,Medicine,Buffalo, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Although medical guidelines have forbidden the denial of trauma care based on payer status, research has shown that a patient&rsquo;s ability to pay can impact the entire supply chain of healthcare delivery. While the reasons for such disparities are multifactorial, the amortized cost of care, combined with lack of hospitalization reimbursement, presents with significant resource depletion and financial pressure to an institution, subsequently warranting alterations to current triaging practices. Our objective is to evaluate the impact of insurance status on injury burden, hospital resource utilization, and discharge disposition of trauma patients after a firearm-related injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was a retrospective analysis of a local level 1 trauma center registry consisting of 1450 patients with firearm injuries&nbsp;between 2009-2019.&nbsp;Outcome measures stratified by varying categories of insurance type were as follows: Demographics, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Length Of Stay (LOS), Discharge Disposition, Mortality, Reimbursement Ratio, Procedural Quanitity.&nbsp;Statistical tests used were ANOVA, correlation, logistic regression, chi-square, paired t-test (P&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Self-pay patients were younger (25.9 years), males (95.2%), black (81.2%), and more severely injured (ISS 17.9) when compared to Private (28.4 years, 60.7% male, 70.2% black, ISS 14.4) and Medicaid (27.1 years, 95.2% Male, 80.2% black, ISS 14.7) insured groups (P&lt;0.05). Self-pay patients had shorter hospital stays (4.6 days) relative to privately insured (8.52 days) and Medicaid patients (10.42 days), (P&lt;0.05). Differences were less pronounced when excluding those dead on arrival. Of those who survived to discharge, self-pay patients were least likely to be discharged with post-care service, followed by Medicaid and privately insured patients (P&lt;.001). Inflation-adjusted costs of initial inpatient hospitalizations were proportionally highest among Medicaid, followed by self-pay, and privately insured patients (P&lt;0.05). While private insurance made up 27.6% of the cases, it contributed over 50% of all reimbursement.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Payer status (and, by proxy, economic incentive) may explain disparities in the quantity/quality of care during inpatient and post-acute services. Future research must consider several points: Hospitals&rsquo; ability to obtain insurance coverage for those who die shortly after admission; Payer source definition and categorization; Procedural/Surgical intervention quantification versus quality; Longitudinal correlation of profitability inflection points and actuarial survival; Transitioning payment assessment/approval leading to discharge prioritization/delays.

Currently there is little known regarding the incidence and outcomes of traumatic&nbsp;penetrating injury in patients 55 and older, as this population is at higher risk of morbidity and mortality after trauma. The&nbsp;objective of this study is to quantify the volume of penetrating trauma in older patients over time and compare two cohorts 10 years apart to characterize and visualize the demographic correlates significant within this population. We hypothesize that the incidence of penetrating trauma has increased in the last 10 years and that African American patients more likely to sustain penetrating injury.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Trauma patients &ge; 55 years old were identified in the trauma registry of an urban, Level 1 trauma center from 2005 - 2017. Two cohorts were compared for trends, 2005 - 2007 (Cohort 1) and 2015 - 2017 (Cohort 2). Variables included: age, sex, ethnicity, ISS, LOS, ICU stay, mechanism of injury (MOI), intentionality, zip code, and mortality. Descriptive analyses were performed as well as multivariate logistic regressions. Maps for aggregated patient characteristics were created using ArcGIS with residency zip codes.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;289 patients met inclusion criteria from 2005-2017, with increase in volume over time.&nbsp;For our cohort analysis, Cohort 1 included 50 subjects and Cohort 2 included 103 subjects. Comparison between both cohorts demonstrated decreased mortality over this time period (28% vs 12.6%, p &nbsp;= 0.019). Gunshot wound (GSW) as MOI was significantly predominant in Cohort 1 whereas stab wound was more predominant in Cohort 2 (p = 0.024). For the entire population of patients, logistic regression analysis revealed that a greater likelihood of mortality is significantly associated with increasing age, GSW mechanism, suicide attempt, increasing ISS, and a longer ICU stay (p &lt;0.01). Heat maps demonstrated a clustering effect of African American ethnicity and stab wound as the MOI (Figure 1).
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The volume of older patients with&nbsp;penetrating trauma is increasing with a preponderance in African-American communities and a shift from GSW to stabbing as the MOI, which is associated with an improvement in mortality.

Velopulos<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver,GI, Trauma, And Endocrine Surgery,Aurora, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Physical violence is pervasive in&nbsp;United States&nbsp;prisons and jails and can lead to violent death. The goal&nbsp;of this project is to characterize trauma-associated deaths of the American incarcerated population. We also sought to determine what proportion of victims received emergent medical care prior to death,&nbsp;hypothesizing that fewer incarcerated victims would receive higher levels of care.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This is a report utilizing multi-state National Violent Death Reporting System&nbsp;data from the years 2015-2017, excluding states that did not collect data about hospitalizations following injury.&nbsp; Deaths that occurred to incarcerated victims were compared to those who were known to be non-incarcerated. Level of&nbsp;care that the victim received was characterized by if&nbsp;the patient was seen by emergency medical services (EMS), in the emergency room (ED), or hospitalized prior to death, with the latter considered&nbsp;higher levels of&nbsp;care. For both victims of suicide and of homicide, propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare the level of care received by incarcerated victims to non-incarcerated access with similar age, sex, race/ethnicity, weapon type, and state where the incident occurred.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 101,054 victims included in the analysis, with 1229 (1.2%) specified as incarcerated at the time of fatal injury. 64.4% of the included deaths were suicides, 23.1% were homicides, and 1.3% were due to legal interventions. Incarcerated homicide and suicide victims were more often male, and suicide victims were younger than the non-suicide population. For suicide, the proportion of minority victims was higher in the incarcerated population as compared to the non-incarcerated population, but the opposite was true of homicide victims. For the incarcerated population who died by suicide, hanging was the primary means, contrasted with 26.8% of non-incarcerated victims. Firearms were more commonly used in the non-incarcerated population for both suicide victims and homicide victims. After PSM, we found that incarcerated victims received higher levels of care after matching for suicide while there was no difference in level of care after matching for homicide &nbsp;(Table).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that incarcerated homicide victims received similar levels of care&nbsp;compared to non-incarcerated victims following lethal injury. Incarcerated suicide victims received higher levels of&nbsp;care. This examination shows that suicide deaths disproportionately victimize minorities during incarceration. Weapon types varied across groups with homicide weapons more varied, consistent with lack of firearm resources in the incarcerated setting. Our findings reinforce that violence prevention methods should be&nbsp;tailored to specific populations.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;141 patients comprised the matched cohort; 47 WB and 94 CT.&nbsp;&nbsp;Median age was 33 (IQR 25-49) years, mean RTS 5.8 (1.9), and 58.9% had penetrating injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no difference in ISS between groups (26 vs 26.5, p = 0.71).&nbsp;&nbsp;38 patients expired with a median time until death of 1 (IQR 1-5) days; 81.6% (31/38) died within 5 days of admission.&nbsp;Using 5-day mortality rates, recursive partitioning first split the cohort at an RTS of 4.3, then split the RTS &lt; 4.3 group at transfusion type. Mortality was significantly lower for patients who received WB compared to CT alone (25% vs 60%, p = 0.04).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Patients with lower RTS who received WB had a significantly lower 5-day mortality rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;The RTS may be a useful tool to determine who benefits most from WB transfusion during civilian trauma resuscitations.&nbsp;

Herein, we evaluated BCVI clinical significance by assessing BCVI incidence and outcomes in patients suffering LEMI and HEMI.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Medical records of adult patients admitted with cervical spine fractures between July 2015 and June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with single spinous process, osteophyte, and chronic fractures were excluded. Demographics, comorbidities, injury, screening and treatment-related data, iatrogenic complications, and mortality were collected. Univariate analysis was performed. P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Four hundred and eight patients were screened for BCVI, of which 54 were positive. Compared to HEMI cases (n = 325), LEMI cases (n = 83) were mostly female (65.1% vs. 31.7%, p &lt; 0.001), older (79.7&plusmn; 13.8 vs. 52.3 &plusmn; 19.9, p &lt;0.001), and already on anticoagulants (65.1% vs. 28.9%, p &lt; 0.001). More LEMI cases presented fractures at the C1-C3 level (79.5% vs. 53.8%, p &lt; 0.001). BCVI rates were similar (13.3% vs. 13.2%; p = 0.89). The vertebral artery was the affected vessel in all LEMI cases and in 90.7 % of the HEMI cases with no significant difference in BCVI grades. One HEMI case developed acute kidney injury because of BCVI screening. Four HEMI cases developed BCVI-related stroke with two related mortalities. No LEMI case developed stroke-related complications.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;BCVI rates were similar in both groups using our institutional screening protocol. Most LEMI cases were on anticoagulants prior to injury and none developed BCVI-related stroke, suggesting that pre-admission antithrombotic therapy may replace BCVI screening in that population. Future studies are warranted to test this hypothesis.

Recent shifts in state legislation have increased use of recreational and medical marijuana. While cannabinoids and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) have anti-inflammatory effects, whether pre-injury use of THC impacts severe TBI is unknown. We hypothesized pre-injury THC use in trauma patients suffering TBI would not improve patient outcomes.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) was used to identify patients aged &ge;18 years with severe TBI (Glasgow coma scale (GCS) &le; 8) in 2017. Patients with missing drug screen information or positive for drug and/or alcohol use besides THC were excluded. Demographic variables and injury patterns were examined using Chi Square analysis for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon-Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. &nbsp;Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine if THC use was associated with clinical outcomes.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 4,426 patients that met inclusion criteria, of which 774 (17%) were positive for THC only. Compared to patients with no drug or alcohol use, THC+ patients were younger (median age 27 years vs. 54, p &lt; 0.001) and more likely to be male (86% vs. 70%, p &lt; 0.001), uninsured (20% vs. 12%, p &lt; 0.001), nonwhite (38% vs. 26%, p &lt; 0.001), and victims of assault (15% vs. 5%, p &lt; 0.001) or firearm injury (19% vs. 7%, p &lt; 0.001). There was no difference in initial GCS (median 3, p = 0.214) between the groups, although THC+ patients had significantly longer intensive care lengths of stay (median 6 days vs. 5, p = 0.01), days on a ventilator (median 5 days vs. 4, p = 0.04), and hospital days (median 9 days vs. 7, p = 0.01). THC+ patients had significantly lower mortality rates (42.9% vs. 51.5%, p &lt; 0.001) and, although not statistically significant, fewer pulmonary embolisms (PE) (0.5% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.08), fewer strokes (1.2% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.05), and higher rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (7.5% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.06). On multivariate analysis controlled for age, injury severity, method of payment, gender, race, and THC use, being THC+ was not associated with mortality (odds ratio (OR): 0.95; 95% CI: 0.78 &ndash; 1.14, p=0.56), but was associated with decreased odds of PE (OR 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09 &ndash; 0.76, p = 0.02) and stroke/cerebrovascular accident (OR 0.44; 95% CI: 0.20 &ndash; 0.86, p = 0.03).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pre-injury THC use may be associated with decreased clot burden that leads to less PE and cerebrovascular accidents in patients with TBI. Further research in pathophysiological mechanisms related to THC use and TBI are needed.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp; Elective hospitalizations were selected from the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) with longitudinal evaluation. &nbsp;ICD-9/10 procedure and diagnosis codes were identified at index hospitalization. In-hospital mortality rates, length of stay (LOS), 30-day complications, readmission rates, and charges were evaluated.

Elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms may be performed through open or endovascular approaches, but the factors influencing repair-type preference are not well characterized. Here we performed a qualitative analysis of open-ended questions to better understand factors influencing patient preference within the Preference for Open Versus Endovascular Repair of AAA (PROVE-AAA) Trial.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
PROVE-AAA enrolled 236 veterans from 20 centers in the Veterans Administration system. 21 veterans (9%) provided open-ended responses on the main factor influencing their preference, and 47 veterans (20%) provided responses regarding other aspects of care that influenced their decision (i.e. secondary factors). Transcribed responses were independently coded by a team of three researchers. These codes were compared and used to define a set of mutually exclusive themes in an iterative process via discussion and consensus agreement. At the final step, themes were categorized into four groups: Short-Term Concerns, Long-Term Concerns, Advice &amp; Experience, and Other.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Eight themes were identified for the main factor influencing patient preference for type of aneurysm repair. Patients most frequently described Short-Term Concerns (23) as their primary influence, with themes including Post-op Complications, Hospitalization &amp; Recovery, and Intraoperative Concerns. A total of six patient responses were categorized as Long-Term Concerns (i.e. Survival), and only five responses indicated Advice &amp; Experience as a primary factor. Seven patients listed multiple concerns.

&nbsp;

Ten themes were identified as secondary factors influencing patient preference. The single most common theme was &ldquo;None&rdquo; (17). Responses categorized as Long-Term Concerns were more prevalent (20), which included codes such as Survival, Risk for Follow-up Interventions, and Durability of Repair, and Pre-existing Conditions. &nbsp;As compared to primary motivating factors, there were fewer responses categorized as Short-Term concerns (13) and more responses categorized as Advice or Experience (10). Of note, one of the most prevalent themes encountered was an overall Lack of Information (10), which included statements regarding a desire for more information.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This qualitative analysis suggests that short-term concerns relating to the procedure and recovery are more often the primary factor influencing patient preference, while long-term concerns play a more secondary role. Vascular surgeons should consider this information when discussing repair options with patients in order to reach an optimal shared decision.

If not identified early and addressed properly, it can lead to compartment syndrome (CS) and limb amputation. The aim of this study is to examine traumatic femoral artery injuries and identify risk factors for the development of lower extremity CS.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Adult (&ge;18 years) patients who presented with traumatic femoral artery injuries were identified in the Trauma Quality Improvement Program 2017. Patients were stratified into two groups, those with evidence of lower extremity compartment syndrome (CS) and those without CS (NCS), for comparison. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for the development of lower extremity CS.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 1,297 adult trauma patients with femoral artery injury were identified. Mean age was 36&plusmn;15 years, 86% were male, and 68% had penetrating injuries. Median extremity abbreviated injury scale (AIS) was 3 [3,4], and median injury severity score (ISS) was 27 [22-41]. A total of 68 (5.2%) patients were diagnosed with CS of the lower extremity, 66 (97.1%) of those patients underwent fasciotomy and one (1.5%) patient eventually had an amputation. On multivariate regression analysis, concomitant femoral vein, femoral nerve, and popliteal artery injuries and early need for blood transfusions were independent risk factors for the development of CS (aOR 3.1, 3.8, 4.3, and 2.5 respectively). (Table 1)


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;CS following traumatic femoral artery injury is a relatively uncommon finding. Concomitant popliteal arterial injury should raise the concern for CS. Physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion and should consider prophylactic fasciotomy in the setting of injury to the femoral sheath.

AIAs are recommended to have prophylactic repair in medically fit patients for prevention of rupture when meeting size threshold of concern. Additionally, prophylactic repair of aortoiliac aneurysms may be indicated at sizes lower than usual thresholds in cases of accelerated expansion rates. Patients exposed to toxic substances may represent an at-risk population for more rapidly progressing vascular pathologies and aneurysm growth. The goal of the project is to determine if patients subjected to prostate and bladder cancer treatment have accelerated growth of aortoiliac aneurysms and compare the growth rates of populations receiving different treatment modalities.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A retrospective chart review was conducted from a large, tertiary medical center consisting of a cohort of 284 patients who were identified as having a bladder or prostate biopsy in the years 2015-2019. Following exclusion of 120 patients with only a single computed tomography (CT) imaging scan, we identified 164 patients who received treatment for bladder (47) or prostate (117) cancer with 2 or more CT scans. CT images were analyzed for maximal infrarenal aortic segment and right and left iliac segment diameters prior to treatment and following treatment to determine growth rates. Cancer treatment regimens and demographics were recorded to differentiate between group and sub-group growth rates.

Median [IQR] imaging follow-up was 2.8 years [1.3-5.0] overall, 2.8 [1.6-5.6] in bladder cancer, and 2.8 [1.2-4.9] in prostate cancer. Interestingly, we did find high rates of baseline iliac ectasia (diameters in the 10-15 mm range) in 50% of the cohort (n=80) and iliac aneurysms (diameter&gt;15mm) in an additional 46% (n=74) of the cohort, but low rates of AAA in the cohort (n=5, 3%). Iliac aneurysms prior to malignancy treatment were more common in prostate cancer patients (56% vs 22%, p&lt;.001). Over the time studied, growth rates in infrarenal aorta (0.72 mm/year) or iliac segments (right common iliac artery (CIA), 0.55 mm/year; left CIA, 0.79 mm/year) did not exceed 1 mm/year. Patients undergoing treatment via combined radiation and chemotherapy trended toward a higher growth aortic rate of 1.92 mm/year (p=.66) than other malignancy therapies.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;We did not identify accelerated aortic or iliac degeneration in patients being treated for pelvic malignancy. Our results are limited by size of the cohort and shorter duration of follow-up available to date. However, we identified a potentially novel, at-risk population with higher rates of baseline ectasia and aneurysms which warrants further studies on aneurysm growth.

Duplex ultrasonography (DUS) is readily available and often used as the first diagnostic test for patients with PAD however because the examination is operator-dependent by nature it has obvious limitations. Ultrasound findings can often lead to performing unnecessary diagnostic angiograms. DUS is highly sensitive for evaluating femoral and popliteal segments however evaluation of the tribal vessels has not been well studied. Our aim was to correlate the accuracy of DUS compared to angiography of the infrapopliteal segments.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;

This was a retrospective study from August 2019 to January 2020 analyzing three segments (anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial and peroneal) in patients who received a duplex study followed by conventional angiogram within a 30-day period.

All visualized segments were graded as normal, severe disease or occluded based on color flow, degree of calcification and velocities on duplex and compared to percent stenosis or occlusion on angiograms. All studies were evaluated by an independent, RPVI accredited, vascular surgeon.

The data was described using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and means and standard deviations for quantitative variables.&nbsp;Comparisons between duplex ultrasound and angiography for each segment were made&nbsp;using Bowker&rsquo;s test for symmetry. All statistical tests were two-sided. P-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (Statistical Analysis Systems Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

57 patients were included in the study and a total of 171 infrapopliteal segments were analyzed, 23 were female while 24 were male, Mean age was 67 years. Comorbidities included, 47 patients (82%) with diabetes, 47 (82%) with hypertension, 24 (43%) were smokers and 21 (38%) had a history of coronary artery disease. All patients suffered from tissue loss. Segments which were not visualized by duplex were not included in the statistical analysis. Of the anterior tibial segments studied, 76% were read as normal on duplex while 25% were noted to be normal on angiogram. Of the posterior tibial (PT) segments, 74% were read as normal on duplex, while 19% were read as normal on angiogram. 84% of peroneal segments were read as normal on duplex and 21% were read as normal on angiograms.

&nbsp;The symmetry test was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) for all three segments (Anterior tibial, posterior tibial and Peroneal), thus indicating disagreement between DUS and conventional angiography (i.e. we reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two methods in identifying patients as normal, severe, and occluded).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Although widely used as a tool in assessing peripheral arterial disease, there are significant limitations of DUS especially when studying infrapopliteal disease. Significant disagreements were noted in this study between DUS and conventional angiogram where normal disease seen on duplex was noted to be severe or occluded on angiograms.&nbsp; This suggests that one must approach infrapopliteal duplex findings of peripheral arterial disease with caution. Clinical correlation with physical exam and history should always be taken into consideration to see if further tests are needed. Further studies, with larger patient population is warranted.

Goodney<sup>1</sup>, N. Zacharias<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center,Vascular Surgery,Lebanon, NEW HAMPSHIRE, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;In patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia lacking suitable autologous vein, cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts represent an alternative conduit for bypass grafting. The existing literature suggests that long term patency of such bypass grafts is limited, however their role in limb salvage remains uncertain. The purpose of this study was to examine patency and amputation-free survival of cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts used for infrainguinal revascularization. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We conducted a retrospective review of patients who had infrainguinal bypass with cryopreserved saphenous vein allograft conduit for critical limb ischemia from 2004 to 2019. The primary endpoints of the study were primary patency and amputation-free survival. Secondary endpoints included perioperative complications and technical cost. Primary patency and amputation-free survival were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;During the study period twenty five cryopreserved saphenous vein allograft bypasses were performed in 22 patients (12 male; median age 69.5). Indications for surgery included rest pain (60%) and/or tissue loss (88%). Fifteen patients had prior ipsilateral failed bypasses and no patients had adequate ipsilateral autologous saphenous vein available. Distal targets included above or below knee popliteal artery (40%) or tibial vessels (60%). The median follow up was 16 months (range 0-58 months). The median primary patency of cryopreserved allografts was 0.51 years. The median amputation-free survival was 1.2 years (Figure 1). When cryopreserved vein allografts were used for tissue loss, successful wound healing occurred in 50% (11/22) of cases. Perioperative complications included four early graft thromboses (16%), two major adverse cardiac events (8%), and one amputation (4%). The 30-day mortality rate was 0%. The mean total technical cost of these procedures was $51,438 &plusmn; 28,856. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The use of cryopreserved saphenous vein allograft conduit&nbsp;in patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia appears to provide reasonable limb salvage rates in patients without alternate conduit options. The poor patency rates and high technical cost, however, suggest that judicious use of these conduits when no superior alternative exists should be employed to ensure optimal patient benefit.

COVID-19 disrupted nearly every aspect of everyday life and shattered normalcy for most individuals. The postponement of non-emergent surgeries due to the pandemic, further perturbed normalcy and prevented restoration of day-to-day function for many individuals. This qualitative study attempts to understand how individuals who experienced surgical delay coped with living with severe cardiac or vascular disease and uncertainty of when surgery might be rescheduled.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Utilizing a phenomenological qualitative design, we interviewed 47 individuals who experienced a postponement of cardiac or vascular surgery due to the COVID-19 pandemic at a single institution. Data were analyzed iteratively and informed by phenomenological research methods.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Participants in our study discussed their cardiovascular surgeries as a medical event that would restore normalcy to their lives and &ldquo;cure&rdquo; their disease. Patients described the stress associated with living with severe cardiovascular disease and the consequences of untreated disease, such as &ldquo;[My aneurysm] is getting larger. It will burst. That stresses the hell out of me.&rdquo; Because surgery was postponed, most often with an indeterminate reschedule date, patients felt left alone to manage the stress and uncertainty of their disease in abnormal times without provider input. Patients attempted to manage their symptoms on their own because, &ldquo;those symptoms don&#39;t go away just because the surgery got postponed. Matter of fact, I even started paying attention to it even more. Then it gets scarier.&rdquo; One patient described it as &ldquo;kind of like living in a glass box with somebody outside of it that you can see has a rock in their hand. And there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it&hellip;&rdquo; Diversion and distraction from the seriousness of their condition was a strategy for coping with their condition. Patients turned to music and television, or as one patient commented, &ldquo;to get my mind off thinking of it, I just&hellip;I have Alexa.&rdquo; Finally, an overwhelming number of patients relied on higher deities, such as God or philosophies of life such as, &ldquo;it is what it is&rdquo; and &ldquo;Faith in Jesus is what keeps me going, keeps me from jumping off a tall building somewhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

Discussion:

The elimination of elective surgeries during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic may have latent consequences that extend beyond the physical health of those impacted by delays.&nbsp; These results underscore the importance of not only considering the traditional healthcare outcomes of surgical delay but also the significant psychological effects on those who have their procedures postponed in the setting of the pandemic.

However, little is known on the digital footprint of vascular surgeons and their interactivity with patients on social media. We aim to understand the activity of academic vascular surgeons on physician rating websites.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Information on attending vascular surgeons affiliated with vascular residencies or fellowships in the Southern Association for Vascular Surgery were collected. Websites containing physician ratings were obtained via literature review and google search. Open access websites that contain either qualitative or quantitative evaluation of vascular surgeons within the SAVS region were included. Ranking agencies and closed access websites were excluded. Ranking scores from each website were converted to standard 5-point scale for comparison. Data analysis was performed using R.




<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 6238 quantitative and 967 qualitative reviews were written for 287 physicians (236 males, 82%) across 16 websites that met inclusion criteria out of 62 websites screened. Surgeons in the SAVS region had a median of 8 (interquartile range: 7-10) profiles across 16 websites with only one surgeon having no web presence on any sites. The median number of quantitative ratings for each physician was 17 (interquartile range: 6-34, range: 1-137) and the median number of narrative reviews was 3 (interquartile range: 2-6, range: 1-28). Vitals&reg;, WebMD&reg; and Healthgrades&reg; were the only three websites where over a quarter of the physicians were rated, and those rated had more than 5 ratings on average. The median score for quantitative reviews was 4.4 (interquartile range: 4.0-4.9). Most narrative reviews (78.4%, 758/967) were positive, but 20.2% were considered negative; only 1.4% were considered equivocal. No statistical difference was found in the number of quantitative reviews or overall average score in physicians with versus without social media profiles. No physicians responded to patient rating or narrative reviews.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Vascular representation on physician rating websites is varied with the majority of vascular surgeons only represented on the top half of the physician rating websites. The number of quantitative and qualitative reviews are low. No surgeons responded to reviews. The activity of vascular surgeons in this area of social media is low and reflects a small digital footprint that patients can reach and review.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This is a retrospective chart review of patients admitted with the diagnosis of ATBAD over&nbsp;a period of 10 years (May 2010 to March 2020). All patients with the diagnosis of ATBAD are generally admitted to the vascular surgery service.&nbsp; Patients who presented with acute symptoms&nbsp;and had evidence of a type B aortic dissection on Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) were included in the study while patients who presented with acute type A aortic dissection, intramural hematoma or penetrating aortic ulcer were excluded.&nbsp; Initial management for all patients included beta blockade and vasodilation. Surgical intervention was performed for malperfusion, persistent pain with refractory hypertension, rupture, and progressing dissection on CT.&nbsp; Demographics, clinical presentation, radiologic findings, hospital course, length of stay and mortality were recorded for analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;There were 59 consecutive patients.&nbsp; The average age of the patients was 61 years and 70% were male.&nbsp; Eighty one percent of the patients had history of hypertension and they presented with an average systolic pressure of 183 mmHg. The most common presenting symptoms were back pain (76%) and chest pain (72.3%) while abdominal pain (52.5%) and extremity pain (13.6%) were less frequent. Twenty two percent of the patients presented with complications, visceral malperfusion (10)&nbsp;and rupture (3). These patients required emergency surgery.&nbsp;The remaining 46 patients were initially medically managed however&nbsp;21 of these patients subsequently required intervention within 30 days. Of these 21, 6 developed malperfusion after presentation, 12 had refractory pain and hypertension, 2 had progressive dissection changes on CTA, and one had concern for associated symptomatic aneurysm. During the first 30 days, 58% of all the patients underwent required surgery, primarily Thoracic Aortic Endograft in 26 patients. There were three deaths within the first 30 days, rupture in 1, retrograde dissection after stent graft in 1 and a third patient died the day of discharge probably due to rupture.&nbsp; The average length of stay was 10.6 days (range 1 to 43).&nbsp; Patients who required intervention averaged a length of stay of 13.2 days compared to patients without intervention averaging 6.4 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;ATBAD remains a serious condition. &nbsp; While the initial medical management is successful in many patients, over 50% ultimately required surgical intervention during the initial 30 days.

Popliteal artery injuries have the highest rate of extremity amputation for traumatic arterial injuries in adults,&nbsp;with a reported rate of approximately 21%. A review of the literature shows the rate of amputation in pediatric trauma patients who sustain lower extremity injuries is also highest for those with popliteal artery injury.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The aim of this study is to evaluate pediatric trauma patients who sustained popliteal artery injury. A retrospective review was performed from April 1, 2005 to October 31, 2019. Primary endpoints included associated injuries, injury severity score, operative intervention, fasciotomy rates, and amputation rates.&nbsp;



<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;A total of 10 pediatric trauma patients who sustained popliteal artery injury were identified. 80% of patients were male and the mean age was 14.1 years (rage 9-16). 70% of patients presented with blunt lower extremity injuries and 80% had associated orthopedic injuries in the ipsilateral limb. Mean injury severity score was 9.6 (range 9-13). Operative repair for popliteal artery injury was performed with either interposition synthetic grafts (30%) or&nbsp;vein grafts (50%). During initial surgical repair, 71% of patients with blunt injuries and 67% of patients with penetrating injuries underwent four-compartment fasciotomy.&nbsp;The rate of amputation was 30% for pediatric popliteal artery injury.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted a retrospective review of all trauma patients over 18 years of age who received REBOA on admission between 2016 to 2019 at two large Midwestern Level 1 Trauma Centers. Demographic data, injury mechanism, injury severity score (ISS), mortality, zone of balloon inflation, details of the procedure, level of the provider performing the procedure and complications were collected. Results are presented as percentages, median with interquartile range (IQR), or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).&nbsp; Factors associated with mortality were identified using logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 51 patients were identified for the study.&nbsp; The median age was 41 (31, 57) and 69% were male.&nbsp; Median ISS was 25 (20, 42) and 88% of the REBOA devices were placed for blunt trauma. The commercially available 7-French REBOA kit was used in all cases, with femoral access obtained percutaneously in 83% and with ultrasound in 27%. Attending surgeons placed 47% of the catheters, while the remainder were placed by the residents or advanced practice providers.&nbsp; The majority of the procedures were performed in the trauma bay (71%), while the others in the ICU or OR (29%).&nbsp; Overall mortality was 49%, with 53% mortality in blunt trauma and 17% in penetrating trauma.&nbsp; Patient&rsquo;s age had no effect on mortality outcome, nor did the zone of balloon inflation.&nbsp; ISS greater than 25 and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) prior to REBOA placement were associated with increased mortality (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.06-10.6, p = 0.04; OR 38, 95% CI 6.9-210, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively).

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sequela of trauma, often requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) traditionally managed by a nephrologist. Studies have described an inverse relationship between CRRT days and survival. This report describes a 10-year single institution experience with critical care surgeon controlled CRRT (SCCRRT).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Adult trauma patients undergoing SCCRRT from 2007-2018 were identified, excluding those previously on dialysis. Demographic, injury, and outcome data were compared between groups stratified by survival.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Forty-five patients underwent SCCRRT with a survival rate of 68.9%. Indications for CRRT included renal failure (55.6%), volume overload (13.9%), acidosis (11.1%), rhabdomyolysis (11.1%), and sepsis (8.9%). Age, gender, race, ISS, lactic acid level, vasopressor use, and operative intervention were similar between groups. Patients who survived had longer hospital length of stay (LOS) (38.1 vs. 18.5 days, p=0.004) and higher need for intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) (51.1 vs. 14.3%, p=0.009). On univariate logistic regression analysis, decreased admission creatinine (OR 0.28, 95%CI 0.08-0.98, p=0.05), increased hospital LOS (OR 1.08, 95%CI 1.02-1.14, p=0.01), and need for IHD (OR 8.31, 95%CI 1.58-43.62, p=0.01) were associated with increased odds of survival.

The frequency of antibody formation in patients that have undergone massive blood transfusions is unknown. Blood transfusions are considered first-line treatment for a number of conditions, however patients forming de-novo antibodies to antigenic stimuli during a transfusion is an unwanted by-product of the event. We sought to classify the magnitude of this phenomenon during massive transfusion protocols.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Our institutional database was queried to identify all patients from 5/1/2014 (beginning of current electronic health record implementation) that received massive transfusion protocol, and multiple myeloma patients that received crossmatched blood. Antibodies were detected using a direct Coomb&rsquo;s test on the patient&rsquo;s blood post-transfusion. Multiple myeloma patients were selected as control because this group is frequently transfused as part of regular therapy. Descriptive statistics were performed using (STATA, College Town, TX) and categorical variables were represented as a percentage and continuous variables were presented as mean +/- standard deviation.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 47 patients who received MTP, one patient developed antibodies at a rate (2.12%) significantly lower than the other two groups. The multiple myeloma patients had 36 antibody formers out of 593 (6.07%) and 4 multiple myeloma patients receiving massive transfusion formed antibodies out of 53 total&nbsp; (7.54%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

These results suggest that repeated exposure to blood products may be a stronger predisposing factor for autoantibody formation than amount transfused into the patient in a single setting. Further research could follow up to determine how patient stability is a determining factor in autoimmunity and how that can be applied to future emergency transfusion guidelines.

MAUNG<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine,Surgery,New Haven, CT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Anticoagulation (AC) has been associated with worse outcomes after trauma in some but not all studies. In a recent, small (64 patients on AC) study, AC had no effect on mortality or length of stay (LOS) in patients with spleen and/or liver injuries.&nbsp; To further investigate the effect of AC on outcomes in patients with splenic injury, we performed a study utilizing the Trauma Quality Programs Participant Use File (PUF)

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The 2017 PUF was used to identify adult (18+ years) with all mechanisms and grades of splenic injury. Demographics, comorbidities, hospital course and outcomes were compared between AC and non-AC patients (identified by the NTDS anticoagulant therapy co-morbid condition field which combines all anticoagulant agents). &nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 18749 patients with splenic injury were identified, 622 were on AC. &nbsp;The AC patients were older (68 vs. 42 years, p &lt; 0.001) but had comparable gender composition to non-AC patients. &nbsp;Injury Severity Score (18.2 vs 22.5) and rates of serious (AIS &ge; 3) &nbsp;injury Chest (43.1 vs 51.3%), Abdomen (50.5 vs 60.8%) and Extremity (11.1 vs 18.1%) were all lower in the AC group (p=0.001). Rates of serious (AIS &ge; 3) head injury were not statistically different between the two groups (14 .0 vs 17.4%, p=0.29)

Similar percentages in each group (26.5 vs 26.4%) were transfused packed red blood cells (RBC) within the first 4 hours thus meeting the NTDS criteria for collection of further hemorrhage control data. Within this hemorrhage control group, the AC patients received fewer units of RBC (5.7 vs 8.0 units, p &lt; 0.001) and FFP (3.9 vs 5.4 units, p &lt; 0.001) in the first 24 hours but underwent angiography at similar rates (23.6 vs 24.5%, p=0.8). &nbsp;Among those who underwent angiography, patients were however more likely to undergo embolization if they were on AC (89.7 vs 73.9%, p=0.04).

Within the whole splenic injury cohort, rates of splenic surgery were comparable between the two groups (19.3 vs 21.5%, p=0.2). Median LOS was longer in AC patients (6.3 vs 5.6 days, p=0.002). Despite being less seriously injured, the AC patients had a higher mortality (13.3 vs 7.0%, p = 0.001). In a multivariable binary logistic regression, AC was an independent risk factor for mortality with OR 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.9)

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a retrospective review of all UEPVI patients presenting to our Level I trauma center between 1986 and 2019. SPSS Statistical Software was used to perform bivariate statistics and multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses to determine the independent predictors of mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS) using the covariates race, age, gender, insurance status, ISS, mechanism of injury and ED disposition.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 481 total patients, the majority were male (87%) Caucasian (52%), uninsured/underinsured (52%).&nbsp; 58% of injuries were caused by assault or self-inflicted, most commonly gun-shot wounds (23%) or stab wounds (22%). 60% underwent surgery for their injuries. The most common vascular procedures were primary repair of the artery (31%) or distal arterial ligation (21%). On bivariate analysis, female patients had a higher injury severity score (ISS) (mean 9.55 compared to 6.77, p=0.02), were more likely to go to the operating room (40.6% compared to 24.2%, p=0.02), but had a lower mortality (1.6% compared to 4.8%, p=0.009) compared to male patients. On multivariate analysis, older age (R 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89-0.99, p=0.03) and higher ISS (OR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.72-0.87, p&lt;0.001) were both associated with increased risk-adjusted mortality. Lack of insurance/underinsurance (OR 5.17, 95% CI: 1.09-24.61, p=0.04) was also associated with increased mortality, though race was not (p=0.22).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our retrospective analysis demonstrated that the majority of penetrating upper extremity vascular injuries are incurred by men and are associated with assaultive or self-directed violence. On multivariate analysis, older age, higher ISS, and lack of insurance or underinsurance were associated with increased mortality. Future studies should investigate preventive strategies aimed at reducing UEPVI among at-risk individuals identified in this study.&nbsp;

The R01 grant is viewed as an indicator of research independence, while the K-series awards support early-stage investigators with protected time for mentor-based research experiences. The goals of this study were to 1) investigate the types of grants successfully awarded to pediatric surgeon-scientists and 2) determine the utility of the K-series award in achieving research independence.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  In July 2020, the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools was queried for grants awarded to all current candidate and regular members of the American Pediatric Surgery Association (APSA) between 2012 and 2020. Resident and senior APSA members, as well as Ph.D. members, were excluded. K-series grants included K08 and K23. Grants indicating independent funding included R01, R21, R34, U01, U54 P01 and P50. Factors analyzed included: gender, institution, type of grant,&nbsp;number of publications per grant, amount of funding, and K-to-R grant transitions. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed via SPSS, and significance was defined as p &lt; 0.05.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of the current 1051 APSA members, 63 (6.0%) held NIH grant&nbsp;awards, for a total of 79&nbsp;NIH grants awarded between 2012-2020, representing $96.8M in total funding. There were 13 K-series grants awarded in this interval, including 9 K08 grants and 4 K23 grants. During this time, 66 independent grants were awarded, with R01 grants comprising the majority (78.8%). Notably, there were an additional 10 renewals of grants awarded prior to 2012. To assess the transition rate of K-series awards to R awards, 18 K-series grants were analyzed, which included 12 K grants awarded between 2008 and 2011 which expired after 2012 and 6 K grants awarded between 2012 and 2015, which would have time to transition to an R award. Of these 18, 7 (38.9%) successfully transitioned to an independent grant. For these individuals, the mean time from the end of the K grant to the beginning of an R grant was 1.7&nbsp;years. On univariate analysis, there was a significant difference in number of publications during the K award period between those who transitioned and those who did not (15.6 vs 9.9, p=0.04). No differences were detected based on sex, career stage, or degree held, and these factors were not significant predictors of success based on logistic regression.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: In recent years, pediatric surgeon-scientists continue to be successful in competing for national research funding, and, similar to historical data, do not depend on K-series funding as a path to independent funding. Compared to previous eras, there was a lower proportion of surgeon-scientists who successfully transitioned from a K to an R award, which may suggest that pediatric surgeons are either no longer using the K-to-R award mechanism effectively or are not being appropriately supported by their institutions.&nbsp;

Guo<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>State University Of New York At Buffalo,Surgery,Buffalo, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Academic surgery has been evolving rapidly over the past half century.&nbsp; However, little information is available regarding the scientific surgery publications reflecting these changes. We hypothesize there has been a change in the fields of interest in the scientific publications in surgery.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science&rsquo;s Science Citation Index Expanded was queried for articles, reviews and proceedings papers published in the top 5 highest impact factor journals (JAMA Surgery, Annals of Surgery, British Journal of Surgery, Surgery and Journal of the American College of Surgeons) from 1960 to present day. Abstracts and keywords were available from 1990 to present day, whereas titles were available from 1960 to present day.&nbsp; Textual frequency analysis of paper keywords from 1990 to present day was conducted utilizing textalyzer.com to describe the most commonly appearing keywords. Co-occurrence cluster analysis of both keywords and abstracts from 1990 to present day, and titles from 1960 to present day, was conducted using software VosViewer to identify emerging trends of surgical research to determine related terms and their strength of relationships.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were a total of 68,257 articles, reviews and proceedings papers published from 1960 to present day in these five top journals. Textual frequency analysis of keywords from 1990 to present demonstrated a rise in papers referring to outcomes, quality and trials whereas there was a downward trend for studies relating to animals. Both keyword and abstract co-occurrence analysis identified changes in the fields of interest in the last decade including education, cost and performance clusters (Fig). Title co-occurrence analysis identified that research focus has shifted from case studies and reviews in the 60s and 70s to animal studies in the 80s and 90s to a more recent focus on outcomes analysis.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Substantial differences exist between decades of surgical research for fields of interest. Fields of study in &ldquo;softer&rdquo; sciences may have expanded in size the last several decades due to an increased focus on qualitative factors. Changing focuses reflect the ongoing development of new technologies from animal studies to cell lines to big data.

Wang<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of New Mexico HSC,Albuquerque, NM, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

One of the pedagogical premises of undergraduate medical education is the importance of clinical experience and context for the consolidation of clinical knowledge. This approach is exemplified by the clerkship year, which utilizes an apprenticeship model to transmit clinical knowledge and skills to medical students, and is considered the essential clinical year of training. The global COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically transformed the current third-year medical school curriculum. Due to guidelines put out by the Association of American&nbsp;Medical Colleges (AAMC) and public health agencies, there was an abrupt cessation of medical students in clinical settings followed by&nbsp;a subsequent transition to a virtual curriculum. At our institution, medical students were moved from the traditional curriculum of five 8-week clerkships and two 4-week clerkships to a split curriculum consisting of 6 months in virtual classrooms with 3-week clerkships and 6 months of in-person clinical clerkships. At the end of each virtual clerkship, students&rsquo; clinical knowledge is assessed by a high stakes National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) SHELF exam. Through this study, we seek to examine the impact of a virtual curricular&nbsp;structure on SHELF exam performance during the virtual surgery clerkship in the setting of the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We included all third-year medical students who underwent the virtual surgery clerkship through August 2020 (n=52) compared to those who underwent the traditional clerkship curriculum during the 2019-2020 academic year (n=82). Given that the scores between each administration of the clerkship exam can vary, we compared the SHELF exam percentile scores of students who completed the virtual surgery curriculum to those who completed&nbsp;the traditional curriculum.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The average surgery SHELF exam percentile score of students following the virtual curriculum was 50&plusmn;31 with a median of 46. Students who underwent the traditional curriculum had an average SHELF exam percentile of 46&plusmn;29 with a median of 45.5. Student&rsquo;s t-test was utilized for comparison of the percentile scores between the two groups of students, which demonstrated no significant differences in scores between the two groups (p=0.5).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Despite the abrupt transition into a virtual curriculum, our study demonstrates that a virtual curriculum is non-inferior to a traditional clerkship curriculum in regards to medical student performance on the surgery SHELF exam. Further comparisons must be made within the other clerkships that have also undergone a virtual transformation, as well as a comparison of clinical performance when the current third-year medical students complete the in-person clinical clerkships. This data suggests that a virtual curriculum can help students perform as well on the NBME SHELF exam as a traditional curriculum, and is a viable alternative in settings when in-person education cannot occur.

Schwaitzberg<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>State University Of New York At Buffalo,Surgery,Buffalo, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The process of obtaining informed consent is well recognized to be a critical surgical skill from a legal and ethical standpoint as well as the surgeon-patient relationship.&nbsp; It has been well reported that the majority of surgical consents in training institutions are obtained by first year residents, but there is no consistent method for teaching nor assessing a trainee&rsquo;s ability to obtain informed consent, leaving the majority of residents to learn the skill &ldquo;on the job.&rdquo;&nbsp; We seek to quantify the effect that one year of clinical experience without a formal curriculum in informed consent contributes to a resident&rsquo;s performance in obtaining informed consent from a standardized patient.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
At the start of the academic year, PGY1 and PGY2 residents in an academic surgical training program were surveyed regarding their experiences and confidence in obtaining informed consent as well as their previous formal education on the topic.&nbsp; Residents then attempted to obtain informed consent for right hemicolectomy from a standardized patient.&nbsp; A checklist was used which was created based on a review of the literature and accounted for residents&rsquo; attention to the following components: indication for the procedure, description of what to expect, risks, benefits, and alternatives, as well as their attention to assessing comprehension from the patients and facilitation of decision making.&nbsp; After excluding residents that had extra years of training, performance of PGY1 residents was compared to that of PGY2.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Two of twenty-four residents reported having any prior education in informed consent and both of these were during medical school; no other residents recalled any previous education on informed consent.&nbsp; The majority of PGY2 residents reported having each obtained over 50 informed consents.&nbsp; However, there was no difference between PGY1 and PGY2 surgical residents in their overall performance or in any of the specific seven components assessed.&nbsp; Components identified with exceptional need for improvement included a more thorough discussion of the benefits/purpose of the operation as well as suggestion of alternatives.&nbsp; Further, all residents addressed some risks of the operation but both groups performed significantly worse in addressing procedure-specific risks as compared to general risks of an operation like bleeding or infection; for example, half did not discuss anastomotic leak as a risk for right hemicolectomy.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our findings demonstrate that despite performing a large number of informed consents during their first year of training, PGY2 residents did not outperform their PGY1 colleagues who started less than a month prior.&nbsp; This demonstrates that practice did not improve performance when lacking formal education or coaching.&nbsp; A formal curriculum in the content, delivery and assessment of informed consent should be initiated upon arrival to surgical training

Mentorship has been identified as a key to&nbsp;career promotion and professional development. The Women in Surgery Committee (WiSC) of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) developed a mentoring&nbsp;program that matched young female faculty with more senior female&nbsp;surgeons for one year. We hypothesized that female senior mentorship will help junior surgeons achieve their career goals.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Pairs were based on specialty, needs basis (e.g. research, professional development, work-life balance) and geography. Over a year, each pair coordinated meetings based on individual preferences and needs. An exit survey was sent to all mentors and mentees&nbsp;4-6 weeks after completion of the program. Participants were asked to rank statements about mentorship and the value of specific aspects of the WiSC mentoring program on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). Summary statistics were used to evaluate demographic data. Participants were compared based on frequency of encounters (&gt;4 times per year vs. &lt;4 times per year) using a Mann Whitney test with significance at p&lt; 0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We&nbsp;identified 62 mentor-mentee pairs across 15 surgical specialties. Survey return response rate was&nbsp;81%. Participants were primarily assistant professors (63%) from academic teaching hospitals (74%). Overall, participants believed mentorship programs were essential for young surgeons (4.5 &plusmn; 0.9) and that limiting the program to female surgeons only added value (4.3 &plusmn; 0.8). When compared to those who met infrequently with their mentor, more engaged mentees were more likely to perceive the program and their mentors as beneficial (4.4 &plusmn; 0.9 vs 3.3 &plusmn; 0.9, p&lt;0.001). Specifically, more engaged mentees found the program valuable for achieving career goals (4.3 &plusmn; 0.8 vs 3.3 &plusmn; 0.8, p&lt;0.001), developing time-management skills (4.0 &plusmn; 0.7 vs 2.8 &plusmn; 1.0. p&lt;0.001), setting expectations (4.5 &plusmn; 0.6 vs 3.3 &plusmn; 1.0, p&lt;0.001), providing networking opportunities (4.1 &plusmn; 1.1 vs 3.4 &plusmn; 1.0, p&lt;0.05), and developing professional skills (3.8 &plusmn; 1.0 vs 2.7 &plusmn; 0.8, p&lt;0.001).&nbsp; They were also more likely to recommend the program (4.5 &plusmn; 1.0 vs 3.7 &plusmn; 0.8, p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The WiSC Mentoring Program provides a valuable opportunity for young female surgeons. Perceived benefit appears to be dependent on the level of mentoring engagement with those who meet frequently experiencing greater value.

Recent events in our country have led to renewed discussion on equality and inclusion among people of different racial, ethnic, and&nbsp; socioeconomic groups. Since surgery remains one of the most competitive medical specialties, the concept of equal opportunity deserves investigation in this context. The purpose of this study is to determine the correlation between demographic factors and manuscript acceptance in a surgical journal.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All oral and plenary abstracts that were presented at the 2017 Academic Surgical Congress (ASC) were collected from the online program and evaluated for their publication status. Gender and race of the senior author were recorded from the authors&rsquo; online university profile. National ranking of the institution for research funding linked to the senior author was also examined from the National Institute of Health (NIH) website. Pearson Chi Square and Logistic Regression analysis were run on SPSS software to analyze the data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 360 abstracts that were presented, 254 were subsequently published at 34 months following the conference. There was a positive correlation with manuscripts that were published and senior authors categorized as &ldquo;White&rdquo; (180/244) (p= 0.001) vs. senior authors of different races- &ldquo;African American&rdquo; (8/22), &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; (56/81) and &ldquo;Hispanic&rdquo; (3/3). There was no correlation between &ldquo;Male&rdquo; (198/282) vs. &ldquo;Female&rdquo; (47/70) senior authors and publication status (p=0.793). The national ranking of the institution associated with the senior author had no correlation with whether a manuscript was published (p=0.195).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Race may play a role in manuscripts that are published. Senior authors categorized as &ldquo;White&rdquo; are strongly correlated with manuscripts accepted for publication, over senior authors of a &ldquo;African-American&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hispanic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; nationality. Such a disparity may be linked to a lack of access among different races and may highlight the need for a level playing field, even among academic surgeons. Journals may want to consider blinding reviewers to authors&rsquo; names, institution, and other identifying factors.

Hayden<sup>1</sup>, A. Torquati<sup>1</sup>, A. Becerra<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Rush University Medical Center,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

The number of scientific publications is increasing exponentially. A paper&rsquo;s significance is often determined by its citation count, though this may not reflect its actual contribution to scientific advancement. Using a validated bibliometric measure called the disruption score, we identified the top 100 most disruptive randomized control trials (RCTs) in general surgery.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We included all RTCs published between 1954 and 2014 from The American Journal of Surgery, Annals of Surgery, BMC Surgery, JAMA Surgery (formerly Archives of Surgery), Journal of the American College of Surgeons, Journal of Surgical Research, Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, and Surgery, as well as surgery-specific articles from British Medical Journal, JAMA, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine, for a total of 3,436 publications. Using the equation developed by Wu et. al (Nature 2019) we calculated the disruption score for each publication, and selected the top 100.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The five RCTs with the highest disruption score are shown in the table. Among the top 100, the disruption scores range from 0.07 to 0.68. The number of citations range from 1 to 3,946. The correlation coefficient between citation count and disruption score is 0.12, indicating a weak correlation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

This project introduces a new method of identifying disruptive publications. A high disruption score suggests that a paper has displaced previous ways of thinking, thus shifting the paradigm at the time of publication. In our list,&nbsp;we noted the&nbsp;disruption score was weakly&nbsp;correlated&nbsp;with citation count,&nbsp;confirming that the score can identify unique characteristics contributing to a papers overall impact.&nbsp;

The most disruptive RCT on our list was a comparison of radical vs simple mastectomy. Most agree that the true landmark trial on this topic was NSABP B04, which has 612 citations since it was published in 2002. However, an impressive&nbsp;disruption score identifies Brinkley&#39;s&nbsp;and Haybittle&rsquo;s earlier contributions to breast cancer treatment, and the dramatic changes that would occur in the following decades. &nbsp;

The highest citation count belongs&nbsp;the NASCET trial,&nbsp;the 9th most disruptive on our list. This is still a well-known&nbsp;landmark study in vascular surgery which solidified the role of endarterectomy in the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis.&nbsp;

In summary, the disruption score provides an additional method of analyzing scientific publications. Our top 100 list provides unique perspective on the history of surgical science, and we hope it will influence future surgeons on their path to discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Borgstrom<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>West Virginia University School of Medicine,Department Of Surgery,Morgantown, WV, USA <sup>2</sup>West Virginia University School of Medicine,Morgantown, WV, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;

Medical education offerings continue to evolve and create opportunities for medical students to pursue dual degree education. These educational endeavors provide important framework and formal education in ancillary fields directly related to surgery, which gives trainees and surgeons important and diverse perspectives on surgical care. This study sought to assess current prevalence of additional advanced degrees among leaders in academic surgery in order to determine whether or not there is an association between dual degree attainment and holding leadership positions within surgical departments.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The Association for Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) database was used to identify academic surgical programs, which comprised our study population. Each department of surgery website in the APDS database was interrogated for departmental leaders and their reported academic degrees.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

We identified 264 programs in the APDS directory, 229 of which were identified as academically structured programs. We identified 3,249 surgeons as holding leadership roles within their departments based on website position titles and affiliations. We found that 500 (15.4%) of these surgeons possessed advanced educational degrees in addition to their medical degree. Among those possessing such degrees, the most common degrees included PhD&rsquo;s (172, 34.4%), MPH&rsquo;s (96, 19.2%). MBA&rsquo;s (75, 15.0%), MSc (70, 14.0%) DDS/DMD (26, 5.2%), and MEd (20, 4.0%). Chairpersons were significantly more likely to possess advanced educational degrees compared to other leaders in the cohort (p = 0.0116). Only 173 chairpersons were able to be identified in the cohort of collected leaders, of whom 35 (20.2%) possessed advanced degrees. MBA&rsquo;s (12, 31.4%), PhD&rsquo;s (11, 25.7%), and MPH&rsquo;s (5, 14.3%), comprised the majority of chairpersons advanced educational degrees. Using program websites, we were only able to definitively identify 196 general surgery residency program directors, 26 (13.3%) of whom were identified as having advanced educational degrees. Exactly 1,000 department of surgery division chiefs were found to possess 168 advanced degrees (16.8%). Residency program directors and division chiefs possessed similar distributions of advanced degrees as chairpersons. The remainder of identified leaders (1,880 surgeons) largely consisted of vice chairpersons, fellowship program directors, fellowship directors, and administrative leadership roles and were responsible for 271 advanced degrees within the cohort (14.4% prevalence).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
A relatively small fraction of leaders in academic surgery possess advanced educational degrees in addition to their medical degree. While perhaps valuable for understanding complexities and nuance of the healthcare system, possessing such formal training does not appear to be a key factor in one&rsquo;s advancement and ascendance to positions of leadership in academic surgery roles.

Wakefield<sup>1</sup>, G. Gill-Wiehl<sup>1</sup>, L. Friedman<sup>1</sup>, A. Shah<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Rush University Medical Center,Surgery,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Competency-based evaluations play a role in the promotion of academic surgeons. Currently, there is a known disparity in the number of leadership positions held by female compared to male surgeons.&nbsp; The aim of this study was to investigate the role gender plays in these evaluations by examining quantitative and qualitative differences in medical student teaching assessments of attending surgeons.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Medical student evaluations of all attending surgeons at a single institution over a ten-year period were retrospectively reviewed in this single-blinded study. Numerical scores of female versus male attendings were compared across 11 categories using Mann-Whitney U tests. Subjective evaluations were analyzed using NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software. Using an exploratory method, we identified prevailing themes within the comments, coded the evaluations based on these themes, and compared the coded comments based on gender.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

3,337 evaluations of 52 attending surgeons (19 females, 33 males) were included over a 10-year period. Objective scoring of female and male attendings was comparable in 4&nbsp;of 6 categories, with female attendings achieving significantly higher scores in the areas of &ldquo;Enthusiasm&rdquo; and &ldquo;Clear Expectations&rdquo; when compared to male attendings (Table 1). Four major themes were identified within the subjective evaluations, which included personality descriptors, statements on abilities as a surgeon, statements on abilities as an educator, and expressions of reverence. Although comments were largely comparable between groups, subtle differences emerged within several of the pre-determined themes. For example, students expressed stronger comments of reverence for male compared to female attendings, describing males as &ldquo;department chair quality&rdquo; or as an &ldquo;indispensable asset&rdquo; to the program. Critiques of female surgeons&rsquo; abilities as educators were more focused on lack of clear expectations whereas males were viewed as being abrasive and belittling.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

In contrast to prior studies, medical student teaching evaluations of male and female attending surgeons were largely comparable across all categories. Findings from this study may reflect the improving gender balance within the field of surgery. Interestingly, female faculty scores were higher than male faculty scores in the areas of enthusiasm and clear expectations; however, subtle biases were observed within the subjective comments that reflected traditional gender stereotypes.

In gauging faculty&rsquo;s perception of publishing research, we hoped to better understand their motivations, the extent they feel their research is supported by their institution, and the stress associated with academic productivity. Furthermore, we investigated whether responses differed significantly depending on faculty rank of respondents.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A 26-question survey was sent electronically to all faculty with an active clinical practice in the Department of Surgery. The survey queried perceived level of departmental support for research, motivation for research, perception of research enhancing clinical care, and extent to which academic productivity serves as a personal stressor.&nbsp; Survey participation was voluntary, and responses were anonymous. Faculty was split into two groups based on academic rank: senior defined as professors and junior defined as associate or assistant professors. The median answers provided by each group were then compared using a Welch Two Sample t-test; a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We received 39 completed surveys (response rate 38%). Using the initial analysis, junior faculty (n=24) were more likely to report that they conduct research for professional advancement, whereas senior faculty (n=12) reported that they conduct research for their own personal enjoyment (p &lt; 0.01). Junior faculty were also more likely to state that publishing their research was a significant stressor, whereas senior faculty did not report similar stress (p &lt; 0.01). There were no significant differences between faculty perception of institutional support for research, influence of colleagues&rsquo; research on personal research, and the enhancement of research on clinical care.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;All surveyed faculty believe that academic research enhances clinical care (n=30), and 72% believe that academic research positively impacts patient perception of physicians (n=29). However, junior faculty seem to conduct research primarily for professional advancement and report greater stress associated with publishing when compared to established professors. Understanding the varied motivations for research and the publication pressures experienced by different groups may enable institutions to optimize resource allocation to better support junior faculty in their professional development.

As burnout amongst medical students progresses through training, we sought to impact this trend by incorporating a dedicated wellness time for students on the Surgery clerkship.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Eighty-seven students in the third-year Surgery clerkship during Fall 2018 (39) and 2019 (48) were evaluated. Four hours weekly of dedicated wellness time was incorporated into the 2019 clerkship. Students were encouraged to use this time for self-care and study.&nbsp; They were compared to a 2018 matching cohort, prior to the change.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Absence requests decreased from 21 (54%) in 2018 to 11 (23%) in 2019.&nbsp; The most frequent absence reasons in 2018 were for illness (67%), followed by conference attendance (19%).&nbsp; In 2019, family events (36%) were most frequent followed by conference presentations (27%).&nbsp; There was only one request for illness in 2019.&nbsp; Mean shelf exams scores and clinical evaluations were similar between cohorts.&nbsp; 31% of student feedback mentioned wellness time as a positive experience.&nbsp; Student comments regarding professionalism issues decreased by 27%.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Dedicated wellness time in a Surgery clerkship coincided with less overall student absence from clinical rotations due to illness.&nbsp; The dedicated time did not appear to negatively impact shelf scores or clinical evaluations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Carlisle<sup>1,2</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Iowa,Surgery,Iowa City, IA, USA <sup>2</sup>Universisty Of Iowa,Bioethics And Humanities,Iowa City, IA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;The medical school surgery clerkship is viewed by many students as demanding - often pushing them to their perceived physical and academic limits. Graduating medical students across institutions rate the surgery clerkship less favorably than non-surgical clerkships and report frequent mistreatment. General surgery programs have studied interventions to improve students&rsquo; experiences with limited success. Here, we assess students&rsquo; preconceived notions prior to the clerkship as well as perceptions after completion of the clerkship in an effort to gain insight into how clerkship leaders might dispel preconceived attitudes that may impact student experiences.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;This is a two-part&nbsp;exploratory&nbsp;study of medical students at a midwestern academic medical center investigating attitudes toward surgeons and the surgical clerkship. Part 1 involved three&nbsp;60-minute focus groups with pre-clinical medical students. Focus groups were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim.&nbsp;Emerging themes were captured through qualitative content analysis.&nbsp;Part 2 involved a brief online survey of students who had completed the clinical portion of their surgical clerkship. Descriptive statistics were tabulated.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;20 students participated in the focus groups. Societal stereotypes and comments from senior medical students informed perceptions of surgeons as&nbsp;&ldquo;particular,&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;focused,&quot;&nbsp;&ldquo;confident,&quot;&nbsp;&ldquo;hyper-competitive,&quot;&nbsp;&ldquo;egotistical,&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;maniacal,&rdquo;&nbsp;or as having a &ldquo;god-complex&rdquo;.&nbsp;Students expressed concern about&nbsp;hostile work environments, unsatisfactory work-life balance, poor academic performance, and viewed surgeons as less &ldquo;humanistic&rdquo; than non-surgeons. Most students hoped to be&nbsp;integrated into the surgical team, develop suturing and physical exam skills, and learn management of post-operative patients. 12 (24% response rate) students have participated in the post-clerkship survey to date. 50% had no previous interaction with surgeons prior to their clerkship. Following their clerkship, students described surgeons as &ldquo;intense,&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;adaptable,&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;creative,&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;thoughtful,&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;hard-working,&rdquo;&nbsp;and &ldquo;busy&rdquo;. 50% of students expected to be treated poorly by surgical attendings but reported being treated well, while 25% had a similar interaction with residents. 50% anticipated being treated well by residents and/or staff and were treated well. Only 33% felt this way about attendings. 42% had a different opinion of surgeons after their surgery clerkship.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Pre-clinical students have pre-conceived notions of surgeons and the required surgery clerkship that may impact their educational experience and limit their satisfaction with the clerkship.&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing these concerns intentionally and preemptively with pre-clinical students or students early in their surgical clerkship may enhance the learning environment.

Milone<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Brooklyn Hospital Center,Department Of Surgery,Brooklyn, NY, USA <sup>2</sup>St. George's University School Of Medicine,St. George's, St. George's, Grenada","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Medical student education, particularly the core clinical curriculum, has recently been subject to change at multiple institutions. This has sparked a deeper look at the aspects of each clinical rotation as an attempt to create the best learning experience for the medical student. Variability between programs can lead to differences in student opinions of general surgery, leading to changes in residency applications. These differences may be more evident when comparing university-affiliated and community hospital training programs. Here we assess student and resident opinions of the general surgery clerkship and compare training programs between university-affiliated and community-based training hospitals.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A voluntary survey was provided electronically to current students and residents to assess their opinions of their general surgery clerkship. Demographic, hospital, and rotation data was collected and students who had not completed their rotation were censored.&nbsp;

To assess the quality of student education, respondents were asked to assess the frequency of educational and non-educational duties. Educational duties included operative experience and&nbsp;presenting to attending surgeons or senior residents on rounds. Non-educational duties included obtaining vitals, patient transport, and basic procedures (ie. venipuncture). Presence of a formal medical student education was based on the ACS/ASE Medical Student Core Curriculum.

Respondents were also asked their subjective opinions regarding strengths and weaknesses of their rotation, along with their satisfaction of the rotation overall and with their education.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of the 108 respondents who completed the survey and their general surgery rotation, 36 were at university-affiliated hospitals (36/108, 33.3%) and 72 at community hospitals (72/108, 66.7%).

69 (61.1%) responses were from third year students, 25 (22.1%) from fourth year students, and 19 (16.8%) from general surgery residents (17 PGY-1, 2 PGY-3). Comparison of a medical student educational program showed no difference between community and university programs (69.0% v. 66.7%, p=0.81). There was no difference in the presence of hands-on training between community and university programs (54.9% v. 61.1%, p=0.81).

There were no statistical differences between educational (84.51% v. 91.67%, p=.30) and non-educational activity (56.3% v. 61.1%, p=0.64) at community and university hospitals, respectively. Comparison of trainee opinions on the quality of their rotation shows a trend towards higher educational satisfaction at university hospitals v. community hospitals (6.22 v. 5.19, p=0.085), but no difference in overall enjoyment (5.56 v. 5.22, p=0.60) or 24 hour call requirement (50.0% v. 41.7%, p=0.42).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

Despite no difference between hands-on training, educational and non-educational activity, or enjoyment, students showed a trend towards higher educational satisfaction at university-affiliated general surgery programs.

Sandhu<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Beaumont Health System,Department Of Surgery,Royal Oak, MI, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Michigan,Department Of Surgery,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Student entrustment with participation in procedures has been decreasing over the past 25 years resulting in poorly prepared graduates for internship. While students wish to have more participation, they may not be equipped to optimize clinical experiences and promote involvement in procedures. This study explores factors associated with student entrustment in procedures with the goal of informing students of barriers to and facilitators of increased procedural participation in their clerkships.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
In May 2016, students completing their core clinical year at a single medical school were surveyed on attitudes and participation in 90 procedures (e.g. cryotherapy, incision/drainage, paracentesis, central line placement, first assisting in surgery) across 6 core clerkships, with participation used as an objective proxy for entrustment. Entrustment scores were created incorporating procedural complexity. Procedural (anesthesia, emergency medicine, surgery and surgical subspecialties, obstetrics/gynecology) and nonprocedural (e.g.&nbsp;internal medicine, pediatrics, radiology, etc.) groupings were created based on reported specialty of interest. Scores were compared using independent t-tests and/or Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
138/210 medical students responded (66% response rate). Entrustment was not associated with gender (entrustment score of men versus women,&nbsp;54.98&plusmn;16.07 versus 52.22&plusmn;13.57,&nbsp;p=0.275), race (p=0.516), or Myers-Briggs personality dyads (p=0.531). Greater entrustment was experienced by students interested in procedural specialties (56.90&plusmn;14.11 versus 51.35&plusmn;14.45 for nonprocedural specialties, p=0.028)&nbsp;and those with more positive attitudes towards procedures (r=0.182, p=0.032).&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Findings from this study suggest that students who demonstrate a positive attitude towards procedures and are forthcoming with their interests in procedural specialties engender greater entrustment from supervisors. Educators can highlight these behaviors to students to empower and enhance engagement among learners in the clinical environment.&nbsp;

Experiences during clinical rotations are key to decision-making. During rotations, students receive mentoring and supervision from attending and resident physicians, both of whom may profoundly influence the students&rsquo; perception of a specialty. Previous studies demonstrated the influence of attendings and residents on medical students&rsquo; career choices, but their respective influence is not yet established. The purpose of this study was to gain better understanding of the extent to which attendings and residents influence medical students&rsquo; career choices, specifically regarding general surgery and surgical specialties.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;An IRB-exempt 14-question survey was created using a modified Delphi technique, and piloted prior to distribution. This anonymous, voluntary, web-based survey was sent to rising fourth year medical students and new graduates at our institution. In addition to demographic information, respondents identified differences in the influence of attendings and residents on their career choice. Descriptive statistics were performed on demographics; 5-point Likert responses underwent non-parametric analyses (&alpha; = 0.05).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The response rate was 21% (60/282). 57% were female. 43% (26/60) chose a surgical specialty (general surgery (GS), OB/GYN, plastics, orthopedics, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, urology, ENT); 9 students are pursuing GS. Residents and attendings combined had the greatest influence on all career selections (48%), followed by residents-only (28%) and attendings-only (23%); the trend persisted for surgical specialties. Residents were rated to be more supportive and approachable, more encouraging of students to pursue their specialty, involved students more, provided better feedback, and set fairer expectations compared to attendings. Attendings were rated to explain difficult concepts more clearly and had greater knowledge (p &lt; 0.005). Attending (62%) and resident (57%) influence was cited by respondents who chose a different specialty than they intended to pursue when entering medical school. Attending (88%) and resident (100%) influence was cited amongst those changing their intended career to GS, as well as clarified misconceptions of the field (50%). Respondents pursuing GS rated residents more enthusiastic than attendings. GS attendings received more positive ratings for explaining difficult concepts, compared to other attendings.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;This study demonstrates that while both attendings and residents are key influencers of medical student career choices, residents hold greater overall influence. Students choosing a career in general surgery and surgical specialties viewed the mentoring skills of residents in higher regard. These findings provide clinical educators with valuable insights to improve student experiences and career recruitment, and to drive institutional culture change regarding the clinical education of students.

Lau<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Stanford University,Surgery,Palo Alto, CA, USA <sup>2</sup>Howard University College Of Medicine,Surgery,Washington, DC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Medical training has undergone many facets of restructuring over the past couple of decades, including the development of work hour restrictions and changes in management strategies. Adequate case exposure and volume is imperative to facilitate residents&rsquo; mastery of technical skills for independent practice. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the trends of general surgery residents&rsquo; case exposure and volume over the past two decades.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Case Log Statistics Reports from 1999 to 2019 were reviewed. Case logs were grouped into defined case categories and level of postgraduate training. Descriptive analyses were performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The total major average cases per resident increased by 10.7% (p&lt;0.001).&nbsp;Although there was an increase in maximum vascular surgery cases, the average total vascular surgery cases performed by residents&nbsp;decreased by 40.3% (p&lt;0.001). Evaluation of defined cases shows a decrease in operative trauma with an increase in nonoperative trauma, abdomen, and alimentary cases. Junior level residents also have seen a significant increase in exposure to critical care cases while chief residents&rsquo; exposure has remained relatively stable. No significant changes were noted in 2003 after the implementation of duty hour restrictions.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Evaluation of trends shows that residents, despite changes in duty hour restrictions and management strategies are still exposed to an adequate volume of cases. However, these trends do not necessarily depict the effect of specialized surgery centers, presence of fellowship programs, or correlate to resident autonomy. Future studies will attempt to assess residents&rsquo; perceptions of competency and autonomy, impact of specialized centers and fellowship programs, and effects on patient outcomes.

Corey<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Division Of Gastrointestinal Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Beginning in March 2020, general surgery residencies across the United States have been increasingly impacted by COVID-19. It has become imperative to limit potential exposure of the resident workforce and identify those with known/potential disease exposure, symptom development, and perceived inability to attend work. Many residencies initiated a platoon scheduling approach, with select residents held in reserve to maintain their health. As electronic survey tools are an increasingly popular means of quickly gathering and storing data for a variety of purposes in surgical education, we hypothesized that the use of survey tools to track individual resident readiness to work would be an effective and useful means for collecting information about resident workforce status.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
To assess the health and overall state of the resident workforce, a daily email check-in was created using the Qualtrics survey tool. This tool was designed to assess if residents were experiencing symptoms, felt they were able to work, or had questions or concerns about the state of resident operations. Participation was voluntary but encouraged.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The survey was dispersed via email to each general surgery resident at a large academic center daily from March 26, 2020 to June 8, 2020. A total of 2,225 surveys were distributed to 58 unique recipients. 948 total responses were collected from 51 unique respondents. There were 14 total responses indicating a subjective inability to work, with 6 (42.9%) of those indicating at least one of the following symptoms: shortness of breath, fever &gt; 100.4, myalgia, or cough.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The ability of surgical residency leadership to track the health status of individual residents and the resident workforce has never been more paramount than during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study shows that an electronic survey tool can be used as an effective platform to track resident health status and readiness to work. Identifying further uses for electronic survey tools in surgical education may guide how resident wellness and health are followed in the future, and may have many other useful applications.

R. Cortez<sup>1</sup>, C. Morris<sup>1</sup>, R. C. Quillin<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Cincinnati,Department Of Surgery,Cincinnati, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

General surgery (GS) was once the gateway into a career in surgery. Over time surgical subspecialties (SS) birthed their own residency programs and more recently, integrated programs (IS) have come into existence. However, it is unknown what impact the presence of SS and IS programs have had on GS. Our objective was to evaluate and quantify match trends among applicants to GS, IS, and SS.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

National Residency Matching Program reports from 2010 through 2019 were analyzed to evaluate trends between groups. IS included Plastic, Vascular, and Thoracic Surgery. SS included Otolaryngology, Orthopedic Surgery, and Neurosurgery. Groups compared were applicants per position, rankings per applicant and match rate.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Over the past decade there was a median 25,820 (IQR 24402-27782) US graduates. Median number of GS applicants was 1298 (IQR 1270-1359), SS 1422 (IQR 1357-1477), and IS 290 (IQR 263-320). The proportion of graduates going into GS, SS and IS was 5.1% (IQR 4.9-5.1%), 5.6% (IQR 5.2-5.7%) and 1.12% (IQR 1.1-1.2%). Median applicants per position was 1.08 for GS, 1.86 for SS and 1.34 for IS (p&lt;.0001). GS match rate was 72.8%, SS 77.7%, and IS 65.0%, (p&lt;.0001). Median rankings per applicant was 10.5 (IQR 10.0-10.8) for GS, 10.9 (IQR 10.8-12.2) for SS and 10.1 (IQR 7.5-11.1) for IS (p=.01).

Over time GS applicants increased 1262 to 1388 (+10%, p&lt;.005) while positions increased 1077 to 1432 (+33%, p&lt;.001), and applicants per position decreased from 1.17 to 0.97 (p=.003). Percent matched increased 70.1% to 75.8% (p&lt;.003), and rankings per applicant increased 9.43 to 11.43 (p&lt;.0001). For SS, positions increased 1127 to 1315 (+17%, p=.0001), but the number of applicants and applicants per position remained stable (p=.224, p=.07). The SS match rate did not change (p=.06), but rankings per applicant increased 10.55 to 12.27 (p=.0002). For IS, number of applicants increased 265 to 327 (+23%, p=.0001) as did positions (101 to 275, +272%, p&lt;.0001). Applicants per position decreased 2.53 to 1.19 (-53%, p=.002). Percent matched increased 34.4% to 74.6% (+217.1%, p=.0005), and rankings positions per applicant 5.3 to 11.5 (+219.7%, p&lt;.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

From 2010 to 2019, GS and IS have experienced the highest percent increase in available positions, and GS remains lowest in applicants per position. This may be attributed to applicants who may have otherwise chosen GS now applying to IS.&nbsp; Further work to better compare the competitiveness and attractiveness of surgical residencies is warranted.

Levine<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania,Surgery,Philadelphia, PA, USA <sup>2</sup>Children's Hospital Of Philadelphia,Pathology,Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Renal Ischemia Reperfusion Injury (IRI) is a major contributor to early allograft dysfunction (EAD) in kidney transplantation.&nbsp;We previously demonstrated lower rates of EAD among female renal transplant recipients in the UNOS registry, and using a murine model, we showed improved&nbsp;IRI tolerance with administration of supplemental&nbsp;17&beta;-estradiol (E2). There are two isoforms of the estrogen receptor, estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) and estrogen receptor beta (ER&beta;), and expression of each isoform varies by cell type. We have shown decreased ischemia tolerance in ER&alpha;&nbsp;knockout mice (ER&alpha;-KO) but improved tolerance to ischemia in ER&beta; knockout mice (ER&beta;-KO). Given the therapeutic potential of manipulating the estrogen receptors with E2, understanding the role of the ER&beta; in renal IRI is essential. Here, we have used a transplantation model to assess whether the role of ER&beta; is intrinsic to the kidney or systemic, as well as tissue specific ER&beta; knockout models in vascular endothelium (Tie2-Cre) and renal tubular epithelium (Pax8-Cre).
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We transplanted&nbsp;kidneys from&nbsp;C57BL/6(B6)&nbsp;donor mice into B6 recipient mice, ER&beta;KO kidneys into B6 recipients, and B6 kidneys into ER&beta;KO recipients, followed by native nephrectomy. All groups subsequently underwent standardized renal IRI.&nbsp;In separate experiments, female Pax8-Cre (+) ER&beta;<sup>-/-</sup>&nbsp;mice and Tie2-Cre (+) ER&beta;<sup>-/-</sup>&nbsp;mice were subjected to warm&nbsp;renal ischemia along with female, B6 controls. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr) were measured at 24-, 48-, 72- and 96-hours after surgery.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;ER&beta;-KO mice that received B6 kidneys (B6=&gt;ER&beta;KO) had significantly higher BUN and Cr compared to B6 mice that received ER&beta;KO kidneys (ER&beta;KO=&gt;B6) (p&lt;0.001) and significantly higher Cr than B6 mice that received B6 kidneys (B6=&gt;B6) (p &lt;0.05, Figure 1). Similarly, Tie2-Cre (+) ER&beta;<sup>-/-&nbsp;</sup>mice had significantly lower BUN (p&lt;0.001) and Cr (p=0.03) compared to B6 controls. Pax8-Cre (+) ER&beta;<sup>-/-</sup>&nbsp;mice did not have a significant difference in BUN/Cr from B6 controls.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Transplantation of a kidney from a WT mouse into a ER&beta;-KO mouse exacerbates renal IRI, but whole-body deletion of ER&beta; from vascular endothelium is protective. Deletion of ER&beta; from renal tubular epithelium is not protective. These novel findings suggest that the protective mechanism of ER&beta; deletion is located both within the kidney and within the vasculature, suggesting that a functioning ER&beta; in the renal vasculature mediates the ischemia reperfusion injury. Further understanding of this pathway will guide development and understanding of therapeutics that effect the&nbsp;ER&alpha; and&nbsp;ER&beta; receptors.

Ravnic<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Penn State University College Of Medicine,Plastic Surgery,Hershey, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Success of engineered grafts continues to be limited by time to vascularization following implantation.&nbsp; It has been appreciated that inflammation and macrophage accumulation are intricately involved with neovascularization in implanted grafts and engineered tissues. We recently described a simple microsurgical approach that can rapidly vascularize and perfuse an adjacently placed non-anastomosable collagen graft by creating a localized pro-angiogenic environment. We hypothesize that recipient vasculature micropuncture induces graft neovascularization by the rapid accumulation of inflammatory macrophages.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The femoral artery and vein of Sprague-Dawley rats (N=10) were micropunctured (MP) at defined intervals using a 60 &micro;m diameter&nbsp;prior to coverage with a Type I collagen scaffold. The contralateral limb served as a normal (non-MP) intrinsic control. Collagen grafts and the underlying vascular segment were explanted en bloc after 24, 48, and 72 hours. Thin sections were prepared for histologic analysis using both trichrome and immunofluorescence staining. Total cellular infiltration into the grafts was assessed per high powered field with endothelial cell (CD31/PECAM-1) and macrophage (F4/80) accumulation quantified. Western blot protein analysis was performed for confirmation.&nbsp; Statistically significant differences were defined as P &lt; 0.05 using the one-tailed Student&rsquo;s t test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Collagen grafts overlying the micropunctured vessels demonstrated a highly significant (p &lt; .001) increase in the % area of total infiltrated cells compared to non-MP control grafts at all time points (11.22 vs. 7.31 at 24 hours, 16.35 vs. 11.36 at 48 hours, and 23.49 vs. 17.78 at 72 hours). Macrophage accumulation followed a similar trend in MP grafts when compared to control grafts: 18.57 vs. 8.00 at 24 hours (p = .001), 30.67 vs. 15.17 at 48 hours (p = .014), and 33.71 vs. 27.64 at 72 hours (p = .075). This paralleled the increased levels of endothelial cells seen in MP grafts: 29.83 vs 8.00 at 24 hours (p = .002), 42.17 vs. 16.6 at 48 hours (p = .035), and 62.38 vs. 45.36 at 72 hours (p = .001). Western blotting corroborated these findings with 1.40-, 1.77-, and 1.36-fold increases of F4/80 and 2.35-, 2.69-, and 7.19-fold increases of CD31 in the MP grafts at 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Here we show that surgical priming of the recipient vasculature influences cellular infiltration and neovascularization of adjacently placed engineered collagen grafts. Macrophages play an essential role in graft vascularization; however, under normal circumstances their accumulation is slow and angiogenesis is delayed. With concurrent vascular micropuncture at the time of graft implantation these deficiencies are remedied.&nbsp; Without causing significant injury to the recipient vasculature, this microsurgical tactic represents a novel approach in regulating inflammation for the benefits of engineered graft neovascularization.

Lunsford<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Rutgers New Jersey Medical School,Division Of Transplant And HPB Surgery,Newark, NJ, USA <sup>2</sup>Houston Methodist Hospital and Research Institute,Department Of Surgery - Transplant,Houston, TEXAS, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;Early morbidity and mortality following liver transplant (LT) relates to infection and pre-transplant immune dysfunction (i.e. immune frailty) in more the 60% of recipients. We previously identified a pre-LT plasma biomarker panel, the immune frailty index (IFI), which predicts early post-transplant mortality due to immune dysfunction. While shift in T cell lineage and dysregulation of immune cell differentiation and maturation appear to contribute to pre-LT immune dysfunction, the genetic mechanisms responsible remain largely unknown.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;IFI was calculated from pre-transplant HCV viremia, Eotaxin, MMP3, and Fractalkine levels above median values, as previously described. IFI-high patients (score 3-4) were matched 1:2 with IFI-low (score 0-2) based on age, gender, and cause of liver disease. Blood collected from normal healthy volunteers served as control. Peri- and post-operative patient characteristics, labs, infectious complications, and survival were tracked. RNAseq was performed on PBMCs isolated at time of LT, and gene expression results were correlated with patient clinical outcomes. Gene enrichment analysis was performed using iPathwayGuide (Advaita Bioinformatics, Ann Arbor, MI).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Pre-transplant characteristics were similar between patients. Two-year survival was significantly worse in IFI-high (56%, n=5/9) vs IFI-low (100%, n=18/18, p&lt;0.01). IFI-high experienced more frequent early post-op infections (p=0.05) and higher incidence of early post-transplant pneumonia (p=0.02). IFI-high also had more positive cultures within 1yr (median 3 vs 1, p=0.04). Among IFI-high patients who died (n=4), 3/4 (75%) died secondary to immune-related complications (infection and recurrent malignancy). The fourth patient experienced graft failure secondary to non-compliance with immunosuppression. RNA seq of deceased patients demonstrated 23 differentially expressed genes. Analysis suggested pre-LT dysregulation of genes implicated in antigen-presentation, cancer and viral infection susceptibility, immune cell-related transcriptional motifs, and dysfunctional liver metabolism (Figure 1).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Dysregulation of immunomodulatory pathways can result in aberrant expression of genes related to competent immunity. This may direct pre-transplant immune dysfunction/frailty, and likely increases LT recipient susceptibility to infections and death. This phenomenon may account for a large proportion of early post-LT deaths. Further evaluation of these pathways may offer a potential novel target to interrupt pre-transplant immune dysfunction and improve LT outcomes.

Lidsky<sup>1,3</sup> <sup>1</sup>Duke University Medical Center,Surgery,Durham, NC, USA <sup>2</sup>Duke University,Pharmacology And Cancer Biology,Durham, NC, USA <sup>3</sup>Duke Cancer Institute,Durham, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive primary liver cancer with a high mortality rate. There has been a 128% rise in ICC incidence over the past 40 years in the United States, potentially linked to increases in obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Because most patients are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic disease, only 20% undergo curative-intent resection, with the majority of patients treated with systemic chemotherapy. Unfortunately, current therapies are not highly effective, yielding a median overall survival less than 1 year. Here, we use a high-throughput, unbiased approach to identify candidate essential genes and potential new therapeutic targets in ICC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

CRISPR/Cas9 essentiality screens were performed on 5 ICC cell lines using a customized 2,400 gene library targeting epigenetic modifiers, DNA damage modifiers, genes commonly upregulated in cancer, the full kinome, genes with FDA-approved agents, and a series of universally essential (positive) controls and negative controls. Screen results were compared to the publicly available DepMap dataset to identify strongly essential candidate genes specific to ICC. We then focused on validating essentiality of two genes, CACNA1G and CACNA1A, using targeted gene knockdown by RNAi in paired cell viability and clonogenic assays in two ICC lines (RBE and SSP-25) and pancreas (PANC0327) and colorectal (CRC119) cancer cell lines.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

CRISPR/Cas9 replicate versus replicate plots of the log<sub>2</sub>-fold change in construct abundance between final (T<sub>F</sub>) and initial (T<sub>0</sub>) cell populations confirmed reliability of the screen. Relative log-depletion scores &lt;-1.8 in at least 60% of samples was required for gene inclusion. Cross-referencing to DepMap yielded 75 genes that were strongly essential in ICC cell lines but rarely essential in other cancers, two of which were CACNA1G and CACNA1A. These genes were essential in 8% and 2% of cell lines in DepMap, respectively. Targeted gene knockdown by RNAi in RBE, SSP-25, PANC0327 and CRC119 lines resulted in cell death in the ICC lines but not the pancreas and colorectal cancer cell lines (Figure 1), which was validated using a second independent hairpin targeting each gene.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
These data demonstrate that CACNA1G and CACNA1A are candidate genes of essentiality in at least two ICC lines, RBE and SSP-25. These genes encode voltage-gated calcium channel subunits alpha1G and 1A. Prior work demonstrates that combining a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and chemotherapy synergistically slows tumor growth in an explanted tumor mouse model of ICC. Given recent progress in using CCBs to modulate melanoma and lung cancer progression, these drugs may also be a therapeutic option for ICC.

Intimal hyperplasia (IH) has remained a common problem in the field of vein graft failure (VGF) with minimal clinical success. In recent years, few genomic studies have shed light on potential therapeutic targets for IH. Here, we aim to perform a meta-analysis on transcriptomic profiles to find a potential global signature for prevention and treatment of VGF.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We included two temporal transcriptomic studies: one on whole vein graft tissue (study1-PMID: 14981462) and the other on endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) harvested from vein graft (study2-PMID: 22720046). A third study on aortic ECs exposed to wall sheer stress was also included (study3-GSE29376). Datasets were Robust Multichip Average (RMA)-normalized, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between vein graft vs control (study1,2) and pressure vs no pressure(study3) were elucidated using the limma-R package (p&lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub> fold change (lfc)=1), represented by heatmaps. Additionally, for subtle genomic changes, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed (p&lt;0.05 and FDR &lt;0.3), and common enriched pathways were identified between the groups categorized into early (study 1,2 early time points plus study 3) and late (study 1,2 late time points) time-point groups. Genes from these common enriched pathways were derived by leading edge analysis (picked based on lfc =0.25 from DEGs analysis). Both, differential genes and GSEA based genes were subjected to the WGCNA based correlation analysis (z score &lt;2 for non-conserved modules between graft and control). Further, cytoscape based interactive network analysis was performed, and the top 100 hub genes were identified (scored by centrality, stress, degree and closeness). Finally, genes associated with significant pathways from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were boxplotted to visualize the changes and patterns through studies 1, 2, and 3.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The GSEA analysis demonstrated 16 common enriched pathways, primarily related to immune response, between early and late time-point groups. Further, WGCNA-cytoscape-IPA analysis revealed 113 genes with significant changes to gene expression between control and experimental groups. Visualization of the boxplot data suggested changes in gene expression for VEGFB, PTTG1, RCF4, JUN, EGR1, TCF4, and RHOBTB1 across all three studies.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our analysis, comprising of diverse models (canine, bovine) and including hemodynamic sheer stress effects, whole tissue comparisons, and cell-specific contributions towards early and late stage VGF, has identified potential genomic signature comprising of 113 genes implicated in immune response, cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix remodeling, providing potential targets for future therapeutics to treat IH.

There is a known gap between the number of patients who medically require transplant and the number of organs available. Xenotransplantation can potentially address this gap. Initial setbacks due to hyperacute and acute rejection have been mitigated with pigs genetically engineered to knock out highly immunogenic xenoantigens. Now, pig-to-baboon life-supporting renal xenotransplant models have demonstrated long-term rejection free survival, bringing xenotransplant closer to becoming a clinical reality. In recent serological studies, knockout of one of the xenoantigens, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), has been shown to decrease human antibody binding but increase binding with baboon antibodies. Unlike humans, baboons naturally express Neu5Gc and it is postulated that deletion of this gene may lead to exposure of other antigens immunogenic to baboons. We wanted to explore the clinical implications of these findings in a previously tested pig-to-baboon transplant model.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The goal of this study was to compare the survival and graft histopathology in baboons receiving life supporting kidney transplants from pig donors who either expressed Neu5Gc (GTKO pigs, group 1) or did not express Neu5Gc (GTKO/CMAHKO termed Double KO or &lsquo;DKO&rsquo; pigs, GTKO/CMAHKO/B4GALNT2 KO termed Triple KO or &lsquo;TKO&rsquo; pigs, group 2). All donor pigs were also engineered to express genes previously shown to regulate coagulation and inflammatory responses. All baboons received a previously proven anti-CD40mAb-based immunosuppressive regimen. Histopathology was based on the BANFF scoring criteria where applicable and a number of histologic features were noted.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Group 1 baboons (n=5) had a median survival time of 237 days with 2 kidneys revealing histopathological features of antibody-mediated rejection including vascular inflammation, fibrin thrombi formation, and immunoglobulin deposition in renal interstitial arteries and peritubular capillaries. Group 2 baboons (n=5) had a significantly shorter median survival time of 61 days with 4 grafts revealing features of antibody-mediated rejection.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Baboons receiving a xenotransplant from pig donors genetically modified to not express Neu5Gc have decreased survival time and appear more likely to mount an adaptive immune response than baboons receiving grafts from pig donors that express Neu5Gc. Given the serological studies showing reduced human antibody binding to pig cells that do not express Neu5Gc, the optimal pig for clinical trials would likely contain this mutation. The results of this study point more toward a limitation with the currently accepted pig-to-baboon xenotransplant model and should not impede clinical xenotransplantation.

Hrebinko<sup>1</sup>, T. R. Billiar<sup>1</sup>, K. P. Mollen<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Pittsburgh,Division Of Pediatric Surgery/Department Of General Surgery,Pittsburgh, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is spectrum of chronic and relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise mechanism of IBD has yet to be elucidated, key to this inflammatory process is the recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRR). Cyclic-GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) is a recently discovered cytoplasmic PRR that senses both pathogenic and self-DNAs. cGAS has been demonstrated to promote cell death as well as autophagy, a cellular mechanism that removes dysfunctional cellular components by transporting them into double membraned vesicles for degradation. We hypothesize that cGAS plays a key role in intestinal homeostasis by maintaining the crosstalk between cell death and autophagy in IBD.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We evaluated intestinal mRNA expression and protein levels of cGAS in patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC, n=4), Crohn&rsquo;s disease (CD, n=4), and controls (n=4). Subsequently, we performed a standard 7-day 2% Dextran Sulfate Sodium colitis model on cGAS KO (n=16) and WT C7/B6 mice (n=13).&nbsp;We assessed the disease activity index (DAI) scores comprised of weight loss, stool consistency, and bleeding. We evaluated the tissue via qPCR, western blot analysis, H&amp;E staining, immunofluorescence (IF), and TUNEL assay.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We found significant increases in cGAS mRNA expression in patients with UC (p&lt;0.01) and CD (p=.02). IF and WB demonstrated increased cGAS protein in IBD patients. Our results also demonstrate cGAS KO mice to have worsened severity of colitis compared to WT mice when subjected to experimental colitis. This was demonstrated by significantly higher DAI scores (p&lt;.01), shorter colon lengths (p&lt;.01), increased pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&szlig;(p&lt;.01) and TNF-&alpha; (p&lt;.01), as well as increased gross tissue damage seen with H&amp;E staining. We report decreased expression of the key autophagy initiation protein, Beclin-1 (p&lt;0.01), decreased autophagic flux demonstrated by decreased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (p=0.05), and increased levels of p-62 protein expression signifying disruption of autophagy in cGAS KO mice subjected to experimental colitis compared to WT mice. In our investigation of cell death via IF our data demonstrates significantly higher TUNEL staining (p&lt;.01), as well as increased staining for RIPK-3 and p-MLKL signifying increased necroptotic cell death in cGAS KO mice subjected to DSS when compared to WT mice subjected to experimental colitis.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
CGAS has been shown to play a key role in the defense against pathogens as well as a stimulator of autoimmune inflammation. Our data suggest that cGAS plays a key role in maintaining the intestinal epithelial homeostasis during human IBD and murine colitis by regulating a homeostatic balance between autophagy and cell death.&nbsp;

Prolonged dependence on PN carries a dose- and time-dependent increase in the likelihood of developing intestinal failure associated liver disease (IFALD). IFALD is characterized first by cholestasis and subsequently can cause progressive liver failure requiring transplantation or lead to death. New therapies are needed to reduce morbidity and mortality for children with IFALD. SEFA-6179 is a fully-synthetic medium chain fatty acid engineered to maximize fatty acid-sensitive pathway signaling by limiting rapid intracellular metabolism. Here, we investigate SEFA-6179 in treating parenteral nutrition-induced liver injury in a murine model of IFALD.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Eight-week-old, male C57BL/6 mice were fed chow as control or liquid PN in a model of IFALD. Mice on PN diet were administered medium chain triglycerides (MCT) as vehicle control or SEFA-6179 (264 mg/kg) via orogastric gavage every other day. After 19 days, mice were then sacrificed, and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver histology were analyzed. A second experiment was performed using chow or PN diet, orogastric gavage with MCT or SEFA-6179, and the addition of intravenous tail vein injections with saline as control or soybean oil-based lipid emulsion (Intralipid) every other day. Liver histology and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (UHPLC-MS) of liver tissue were analyzed for lipid content.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;PN diet induced hepatic steatosis, as evidenced by intracellular lipid accumulation on histology (A, column 2). Treatment with SEFA-6179 prevented hepatic steatosis (A, column 4). PN diet caused non-statistically significant increases in serum AST and ALT which were reduced by SEFA-6179 (B). SEFA-6179 attenuated hepatic steatosis induced by concomitant administration of PN diet and intravenous Intralipid (C). On UHPLC-MS, liver samples from mice on PN diet with and without Intralipid exhibited significant increases in hepatic cholesterol esters and the pro-inflammatory, arachidonic acid metabolite 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE). These elevations were prevented by SEFA-6179 (D).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Treatment with SEFA-6179 prevents hepatic steatosis induced by PN alone and PN with concomitant intravenous Intralipid. SEFA-6179 attenuates PN-induced elevation in serum AST and ALT. The mechanism by which SEFA-6179 exhibits hepatoprotection may be through reducing hepatic cholesterol esters and the pro-inflammatory mediator 12-HETE. Treatment with SEFA-6179 has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality in children with IFALD.

Prior studies suggest that multi-drug resistant tumors are more metastatic relative to their parental wild-type (WT) cells but the mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated. Inhibition of the interaction between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) has been successfully used for treatment of multiple advanced adult cancers, but has yet to be explored in pediatric solid tumors.&nbsp; In this study, we investigated the expression of PD-L1 in osteosarcoma to determine the potential usefulness as a target for drug therapy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We used Human WT osteosarcoma (SJSA-1) cell line and created a doxorubicin resistant (DoxR) cell line via incubating WT cells with incremental concentrations of doxorubicin.&nbsp; Resistance was determined by a 100-fold difference in half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC-50) on 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) calorimetric assay. Matrigel in vitro invasion assays were used to compare invasiveness of WT to DoxR cells. Western blot assays were used to compare PD-L1 expression in WT and DoxR cells. Chi-square tests were used to determine significant difference in percent invasion.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A DoxR cell line was successfully created with IC-50 of 1.8x10^5 compared to that of WT cells, 1.9x10^7. DoxR cells were significantly more invasive than WT cells (0.47 vs. Y0.07, p&lt;0.001). Expression of PD-L1 was present in DoxR cells but not in WT cells based on Western blot assays.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
PD-L1 is expressed in DoxR but not WT osteosarcoma cells and may be involved in the regulation of drug resistance and cancer invasiveness.&nbsp; Further studies exploring the invasiveness and expression of PD-L1 with inhibition of the PD-1, PD-L1 interaction are needed to determine the possible utility as a target for drug therapy.&nbsp;

Metastatic hepatoblastoma continues to pose a significant treatment challenge, in part, because the precise mechanisms involved in metastasis are not yet fully understood. We have previously established human metastatic hepatoblastoma cell line variants that exhibited enhanced tumorigenicity and invasiveness along with increased phosphorylation of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), a key regulator of tumor metastasis in various cancers. Using these metastatic hepatoblastoma cells, we aimed to assess whether the enhanced invasiveness in vitro is dependent on CXCR4. We hypothesized that CXCR4 blockade with the small molecule inhibitor AMD3100 would inhibit the migration and invasion of metastatic hepatoblastoma cells.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The human hepatoblastoma cell line, HuH6, and the metastatic variant, HLM, were utilized. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of AMD3100 (0-30 &micro;M) for 24 hours. CXCR4 cell surface expression was assessed by flow cytometry using an anti-CXCR4-PE antibody that competes with AMD3100 in binding to epitope 12G5. Migration was evaluated using transwell assays, and a layer of Matrigel was added to the upper chamber to evaluate invasion. Data were normalized to untreated HuH6 cells and reported as mean &plusmn; standard error of the mean. Student&rsquo;s t-test was used with p&le;0.05 determined significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: HLM cells had higher CXCR4 surface expression than HuH6 cells (57 &plusmn; 2 compared to 35 &plusmn; 0.5 percent in HuH6 cells, p&le;0.001, Figure 1C, black bars). Treatment with AMD3100 decreased the percentage of cells labeled with the anti-CXCR4 antibody in both HuH6 and HLM cell lines (p&le;0.05, Figure 1C-D), indicating blockade of the CXCR4 receptor and successful inhibition of the desired target. HLM cells exhibited enhanced migration and invasion at baseline compared to HuH6 cells (4 &plusmn; 0.3 and 3 &plusmn; 0.1 fold change, respectively, p&le;0.01, Figure 1A-B, black bars), confirming a more invasive phenotype. AMD3100 treatment of both cell lines decreased migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner (p&le;0.05, Figure 1A-B). AMD3100 at higher concentrations reduced invasion of HLM cells to levels comparable to those seen in treated HuH6 cells, indicating that CXCR4 contributes to the in vitro invasiveness of HLM cells.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Blockade of CXCR4 decreased the migration and invasion of metastatic hepatoblastoma cells, suggesting that CXCR4 inhibitors may be an effective therapeutic adjunct in the treatment of hepatoblastoma.

Targeted treatment strategies are needed for these children that cannot be cured with surgery alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have shown promising results in the treatment of various malignancies. We sought to characterize HDAC gene expression in HB samples and determine the most effective HDACi strategy for HB.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: HDAC gene expression was screened in a cohort of 50 HB patients in comparison to six uninvolved liver samples with microarray analyses and further validated by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in several HB cell lines and pooled normal liver. Several HDACi agents that target different groups of HDAC genes including panobinostat (pan inhibitor), mocitinostat (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3), entinostat (HDAC1, HDAC3), and romidepsin (HDAC2, HDAC3) were tested with cytotoxicity assays (MTT). Immunoblotting assays were used to assess changes in drug targets and induction of apoptosis (PARP cleavage) with cell lines.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Patient tumor samples showed clear differential expression of HDAC gene expression, including strong upregulation of class I HDAC genes&nbsp;HDAC1,&nbsp;HDAC2,&nbsp;HDAC3, and&nbsp;HDAC4&nbsp;with selective downregulation of&nbsp;HDAC10&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;HDAC11&nbsp;which was further confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;Overexpression of&nbsp;HDAC2&nbsp;and&nbsp;HDAC3&nbsp;was shown to be the most upregulated&nbsp;HDAC&nbsp;genes as compared to normal liver with statistically significant increases in HB cell lines HepG2, HepT1, B62, HuH6, and HB17 (p=&lt;0.05).&nbsp;&nbsp;Panobinostat (IC<sub>50</sub>&nbsp;of 0.01-0.05&nbsp;&micro;M) showed strong effects in&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;assays for viability while immunoblotting with panobinostat-treated cells showed an increase in acetylated histone H3 and H4 and an increase in cleaved PARP indicating cell death.&nbsp;&nbsp;In vitro assays also demonstrated efficacy of HDACi mocetinostat (IC<sub>50</sub>&nbsp;of .556-4.31&micro;M), entinostat (IC<sub>50</sub>&nbsp;of 3.06-10.91&nbsp;&micro;M), and romidepsin (IC<sub>50</sub>&nbsp;of .001-.02&nbsp;&micro;M),

Lee<sup>1</sup>, D. H. Chung<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,Pediatric Surgery,Dallas, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;The high-risk group of neuroblastoma (NB) remains the most difficult to treat with frequent resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Epigenetic modifications in NB may attribute to refractoriness to multi-modality treatment regimens. We have previously found that &alpha;&nbsp;-N-catenin, a cell-adhesion protein, plays a tumor suppressor role in non-MYCN amplified NB by inhibiting the NF-&kappa;B signaling pathway. In addition, advanced-stage NB patients have decreased expression of the gene CTNNA2, which encodes for&nbsp;&alpha;-N-catenin. A subset of NB tumors that lack &alpha;-N-catenin are resistant to all-trans-retinoic-acid (RA). Recently, we demonstrated that re-expression of &alpha;-N-catenin enhanced sensitivity to RA. However, the mechanism of CTNNA2 silencing in NB remains unknown. Herein, we sought to determine the mechanism of &alpha;-N-catenin silencing in NB.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  &nbsp;Epigenetic modification occurs through DNA methylation or histone modification. In order to distinguish between methylation or histone modification, human NB cell lines SK-N-AS and SHEP, which lack endogenous &alpha;-N-catenin expression, and BE(2)-C cells that express &alpha;-N-catenin, were treated with 5-azacytidine (5AZ), a methylation inhibitor, and Trichostatin A (TSA), a deacetylase inhibitor. The expression of CTNNA2 and its downstream targets was examined with qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. Cell survival was measured with a CCK-8 kit assay

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Treatment with 5AZ did not induce &alpha;-N-catenin expression. TSA treatment induced CTNNA2 expression in SK-N-AS and SHEP cells and increased CTNNA2 expression in BE(2)-C cells. TSA treatment also increased the expression of the CTNNA2 downstream targets including: p21, p27, GADD45G and TNF-&alpha;. TSA treatment decreased cellular proliferation in all 3 cell lines. Treatment with RA and TSA, in combination, increased CTNNA2 expression and decreased cellular proliferation in RA-resistant cell lines, SK-N-AS and SHEP. &nbsp;However, in the RA-sensitive cell line, BE(2)-C, there was no added benefit of combination RA and TSA treatment. In combination with RA, cellular proliferation of the SHEP cells was inhibited at a dose three-times less than TSA alone.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The expression of &alpha;-N-catenin is silenced in advanced-stage NBs; this was reactivated epigenetically by histone modification. RA and TSA synergistically induce CTNNA2 expression, and in turn, cellular differentiation, as well decrease cellular proliferation in NB. Combination therapy allows for significantly lower doses of RA and TSA. We conclude that &alpha;-N-catenin is a potential biomarker for response to RA therapy and that combination treatment with TSA and RA may improve survival among children with high-risk, RA-resistant NB.

Chan<sup>1</sup>, S. K. Sherman<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Iowa,Department Of Surgery, Carver College Of Medicine,Iowa City, IA, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Chicago,Department Of Surgery,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) correlated with worse survival compared to proficient MMR (pMMR) among metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients in a recent National Cancer Database (NCDB) study. Young adults with mCRC may have higher rates of dMMR, but its impact on survival in this population is incompletely understood. This study sought to assess patterns of MMR testing and survival among young adult mCRC patients in the NCDB, hypothesizing that dMMR correlates with worse survival.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Stage-IV colorectal cancers in patients &le; 30 years old were identified in NCDB (2010-2016). Demographic and clinical features were compared between younger and older mCRC patients, and tested for association with overall survival. Stage-IV disease and absence of other recorded metastatic sites defined isolated peritoneal metastases. Fisher exact tests compared proportions and Cox models tested association with overall survival.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 124,587 stage-IV colorectal cancers, 1,123 patients were 30 years of age or younger. Young patients were less often white (59.1 vs 74.6%) and were more likely to have mucinous histology (16.4 vs 9.0%), high-grade tumors (28.7 vs 20.5%), rectal or rectosigmoid primaries (34.6 vs 26.9%) and isolated peritoneal metastases (28.5 vs 18.6%; p&lt;0.001 for all). Although younger patients more often had MMR-testing (29.1 vs 16.6%, p&lt;0.001), dMMR was found at similar rates in young and older patients (21.7 vs 17.1% of those tested, p=0.2).&nbsp; Despite higher rates of adverse prognostic features, younger patients had better survival (median 20.7 vs 14.8 months, p&lt;0.001). In young patients, primary site, race, sex, and KRAS status did not correlate with survival (p&gt;0.5). Peritoneal metastases and mucinous histology showed some association with worse survival (p=0.06 for both). Significantly worse survival was observed in those with high-grade (HR 2.54) and right-sided tumors (HR 1.59, p&lt;0.05 for both). Among young adults with MMR-testing, dMMR correlated with higher risk of death compared to pMMR (median survival 16.6 months vs 25.5 months, HR 1.63, p=0.01, Figure). &nbsp;A multivariable model included factors with univariable p&lt;0.1.&nbsp; Grade, tumor location, and MMR status remained independently associated.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Deficient mismatch repair is a marker of poor prognosis in younger adults in NCDB with mCRC. Median survival was worse with dMMR by 8.9 months compared to pMMR patients. Despite higher rates of familial syndromes in young patients and recommendations for universal MMR-testing, over 70% of young mCRC patients had no MMR-status recorded. Increased MMR-testing in this population will identify patients eligible for immune therapy, which could improve outcomes in the future.

Neuroblastoma (NBL) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children with poor survival rates for high-risk tumors. Although RAS genes are infrequently mutated in NBL, RAS activity has been implicated in NBL tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that RAS activity is required for NBL tumor establishment and inhibiting RAS can delay tumor formation. We tested this hypothesis on an orthotopic NBL xenograft model and developed NS1, a RAS monobody, that specifically inhibits HRAS- and KRAS-mediated signaling by targeting a critical allosteric regulatory site, thereby preventing RAS activation of downstream effectors. Monobodies are single-domain proteins of ~95 amino acids that achieve levels of affinity and selectivity similar to antibodies yet are insensitive to the redox potential of their environment.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We stably infected a NBL cell line SK-N-FI with a lentivirus encoded with doxycycline (DOX)-regulated NS1 expression construct that allowed for chemically regulated NS1 expression (and RAS inhibition) both in vitro and in vivo (SK-N-FI-NS1). Western blot was performed on SK-N-FI-NS1 cells to evaluate for suppression of RAS activity. Equivalent amounts of lysate were incubated with GST-RAF RBD (GST fusion-protein, corresponding to the human Ras Binding Domain of Raf-1) to pulldown active RAS. Orthotopic NBL xenografts were generated by injecting one million SK-N-FI-NS1 cells into the left adrenal gland of immunocompromised nude mice. After injection, mice received fresh water +/- DOX every other day for up to 2 months. Tumors were tracked with ultrasound twice weekly. Once tumors reached &gt;1000mm<sup>3</sup>, animals were euthanized.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
SK-N-FI cells are not MYCN amplified, have low MYCN but high HRAS expression (Fig 1A). SK-N-FI-NS1 cells demonstrated a decrease in RAS activity after NS1 induction with DOX (Fig 1B). Mice that did not receive DOX induction began to develop adrenal tumor starting 13 days after adrenal gland injection with SK-N-FI-NS1 cells, while those treated with DOX did not until day 30 (Figure 1C). On post-cell injection day 34, all non-DOX animals had developed tumor, while only 60% of DOX-treated animals did.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
NS1, a RAS monobody, is a powerful tool to assess the role of RAS in NBL. Induction of NS1 results in delayed NBL tumor formation, and this suggests that the RAS-MAPK pathway can be potential therapeutic targets for NBL treatment.

The objective of the current study was to improve the prognostic accuracy of the 8<sup>th</sup>edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for ICC with the establishment and validation of a new staging system.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Data from an international multi-institutional database (1999-2017)(n=643) and the SEER registry (1975-2016)(n=797) were used as development and validation cohorts, respectively. A modified TNM (mTNM) was proposed by redefining the 8<sup>th</sup>AJCC T categories, and incorporating the recently proposed N status as&nbsp;N0 (no lymph node metastasis [LNM]), N1 (1-2 LNM) and N2 (&gt;3 LNM), as well as adopting a new stage classification.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The 8<sup>th</sup>TNM staging system failed to stratify patients with stage II versus IIIA, stage IIIB versus IV, as well as overall stage III versus IV relative to long-term overall survival (OS) in both databases (multi-institutional database: median OS, stage II 37.8 vs. IIIA 50.8 months,&nbsp;p=0.314; IIIB 18.9 vs. IV 17.0 months,&nbsp;p=0.256; III 20.7 vs. IV 17.0 months,&nbsp;p=0.058; SEER registry: median OS, stage II 33.0 vs. IIIA 88.8 months,&nbsp;p=0.636; IIIB 18.0 vs. IV 15.5 months,&nbsp;p=0.858; III 18.9 vs. IV 15.5 months,&nbsp;p=0.779) (Figure).Based on multivariable analysis, perforation of visceral peritoneum (HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9-1.6,&nbsp;p=0.219) was removed from the T definition, whereas multiple tumors (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.1,&nbsp;p&lt;0.001), tumors with periductal infiltration (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.3,&nbsp;p&lt;0.001), as well as tumors involving local extrahepatic structures by direct invasion (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6,&nbsp;p=0.012) were defined as T4 in the new staging system. There was a monotonic decrement in survival based on the proposed mTNM staging classification among patients derived from both the multi-institutional (median OS, stage IA 101.4 months, IB 66.3 months vs. stage IIA 45.2 months, IIB 37.1 months vs. stage III 18.9 months vs. stage IV 16.4 months, all&nbsp;p&lt;0.05) and SEER registry (median OS, stage IA 73.0 months, IB 85.1 months vs. stage IIA 46.0 months, IIB 24.5 months vs. stage III 17.7 months vs. stage IV 14.2 months, all&nbsp;p&lt;0.05) datasets (Figure). On multivariable analysis, mTNM staging remained strongly associated with prognosis, as the hazard of death incrementally increased with each stage among patients in the two cohorts.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The modified 8th AJCC TNM staging system for ICC using the new T and N definitions improved stratification of patients relative to long-term OS versus the original 8<sup>th</sup>AJCC staging, and therefore should be considered for potential adoption in the next AJCC staging manual edition.

The impact of obesity on postoperative outcomes including operation-specific complications, morbidity, and mortality remains understudied for patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy for benign and malignant pancreatic disease.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy were abstracted from the 2014-2018 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program&nbsp;PUF Targeted Pancreatectomy dataset and were included in the study. Patients were stratified into three BMI categories: non-obese (BMI 18.5-29.9); class 1/2 obesity (BMI 30-39.9); and class 3 severe obesity (BMI&gt;40). Patients with BMI&lt;18.5, ASA class 5 and emergency operations were excluded. Bivariable analyses tested associations between patient factors and 30-day postoperative outcomes including NSQIP-defined composite morbidity, mortality, delayed gastric emptying (DGE) and postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). Multivariable logistic regression models tested independent associations between patient factors and outcome measures.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 16,823 patients were included in the study: 12,234 (72.7%) non-obese; 4,030 (24%) obese; and 559 (3.3%) severely obese. Obesity and severe obesity were associated with younger age and lower rates of smoking (both p&lt;0.001), however greater incidence of preoperative comorbid conditions: hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, dyspnea, and higher rates of ASA class of 3 or 4 (p&le;0.008).&nbsp;Both severe obesity and obesity were associated with a greater likelihood of post-operative complications when compared to non-obese patients, including POPF (29.3% vs 23.2% vs 15.5%, p&lt;0.001); DGE (20.2% vs 17.5% vs 15.4%, p=0.001), composite morbidity (41.0% vs 38.2% vs 32.5%, p&lt;0.001), and mortality (1.8% vs 2.2% vs 1.3%, p&lt;0.001).

Historically, Medicaid and uninsured surgical patients have been less likely to benefit from regionalized complex surgery at high-volume hospitals (HVH). Whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA)&rsquo;s Medicaid expansion has decreased disparities in access to HVH for complex surgery remains unknown. This multi-state quasi-experimental study sought to evaluate the effects of this expansion on the utilization of HVH among Medicaid and the uninsured (MCD/UIS) for pancreatic surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The State Inpatient Databases (2012-2017), American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database, and Area Resource File from Health Resources and Services Administration, were linked to examine 8,264 non-elderly adults (ages 18-64) who underwent pancreatic resections at 296 unique hospitals within nine expansion states (AZ, CO, KY, MA, MD, NJ, NM, NV, WA) and two non-expansion states (NC, FL). HVH thresholds were defined via Leapfrog of 20+ resections per year on average. Linear probability triple differences models were estimated to measure the impact of expansion on utilization rates of MCD/UIS patients relative to the privately insured in expansion versus non-expansion states over pre-/post-ACA.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

39 hospitals were identified as stable HVH over time. Overall, adjusted pre-/post-ACA utilization rates of HVH for pancreatic surgery remained unchanged (66.3% vs. 66.4%, p=0.94). In expansion states and among the MCD/UIS populations, there was a significant increase in HVH utilization rates (pre- vs. post-ACA 48% vs. 55.4%, p=0.047). Prior to expansion, a gap was found in utilization of HVH between expansion states vs. non-expansion states among MCD/UIS patients (77% vs. 48%, p&lt;0.0001), which was reduced after the expansion by 15.1% (p=0.001). Further, a pre-ACA gap between expansion vs. non-expansion states was larger for MCD/UIS relative to privately insured patients by 24.9% (p&lt;0.0001), which was also significantly reduced by 11.2% (p=0.022) in post-ACA period. Triple differences models interacting payer, expansion state status, and pre-/post-ACA showed an increase in utilization of HVH by the MCD/UIS populations relative to the privately insured in expansion states (triple difference estimate +11.7 percentage points, p=0.022) (Figure). Utilization rates among the privately insured remained relatively flat post-ACA.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

This large quasi-experimental evaluation demonstrates that ACA&rsquo;s Medicaid expansion increased utilization of HVH for pancreatic surgery among MCD/UIS surgical patients. Though it needs to be confirmed with patient outcomes, the ACA may improve pancreatic surgery outcomes via expanded access to HVH. These findings may be informative to non-expansion states that are considering expansion.

Mortality from COVID-19 often occurs from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with progression to Multisystem Organ Failure (MSOF) characterized by cardiogenic shock and right ventricular dysfunction. We hypothesized that right ventricular dysfunction is the&nbsp;primary determinant of MSOF and early Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) and right ventricular support utilizing&nbsp;a percutaneous Right Ventricular Assist Device (RVAD) could eliminate end-organ failure and reduce mortality.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective analysis of a single institution between March 1 and July 6, 2020 was performed of&nbsp;patients admitted to the intensive care unit with severe COVID-19 ARDS.&nbsp; Non-intubated patients, those with acute renal failure, and age &gt; 75 were excluded. Patients who underwent RVAD/ECMO support and those who were managed via invasive mechanical ventilation alone (IMV) were compared. RVAD/ECMO institution was attempted within 24 hours of intubation. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality, acute renal failure, length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 145 patients were admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 pneumonia. Thirty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria and met Berlin criteria for severe ARDS. Twenty-one received IMV-alone and 18 early RVAD/ECMO. Patient characteristics were similar. Treatment regimens were similar except for use of tocilizumab (23.8 vs 61.1%, p=0.025) and convalescent plasma (9.5 vs 66.7%, p=0.001) which were received more by RVAD/ECMO patients.&nbsp; In-hospital mortality (52.4 vs 11.1%, p=0.008), 30-day mortality (42.9 vs 5.6%, p=0.011), and Kaplan-Meier cumulative mortality (Log-rank p=0.009) were significantly lower in RVAD/ECMO patients. No RVAD/ECMO patients developed acute renal failure versus 71.4% of IMV patients (p&lt;0.001).). ICU (11.5 vs 21 days, p=0.067) and hospital (14 vs 25.5 days, p=0.054) length of stay were longer for RVADM/ECMO but not statistically significant. There were no RVAD/ECMO device complications. The duration of mechanical ventilation was shorter for RVAD/ECMO but not statistically significant (10 vs 5 days, p=0.44). The most common RVAD/ECMO complication was bleeding (25.0%).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Early RVAD support at the time of VV ECMO initiation for severe COVID-19 ARDS resulted in the elimination of secondary end-organ damage and improved survival when compared to patients treated utilizing invasive mechanical ventilation, with an insignificant trend toward shorter intubation. Management of severe COVID-19 ARDS should incorporate right ventricular support.

Palliative Surgery (PS) can be performed, but the outcomes of PS have not been described. The purpose of this study was to describe the outcomes of PS&nbsp;in patients with esophageal cancer.&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to identify patients with esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer who received PS, or other palliative treatments (P-other) (palliative radiation or palliative chemotherapy (without surgery)) from 2004-2015. Patients with missing follow-up data were excluded. The outcome of interest was overall survival. Characteristics of patients were compared between PS and P-other groups using rank sum or chi square. Survival differences between groups was performed using Kaplan Meier estimate and log rank test, and Cox proportional hazards model.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;14,589 patients were included in the analysis, including 2,812 (19.2%) receiving PS and 11,777 (80.7%) receiving P-other (6,512 palliative radiation and 5,265 palliative chemotherapy). Relative to P-other, the use of PS decreased during the study period form 249/974 (25.5%) in 2004 to 168/1,600 (10.5%) in 2015 (p&lt;0.001). PS patients differed from other forms of palliation in that PS patients tended to be older (70 vs 67 years, p&lt;0.001), female (715/2,812 (25.4%) PS vs 2,449/11,777 (20.8%) P-other, p&lt;0.001), more likely to be clinical N0 (812/2,014 (40.3%) PS vs 2,590/8,960 (28.9%) P-other, p&lt;0.001) and clinical M0 (1,748/2,763 (63.3%) PS vs 2,949/11,544 (25.6%) P-other, p&lt;0.001). PS patients were also less likely to be treated at an academic program (1,217/2,788 (43.7%) PS vs 5,883/11,610 (50.7%) P-other, p&lt;0.001). Median overall survival in PS patients was 5.5 months and was worse than P-other (6.4 months, p=0.004). Cox proportional hazard modeling, however, suggested no difference between PS and P-other when corrected for age, sex, nodal status, metastases, Charlson score, histology, academic program, and private insurance (HR 1.03 (0.975-1.090), p=0.281) (Table).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Although similar to other palliative modalities, Palliative Surgery in advanced esophageal cancer is associated with poor overall survival. Palliative Surgery for esophageal cancer patients should be used sparingly given these poor outcomes.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried for all patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit for esophageal cancer with and without concurrent lung resection between 2006-2017. Transhiatal esophagectomy patients were excluded.&nbsp; Perioperative outcomes were compared between patients who underwent esophagectomy alone (EA) versus combined esophagectomy and lung resection (EL).&nbsp; Predictors of perioperative morbidity and mortality, including combined surgery, were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Among the 6,225 patients who met inclusion criteria, 6,068 (97.5%) underwent esophagectomy alone and 157 (2.5%) underwent combined esophagectomy with lung resection. In the EL group, 20 patients had an anatomic lung resection while 137 patients had a wedge resection. There were no differences between the EA and EL groups with respect to age, gender, race, preoperative smoking status, major co-morbidities, functional dependency, and ASA classification.&nbsp; Operating time for EL was longer than EA (median 416 vs. 371 minutes, p&lt;0.01).&nbsp; Median length of stay was 10 days for both groups.&nbsp; Perioperative mortality was not significantly different between EL and EA patients (5.1% vs. 2.8%, p=0.08).&nbsp; EL patients had higher rates of postoperative pneumonia (22.3% vs. 16.2%, p=0.04) and sepsis (11.5% vs. 7.1%, p=0.03), but major complication rates overall were similar between EL and EA (40.8% vs. 35.3%, p=0.16).&nbsp; Combining lung resection with esophagectomy was not independently associated with increased postoperative morbidity (AOR 1.21 [95% CI 0.87-1.69]) or mortality (AOR 1.63 [95% CI 0.74-3.58]).&nbsp; Predictors of major complications based on multivariable analysis include increasing age, dependent functional status, current smoker, COPD, cardiovascular disease, and ASA class 4-5.&nbsp; Increasing age, black race, dependent functional status, COPD, and ASA class 4-5 predicted increased mortality, however, elevated BMI compared to normal BMI predicted lower mortality (AOR 0.68, p=0.03).&nbsp;&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Concurrent lung resection with esophagectomy does not increase mortality or overall morbidity but is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia beyond esophagectomy alone.&nbsp; Surgeons considering combining lung resection with Ivor Lewis, McKeown, or thoracoabdominal esophagectomy should carefully consider a patient&rsquo;s risk for pulmonary complications and consider pre-operative interventions to optimize their respiratory function.

Although the sequelae of pulmonary hypoplasia has been well investigated with established animal models, the mechanism of how physical compression alters the cascade of lung development has not yet been revealed at the molecular level. In this study, we evaluated the impact of physical force on lung branching morphogenesis in early gestation using a novel ex vivo model based on a state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) printing technique which mimics the mechanical compression observed in CDH.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Embryonic lungs were harvested from pregnant mice at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and randomly assigned into two groups: control group and model group. Lung explants were placed in a drop of Matrigel in air-liquid interphase (ALI) condition. Chemically modified Polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution was applied on the explants, and a 3D structure surrounding the lung of the model group was created by selective crosslinking of polymers induced by a two-photon laser excitation. The samples were incubated over 48 hours after the 3D printing and compared between the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Compressed lungs showed decreased&nbsp;branching morphogenesis resulting in decreased number of the terminal buds compared to the controls (21.5 &plusmn; 2.8 vs 28.9 &plusmn; 5.4, p &lt; 0.001). Cell proliferation analysis with immunofluorescence demonstrated a lower proportion of Ki67 positive cells (12.2 &plusmn; 2.8 % vs 19.6 &plusmn; 7.1 %, p &lt; 0.001) and increased expression of cleaved Caspase 3 (11.9 &plusmn; 3.5 % vs 3.8 &plusmn; 1.9 %, p &lt; 0.001) in the model group. Moreover, compressed lung manifested thickened mesenchyme, quantified by a rate of the parenchymal area to the airway area, which showed significant difference between the model group and the control group (2.63 &plusmn; 0.59 vs 1.47 &plusmn; 0.18, p &lt; 0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We demonstrated delayed branching morphogenesis and altered morphology in the compressed lung model. This ex-vivo model is useful to dynamically evaluate how mechanical compression affects lung development, which may determine the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia of CDH. A clear understanding of the molecular pathways responsible for disease progression will pave the way for a more targeted and non-invasive therapeutic approach, thereby contributing to improved outcomes of severe CDH.

Post-surgery prescription (rx) opioids may lead to opioid misuse and diversion, however there is limited data to support this assumption. This study quantifies post-surgery rx opioid use, misuse, diversion and compliance with disposal of unused pills.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A 40 question survey assessing post-surgery rx opioid use, misuse, diversion, and disposal patterns of unused opioid pills was developed and administered to participants using Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowd-sourcing worksite. The validated opioid risk tool (ORT) was used. Misuse was defined as taking post-surgery rx opioids in a way other than instructed by a provider and diversion was defined as having ever shared, sold, or had their post-surgery rx opioids stolen. Eligible respondents were US adults aged &gt;17 years who had received a post-surgery rx opioid in the last 5 years. Respondents were excluded if they failed an internal validity check or were identified as a robot. Multiple regression analyses identified risk factors associated with post-surgery rx opioid misuse or diversion.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

966 respondents met the eligibility requirements. Respondents were from all 50 states and demographics were similar to that of the US population. 52.2% were male and 78.6% self-identified as white. The majority of respondents were aged 30-39 years (42.7%) and had an associate&rsquo;s or bachelor&rsquo;s degree (55.6%). Overall, 34.4% of respondents were given a post-surgery rx opioid lasting more than one week and 7.6% refilled their rx after three months. Almost a third of respondents kept their unused rx opioids pills (n=299, 31.0%). Personal misuse of post-surgery rx opioids was reported in 34.5%. On multivariable regression, risk factors for misuse included working in healthcare, scoring either moderate or high risk on the ORT, experiencing an elevated mood after taking opioids, refilling the opioid rx, and keeping (not disposing) of any unused opioid pills (Figure 1A). Diversion of opioids was reported in 22.0%. Risk factors for diversion included working in healthcare, undergoing plastic surgery, scoring moderate or high risk on the ORT, experiencing an elevated mood, and keeping any unused pills (Figure 1B).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Within a sample population, a third of US adults reported personal misuse of post-surgery rx opioids and a fifth reported diversion. Almost a third did not dispose of unused opioid pills, which was associated with an increased risk for both misuse and diversion. Use of the ORT and asking patients if they experienced an elevated mood while taking opioids may help identify patients at risk. Efforts to improve proper disposal of unused pills may also reduce the risk of misuse and diversion.

Nguyen<sup>2</sup>, B. Najafi<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine,Department Of Surgery,Houston, TX, USA <sup>2</sup>Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center,Medical Care Line,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Assessment of physical frailty (PF) is recommended to evaluate risk of surgical intervention and track recovery post-surgery in older adults. Current PF assessment tools are resource intensive and unsuitable for remote assessment. Five times sit-to-stand test (5xSTS) could be a practical method for remote assessment of PF using tele-medicine. Although a few studies have demonstrated that 5xSTS correlates with PF, no study has reported whether 5xSTS can objectively quantify PF and frailty phenotypes. Acknowledging this limitation and recent efforts to shift from face-to-face to remote assessments, we investigated the effectiveness of 5xSTS with wearable sensors to identify PF and three key frailty phenotypes (slowness, weakness, and exhaustion) in older adults.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Eighty older adults (76.6&plusmn;7.9 yrs) performed 5xSTS while wearing 5 wearable sensors (LEGSys<sup>TM</sup>, BioSensics, MA, USA) attached to the trunk, left and right thighs, and left and right shanks. Fried frailty phenotype assessment was used to assign them to a PF group (n=40) or non-PF group (n=40); PF was determined with presence of at least one phenotype. We defined six sensor-derived parameters to quantify PF phenotypes. Slowness was determined by 5xSTS duration (s5xSTSd), hip angular velocity range (HAVR), and knee angular velocity range (KAVR); weakness was determined by hip angular power range (HAPR) and knee angular power range (KAPR). Exhaustion was determined by coefficient of variation of vertical velocity range (CVVVR). In addition, we manually recorded 5xSTS duration (m5xSTSd) using a stopwatch. Between group differences were assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the agreement between the s5xSTSd and the m5xSTSd. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between PF and the 6 sensor-driven outcome measures. Two PF-predictive models were built; model 1 used s5xSTSd, and model 2 used the 6 sensor-driven outcome measures as the independent variables. Area-under-curve (AUC) was calculated for the two models.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Significantly lower HAVR (p&lt;0.0001), KAVR (p=0.001), HAPR (p=0.002), KAPR (p=0.029), CVVVR (p=0.036) and significantly slower s5xSTSd (p&lt;0.0001) and m5xSTSd (p&lt;0.0001) for the PF group compared to the non-PF group were observed. An excellent agreement was observed between the s5xSTSd and the m5xSTSd (p&lt;0.0001, r=0.93). Results suggest that Model 2 (sensor-derived metrics) has noticeably superior AUC compared to Model 1 (s5xSTSd) with AUC of 0.81.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our study suggests that PF and the three key frailty phenotypes (slowness, weakness, and exhaustion) can be objectively quantified by 5xSTS with wearable sensors. Wearable sensor-based motor capability assessment holds great potential for remote assessment via telemedicine. Future study warrants to explore validity of sensor-based 5xSTS to remotely determine PF and risk of adverse outcomes post-surgery.

What surgeons say and how they say it impacts the patient&rsquo;s ability to participate, but little is known about the length and content of typical surgeon talk in consultations. The objective of this study is to quantitate the length and categorize the content of long talk by surgeons during conversations about major surgery.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed secondary analysis on audio-recorded outpatient surgical consults between 43 surgeons and patients 60 years and older considering major vascular or oncologic surgery at 5 medical centers. We randomly selected 4 transcripts from each surgeon in the cohort. Each uninterrupted block of speech, or utterance, was quantitated by character length and content coded by at least 2 of 6 coders with discrepancies adjudicated through social moderation. The codes tagged utterances with typical elements of preoperative communication, e.g., risks, explanation of disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;We characterized long utterances as those in the top 5% of character length: &gt;562 characters, roughly 108 words or 30 seconds.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;We analyzed 169 transcripts&nbsp;(median length 21 min, range 5 to 61 min). Three surgeons had only 3 transcripts appropriate for inclusion.&nbsp;Long utterances ranged from 562 to 10,322 characters (roughly 30 sec to 9.2 min). Forty-one of 43 (95%) surgeons engaged in long talk in at least one consultation and 84% used long talk in at least half of their consultations. The range of long talk was 3 to 46 utterances per surgeon and 1 to 18 utterances per transcript. There was no association between surgeon specialty or location with long talk.&nbsp;Long utterances primarily contained descriptions of the patient&rsquo;s disease and treatment and rarely included options or tradeoffs (Figure). Surgeons often covered multiple topics in their long talks (44% of long utterances covered 3 or more topics) without pause to let the patient or family contribute or ask questions. Within these long utterances,&nbsp;some surgeons used highly consistent phrasing among all patients while others broached a range of topics without recognizable patterns

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;In this multi-specialty, multi-site sample, most surgeons talk in an uninterrupted fashion at times during surgical consultation; however, the frequency of use of long talk varies between individuals. These long talks most often delivered technical information about disease and treatment. Although surgeons were engaging in information transfer, this presentation may make it difficult for patients and families to identify the salient issues related to surgical decision making.

Chang<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>Brigham And Women's Hospital,Surgery,Boston, MA, USA <sup>2</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital,Surgery,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: &nbsp;The impact of delivering high-quality care on hospital financial performance is uncertain. Some argue that higher-quality care may be too expensive and can negatively impact hospital finances and disrupt future care delivery. In contrast, advocates argue that higher-quality care ultimately leads to better clinical outcomes and improved financial health through increases in revenue and decreases in expensive complications.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;We performed an observational study of private US hospitals from 2013-2018 using quality metrics from Hospital Compare data linked with hospital characteristics from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Mixed effects linear regression was performed with fixed year effects and random hospital intercept effects. The dependent variable was total profit margin. Independent variables included the hospital&#39;s weighted average 30-day mortality rate, 30-day readmission rate, Patient Safety Indicator-90 (PSI-90) score (higher scores indicate lower quality), and hospital characteristics.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Our sample included 11,247 hospital-years from 2,427 unique hospitals. The median hospital mortality rate was 12.3% (IQR 11.3 &mdash; 13.3) and the median readmission rate was 15.3% (IQR 14.7 &mdash; 15.9). The median PSI-90 score was 0.91 (IQR 0.80 &mdash; 1.02). There was some, but not consistent, association between higher mortality rates and higher hospital profit margins. In contrast, there were significant associations between higher readmission rates and lower profit margins (highest quartile with an adjusted difference of -0.60% compared to the lowest quartile) and between higher PSI-90 scores and lower profit margins (significant for all quartiles with an adjusted difference of -0.48% for the highest quartile compared to lowest quartile, Figure).&nbsp;


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Poor hospital safety quality and higher readmission rates may contribute to worse hospital financial performance. Hospital managers and policymakers should support investments to improve hospital quality.&nbsp;

This paper aims to explore the prevalence and risk factors of global cognitive impairment and executive function impairment among adult KT candidates and recipients across the age spectrum.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;A two-center prospective cohort study (2009-2019) consisting of 5199 KT candidates and recipients was leveraged. The Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3MS) and the Trail Making Tests (TMTs) were applied at evaluation for candidates and at KT admission for recipients to measure global cognitive function and executive function respectively. The prevalence of global cognitive impairment (3MS&lt;80) and executive function impairment (TMT&gt;1.5 standard deviations above mean test time) were estimated by age. The risk factors for global cognitive impairment and executive function impairment were estimated using adjusted logistic regression. A Wald test was used to test the interactions of risk factors with age.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;The 3MS was measured among 3992 KT candidates and 1207 recipients, while TMT was measured among 2205 candidates and 327 recipients. The prevalence of global cognitive impairment increased with age among KT candidates, while the prevalence was lower among KT recipients and showed a U-shaped relationship with age; the prevalence of executive function impairment increased with age among both KT candidates and recipients (Figure 1). KT candidates and recipients who were older (&gt;=65), Hispanic, and had lower educational attainment were more likely to show cognitive impairment. Male sex, Black race, and both types of dialysis were also risk factors for cognitive impairment among candidates. The burden of executive function impairment was higher among male and Black candidates and recipients; among KT candidates, older age, lower education, hemodialysis, and diabetes were also associated with executive function impairment. No differences were observed in the strength of these associations by age group in either cohort (p for interactions&gt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The burden of cognitive impairment is high even in young KT candidates and recipients and increases with age. Transplant centers should be aware of the need of screening for cognitive impairments for kidney failure patients at all ages and be aware that younger surgical patients with kidney failure may experience a high burden of cognitive impairment.

Emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions are common and are associated with high mortality and costs. Interhospital transfers occur frequently for patients with EGS conditions. However, the network in which these transfers take place is not well understood, including the degree to which patients are systematically transferred to high-volume and high-performing hospitals. Using a network analysis approach, we examined the interhospital transfer system for EGS in the United States, focusing on the association between hospital-level factors and transfer patterns among hospitals within the transfer network.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective cohort study of episodes of care with EGS conditions that involved interhospital transfers from an emergency department (ED) to an inpatient admission at a different hospital. We used all-payer claims data from the 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient and ED Databases in eight U.S. states. We defined EGS episodes as temporally adjacent ED and inpatient encounters that occurred in different hospitals, in which the inpatient encounter had an EGS diagnosis. In our network analysis, hospitals were nodes and transfers were directional ties between nodes. We then defined 3 variables at the hospital level: in-degree centrality (the number of ties directed to the node), out-degree centrality (the number of ties directed from the node), and centrality ratio (in-degree divided by out-degree centrality; in which higher values indicate more transfers accepted in relation to transfers sent). We then performed multivariable logistic regression in which the dependent variable was log-transformed centrality ratio and the independent variables were indirect (such as hospital size, trauma center designation, teaching status, EGS volume) and direct (risk-adjusted mortality and failure to rescue) measures of hospital quality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In 2016, 728 hospitals were involved in 48,446 transfers for EGS conditions. Median (interquartile range) number of transfers sent and transfers received were 106 (60.5-157) and 35 (8-136), respectively. Median centrality ratio was 0.23 (0.02, 1.09). In multivariable analysis, a higher log-transformed centrality ratio was associated with several indirect measures of quality, including more ICU beds, teaching hospital status, trauma center designation, and higher EGS volume (p&lt;0.01). However, log-transformed centrality ratio was not associated with direct measures of quality, including risk-adjusted mortality (&beta;= 0.49; 95% CI: -9.4, 10.4; p=0.92) and failure to rescue (&beta;= -3.8; 95% CI: -10.2, 2.6; p=0.24).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The existing EGS transfer system consistently directs patients to well-resourced hospitals but does not consistently direct patients to hospitals with better clinical outcomes. Future research should identify specific opportunities for targeting transfer destinations in order to improve outcomes for transferred patients with EGS conditions.

Nationwide, Stop the Bleed (STB) courses have been offered as a means to equip learners with basic skills to control life-threatening hemorrhage. While the benefits of this program have been studied in the civilian population, less attention has been given to the outcomes of this training for first responders, particularly law enforcement officers. Our institution, an academic, Level-1 Adult &amp; Pediatric Trauma Center, partnered with the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) Academy&nbsp;in 2017 to create a novel Trauma Experience (TrEx) course to be completed by the PSP cadets. The TrEx course is a simulation based program designed to expose the cadets to a range of trauma scenarios which they may encounter during their career as as PSP troopers.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Since the inception of the TrEx course, we have trained more than 1,100 graduating PSP cadets. We designed a REDCap based questionnaire aimed at identifying perceived strengths and weaknesses in the current trauma knowledge of&nbsp;PSP troopers as well as confidence in their ability to render aid to an injured victim. This survey was distributed to all active PSP troopers and included participants who had taken the TrEx course during their academy training (TrEx) as well as those who had graduated prior to 2017 and therefore only completed the standard STB course (STB).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 4,599 active PSP troopers received the email-distributed survey with 1,506 (32.7%) responding [TrEx n=243(16%), STB n=1,263(84%)]. Troopers who participated in the TrEx course were found to have provided medical care and used a tourniquet fewer times in the field than those who did not complete the course (both p&lt;0.005). Despite having less overall real world experience, TrEx participants felt more confident in their ability to recognize scenarios in which a tourniquet should be used and in their ability to properly apply a tourniquet (both p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, the TrEx group reported less perceived need for additional education regarding appropriate tourniquet use and application (p=0.032). Cohorts did not differ in confidence in their ability to recognize life-threatening bleeding (p=0.370).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
These results demonstrate that the TrEx course created through the partnership of our Trauma Center and the Pennsylvania State Police Academy is more effective than standard STB training in increasing trooper confidence in both applying tourniquets and recognizing situations in which a tourniquet should be used. These data show that law enforcement officers should receive additional training in hemorrhage control beyond what the STB course teaches. Future initiatives should involve&nbsp;enhancing&nbsp;partnerships between trauma centers and law enforcement agencies in an effort to improve the ability and confidence of law enforcement officers to respond properly to a victim with life threatening hemorrhage.

Two scenarios involved only one trauma patient and 1 scenario involved multiple patients. Participants were ED nurses, emergency medicine and surgery residents. Each wore a heart rate sensor that detected continuous electrical heart signals, calculated interbeat intervals, and transmitted data via Bluetooth to a smart watch. Processing of raw data generated more than 40 heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. We chose the low frequency/high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio), a validated proxy for cognitive load&nbsp;and calculated it using a 1-minute time window, allowing comparison across different roles, specialties and simulation phases. A mixed model analysis with repeated measures was performed, followed by Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 10 participants (2 surgery residents, 6 EM residents, and 2 ED nurses) were monitored during 4 sessions, totaling 12 simulated scenarios. Most participants were female (N=7, 70%) and the mean age was 31.4&nbsp;+&nbsp;5.2 years. There was a statistically significant difference of LF/HF ratio between the scenario and the debriefing phases: mean difference = 1.91; 95% CI = [1.28 &ndash; 2.53]; p &lt; 0.001.&nbsp;Compared to single-patient scenarios, multiple-patient scenarios posed a higher cognitive load to learners: mean difference = 1.34; 95% CI = [0.35 &ndash; 2.32]; p = 0.008 (Fig.1).There was no statistically significant difference between leaders and followers, or between specialties.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;We used an objective digital biomarker (HRV) to measure cognitive load of learners during simulation-based TTT. Our findings revealed that cognitive load (LF/HF ratio) during simulation activities were higher than the average normal in adults (at rest). Cognitive load was also increased during all three scenarios compared to debriefings, and the highest in a multiple-patient scenario, suggesting that HRV is a sensitive tool to detect cognitive load in varying simulation phases and scenario difficulty. Future studies could use HRV to understand the relationship between cognitive load, performance and long-term skills retention.

With the expansion of minimally invasive techniques, there is a growing concern of inadequate resident exposure to conventional open operations during surgical training. This is most concerning for operations that might be performed infrequently at certain institutions but will be essential for independent practice, such as open inguinal hernia repair. We hypothesize that there has been an increased exposure to minimally invasive inguinal hernia cases with a concomitant decline in exposure to open inguinal hernia cases.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We conducted a review of publicly available Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) case reports from 2003-2018. Both open and minimally invasive inguinal hernia cases were evaluated. Analyzed data included total and average case number for open and minimally invasive inguinal hernia repairs. Descriptive statistics as well as simple linear regression analysis for the overall cohort was performed to determine the trends in surgical cases.&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

From 2003-2009, there was an overall increase in the number of inguinal hernia repairs performed (open and minimally invasive) from 62,839 to 70,139 (p=0.04). From 2003-2018, the average number of minimally invasive inguinal hernia cases per resident increased from 11.9 in 2003 to 40.1 in 2018 (p&lt;0.001). For open cases, the number of cases slightly decreased from 47.9 in 2003 to 46.3 in 2018. The slope coefficient was 1.97, meaning the number of minimally invasive operations per resident increased by an average of 1.97 per year from 2003-2018. There was no statistically significant change observed in the number of open inguinal hernia operations performed per resident from 2003-2018 (p=0.21) with simple linear regression.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Adequate exposure to a breadth of technical approaches continues to be an important topic in ACGME discussions for surgical residency. Our review has shown a national increase in the total number of inguinal hernia repairs performed and the number of minimally invasive inguinal hernia repairs performed in general surgery residency. Despite this overall increase, general surgery resident exposure to open inguinal hernia repair has remained unchanged. Future studies are needed to characterize resident and faculty perspectives on optimal training approaches in inguinal hernia repair.

Porterfield<sup>1</sup>, B. Lindeman<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham,Department Of Surgery,Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  A subset of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) have been developed for general surgery. Little evidence currently exists for their validity as a workplace-based assessment tool. In this study, we aimed to collect concurrent validity evidence for EPAs as a framework for assessment of general surgery residents compared to the current gold standard of ACGME milestones.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;All general surgery residents at a&nbsp;tertiary care center were encouraged to complete EPA micro-assessments using a mobile app. EPA ratings were collected across 3 phases of care (pre-, intra-, and post-operative) for 5 clinical scenarios immediately following a clinical encounter using a numerical scale from 0-4. Milestone evaluations (scored 0-4) were performed bi-annually to assess competency advancement. Resident PGY level and case difficulty were also collected.&nbsp;Correlation between&nbsp;EPA and milestone scores was assessed with Spearman rank correlation, and multivariable regression was utilized&nbsp;to identify significant predictors of milestone ratings.

&nbsp;

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;From August 2018-December 2019, a total of 320 micro-assessments were collected from 34 residents (70%).&nbsp;&nbsp;EPA scores demonstrated developmental increases by PGY level (Figure 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;Operative phase EPA scores were significantly lower than non-operative phase scores (2.04&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.99 vs 3.70&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.68, p,0.001). EPA scores demonstrated strong correlation with non-operative milestone ratings PC-1, MK-1, and ICS-2 (&gt;0.55 for all, p&lt;0.001) and moderate correlation with operative milestone ratings PC-3 and MK-2 (=0.41, p&lt;0.001;&nbsp;=0.31, p&lt;0.001).&nbsp;&nbsp;When EPA scores differed significantly from respective non-operative milestone ratings, EPA scores were consistently higher. On multivariable regression, PGY level (0.36, p&lt;0.001) operative phase (-1.69, p&lt;0.001) , and case difficulty (0.11, p=0.04) were significant independent predictors of faculty entrustment ratings.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;The correlation between EPA micro-assessment scores and respective milestone ratings establishes concurrent validity evidence for EPAs as a formative assessment in general surgery residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;Operative phases of care were granted consistently less entrustment than non-operative phases. Further study is needed to determine how use of EPAs can enhance entrustment decision-making to better equip general surgery residents for unsupervised practice upon graduation.

Competency-based education frameworks such as Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) may help address gender evaluation bias in surgery by linking evaluations to specific, observable behaviors. This study evaluated the gender differences in both the faculty assessments of residents and resident self-assessments across 5 EPAs in general surgery. We hypothesized that female residents would under-rate their own performance and receive lower faculty evaluations compared to male residents.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: &nbsp;Within a single academic general surgery residency program, assessment data for five surgery specific EPAs was prospectively collected using a mobile application for 23 months. Bivariate comparison between male and female residents was performed using chi-square and student&rsquo;s t-tests. The effect of gender on EPA evaluation scores was analyzed using multiple linear regression while controlling for faculty gender, PGY level, EPA type, faculty department, faculty years of experience, and phase of care.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:&nbsp;Of the 2,480 EPA&nbsp;evaluations, 1,230 were submitted by faculty and 1,250 were submitted by residents. 1,295 EPA&nbsp;evaluations were submitted for female residents and 1,185 were submitted for male residents (faculty and resident submission). Following multiple linear regression, faculty evaluations of residents were not impacted by resident gender (estimate = 0.09, p = 0.08). However, in resident self-assessments female residents underrated themselves by 0.29 (on a 0-4 scale) compared to their male counterparts (p &lt; 0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:&nbsp;Faculty assessments showed no difference in EPA scores between male and female residents. Female residents underrated themselves by nearly an entire PGY level compared to male residents. Understanding female residents&rsquo; tendency to underrate themselves has important&nbsp;implications for surgical educators.

Lussiez<sup>1</sup>, G. Kwakye<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>University of Michigan,Department Of Surgery,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

The surgical workforce is growing more diverse, but there are persistent barriers to academic surgical advancement for those underrepresented in medicine (URiM). At the same time, academic surgical departments with dedicated resident development years offer an ever-widening menu of options for career development time.

&nbsp;

Little is known about the academic interests of highly competitive general surgery applicants, including URiM applicants. With this in mind, we analyzed the academic interests of applicants selected to interview at an academic surgical program during the 2019-2020 interview cycle.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Highly competitive external applicants who were offered interviews at an academic general surgery program completed a survey on gender, race/ethnicity, and academic area of interest. Applicants expressing interest in global and community health were contacted for an explanatory semi-structured interview.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

76 applicants completed the survey with a 100% completion rate. URiM applicants, who comprised 24% of the cohort, were significantly more interested in global and community health (OR 8.63, 95% CI 2.53-29.38, p=0.001). Education and professional development was popular accross all groups. There were no differences in declared interest by gender (Table 1).

&nbsp;

Of 17 applicants who indicated an interest in global and community health, 8 completed an explanatory semi-structured interview; of these, seven were URiM. Key themes identified during the interviews included origin from an underserved international or community setting, strong interest in sustainable and mutually beneficial global partnerships, challenges in seeking out and identifying mentors in the field, and commitment to increasing diversity in surgery.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

For programs aiming to recruit top applicants into a diverse residency cohort, focusing on academic development in both global/community health and education/professional development may strengthen the pipeline of academic URiM surgeons. Fostering mentorship in the field and establishing sustainable partnerships would address important barriers to pursuing global and community health work. URiM applicants interested in global and community health also noted that joining a surgical program committed to a racially diverse surgical workforce was a high priority.

For optimal training of surgical residents, it is critical to construct an accurate, comprehensive understanding of trainee operative experience, which is approximated by surgical case logs. The ACGME implemented a competency based approach for surgical training through the Milestones project and requires residents to log surgical cases with credit only given to the primary CPT code. We sought to compare the operative experience of trainees under the current model of primary CPT codes vs. a more inclusive model with secondary CPT codes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The case logs of 218 residents and 164,692 cases (11/2008 - 7/2020) were evaluated across 39 hospitals, 9 training programs, and 7 surgical specialities. We utilized a HIPAA-compliant resident education platform (Firefly) for tracking case assignments and operative case logs. We calculated the average number of procedures logged per case, both in aggregate and grouped by program year. Procedures were counted by primary and secondary CPT codes, to measure the difference in logged procedures that were not considered for residency credit.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Capturing procedures and sub-procedures directly from the OR schedule was associated with 16% increased CPT codes per procedure (paired t-test, p &lt; 0.00001), with the largest increase for senior residents. Residents performed significantly more procedures than the current model of primary codes recognizes for major credit.

When grouped by ACGME-defined CPT area, the largest differences were observed for coronary sclerosis (51% additional CPT codes per case), peripheral obstructive cases (40%), 29%), and venous cases (26%).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

In this multi-institution, multi-specialty attempt to clarify logging practices, surgical residents logged on average 16% more procedures than credited to them in the existing ACGME case credit allocation model of one primary CPT code per patient each day. This demonstrates significant under-reporting of resident surgical experience during training. Based on several resident interviews and preliminary comparison of assigned cases vs. logged cases (data not shown), the under-reporting is significantly larger than shown by case log data. Residents often forget to log cases, or fail to log secondary procedures, any procedures that are not classified for major credit by the ACGME, and procedures beyond their ACGME minimum requirements. Surgical education is transitioning to more procedural competency-based feedback and assessment. Consideration of crediting residents for all aspects of surgical procedure completed as a part of their training may help improve characterization of the quality of the trainee operative experience.
