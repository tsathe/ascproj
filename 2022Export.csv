Inflammation is a central pathophysiological mechanism in both CRC and obesity. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the obesity-related hormones leptin and adiponectin mediate inflammation and affect tumor progression in CRC. Current evidence shows that anti-inflammatory M2-like TAMs are associated with tumor progression and worse patient prognosis in CRC. The macrophage-specific metabolite itaconate is produced by the enzyme Aconitate Decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1) in certain macrophage subtypes and is carcinogenic. The effects of obesity-related hormones and itaconate on cellular metabolism in CRC, however, are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate inflammatory responses and the role of itaconate in TAMs and colon cancer cells using an in vitro co-culture model.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: THP-1 monocyte cells were seeded into 24-well co-culture plates and polarized into M2-like macrophages within 14 days. Cells were then co-cultured with HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells and treated with either leptin, adiponectin, 4-octyl itaconate (OI) or dimethyl itaconate (DI) for 3 and 6 hours. Gene expression was analyzed using TaqMan qRT-PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student&rsquo;s t-test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In M2-like macrophages, proinflammatory IL-1&beta; expression was significantly upregulated following adiponectin (30-fold, p=0.014) and leptin treatment (6-fold, p=0.026) for 6 hours (Fig. 1A). Expression of ACOD1 in M2-like macrophages was upregulated with adiponectin treatment (50-fold, p=0.002) for 6 hours (Fig. 1B). In HT-29 cells, OI treatment resulted in decreased expression of the proinflammatory cytokine CXCL10 at 3 hours (-5 fold-regulation, p=0.045) (Fig. 1C).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Adiponectin and leptin treatment results in a proinflammatory cellular response in TAMs, while the production of the carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate is induced. Therefore, the obesity-related hormones leptin and adiponectin activate tumor promoting mechanisms in CRC. Furthermore, the itaconate derivative OI decreases proinflammatory CXCL10 expression in colon cancer cells, thereby likely enhancing mechanisms of tumor growth and metastasis. In summary, the effects of adiponectin and leptin on M2-like TAM metabolism and cytokine expression in colon cancer may provide a link between obesity, inflammation and EOCRC.","Basic Science","Immunology/Immunotherapy","Colorectal"

Galandiuk<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Price Institute of Surgical Research, Division Of Colorectal Surgery, LOUISVILLE, KY, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Louisville, School Of Medicine, Louisville, KY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), diagnosed before the age of 50, has steadily increased during the last two decades, and approximately 80% of these cancers are sporadic. Obesity is also on the rise within the United States, and a possible link between metabolic dysfunction, inflammation and EOCRC has been suggested.

Within the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are able to regulate inflammation and to produce the anti-inflammatory carcinogenic macrophage-metabolite itaconate. While anti-inflammatory mechanisms and low peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &gamma; (PPAR&gamma;) expression in CRC are associated with advanced tumor stage and progression, the effects of itaconate on cellular metabolism and cancer progression are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate carcinogenic cytokine expression and PPAR&gamma; levels in response to treatment with the macrophage-metabolite itaconate in human colon cancer cells.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cells were plated into 24-well plates and rested for 24 hours. Cells were treated with the itaconate derivatives dimethyl itaconate (DI) or 4-octyl itaconate (OI) over four different incubation periods. Cellular mRNA was harvested, and qRT-PCR was performed, comparing cytokine and transcription factor gene expression in treated cells with untreated control cells resting in cell medium only. Statistical significance was evaluated using a paired t-test and results p&lt;0.05 are displayed.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Dl downregulated expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1&beta; at 18 hours (-12-fold p=0.007) (Fig.1A). Proinflammatory CXCL10 was downregulated following DI treatment as well at 6 hours (- 3-fold p=&lt;0.001),18 hours (-10-fold p=0.001) and 24 hours (-7-fold p=0.011) (Fig. 1B), respectively, which can promote tumor development. OI downregulated the transcription factor PPAR&gamma; in HT-29 colon cancer cells significantly after 6 hours (- 4-fold p=0.009), 18 hours (-4-fold p=0.004) and 24 hours (-8-fold p=&lt;0.001) (Fig. 1C) of treatment, which is an expression pattern associated with worse outcome in CRC.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Both itaconate derivatives, DI and OI, induce anti-inflammatory and carcinogenic effects in human colon cancer cells. While DI shifts cytokine expression in colon cancer cells towards a more anti-inflammatory profile, OI directly affects expression of a prognostically relevant transcription factor in CRC. We believe that TAMs mediate cancer-promoting mechanisms through an anti-inflammatory environment and PPAR&gamma; downregulation through itaconate in human colon cancer. Macrophage metabolism and itaconate production may link metabolic dysfunction and tumor development in patients with EOCRC.

Similarly, obesity rates continue to trend up. CRC progression is affected by inflammation mediated through tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) of a largely anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype, that is associated with worse CRC prognosis.

The impact of the adipokine adiponectin on M2-like macrophages and progression in CRC is poorly understood. Anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, downregulation of the transcription factor Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor g (PPAR&gamma;) and upregulation of Nuclear factor-&kappa;B (NF-&kappa;B) are associated with advanced tumor stage and worse outcome in patients with CRC. The aim was to investigate the effects of adiponectin on tumor-promoting cytokines, transcription factors, and cell surface markers following adiponectin treatment in M2-like macrophages.



<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: THP-1 cells were seeded onto culture plates and polarized into a distinct M2-like macrophage phenotype within 14 days. Cells were then treated with adiponectin for either 3, 6, 18, or 24 hours. mRNA was extracted and qRT-PCR was performed. Cytokine gene expression was measured relative to untreated control cells. For statistical analysis, paired t-tests were used.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Following adiponectin treatment, M2-like macrophages showed a peak upregulation of the anti-inflammatory tumor-promoting cytokines C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 22 (CCL22) after 24 hours (42-fold, p=0.002) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) after 18 hours (683-fold, p=&lt;0.001), while IL-10 expression was maximally downregulated after 24 hours (- 9-fold, p=&lt;0.001) (Fig. 1B). Peak upregulation of the tumor-promoting proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 (1130-fold, p=0.001) and IL-1b (485-fold, p=&lt;0.001) was reached after 6 hours of adiponectin treatment, respectively (Fig. 1A). Expression of the M1-like macrophage surface marker CD80 was maximally increased after 6 hours (52-fold, p=0.003), while expression of the M2-like marker CD206 showed the lowest decrease at 24 hours (- 30-fold, p=&lt;0.001) (Fig. 1C). NF-&kappa;B expression was increased at all time points with a peak at 6 hours (20-fold, p=&lt;0.001) (Fig. 1D). We observed no significant change in expression of PPAR&gamma; or anti-inflammatory CCL18.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Adiponectin promotes expression of cancer-related cytokines and NF-&kappa;B in M2-like macrophages, thereby triggering cancer progression in CRC. Upregulation of the M1-like cell surface marker CD80 following adiponectin treatment shows that a phenotypic change of macrophages towards an M1-like proinflammatory phenotype is induced. Adiponectin may be an important a link between obesity, inflammation and EOCRC.

Galandiuk<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Louisville, Price Institute Of Surgical Research, Louisville, KY, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Kentucky, Gluck Equine Research Center, Lexington, KY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant syndrome defined by APC gene mutations with numerous colonic adenomas developing early in life. Cancer risk is nearly 100% for FAP patients without intervention. The APC gene on chromosome 5q22 encodes a protein regulating Wnt signaling, ultimately functioning as a tumor suppressor.

Conversely, Crohn&rsquo;s disease (CD) an inflammatory bowel disease with mechanisms not completely defined, is characterized by chronic inflammation and/or fibrostenotic strictures within the gastrointestinal tract. CD etiology is multifactorial; many genetic loci have been associated with CD and some (IBD5) are also on chromosome 5q.

We have identified a unique group of individuals with both disorders and hypothesize that there is an association between FAP and CD given the geographic proximity of IBD5 and APC on Chromosome 5.

We aim to:

1)assess the prevalence of previously identified cases of coexisting FAP and CD in the literature.

2)perform next generation sequencing (NGS) in dually diagnosed patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 1)We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA). The PubMed, Embase, Ovid and Web of Science databases, dates from January 1950 to July 2020 were searched. A Google Scholar search was also performed. A search of grey literature was performed including Digestive Disease Week archives from 1974-2020. Relevant datapoints were extracted for descriptive analysis.

2)Whole blood was obtained from 8 patients with both FAP &amp; CD after obtaining informed consent. NGS was performed, reads produced were mapped to the human reference genome build 38 at an average depth of coverage of 20X with paired end 150 base read length.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Initial search yielded 1,214 articles. Inclusion criteria included full-text articles presenting coexisting/sequential cases of both FAP and CD. After titles and abstract screening, 1,120 articles were excluded with 94 selected for full text assessment; 12 were selected for systematic review, each describing patients with FAP and CD.

In our institution, we identified 4 cases of FAP associated with CD. NGS analysis showed each of these patients who are phenotypically similar to share the same genetic mutation; an 11 KB deletion in promoter 1B of the APC gene.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A systematic literature review yielded an additional 8 cases phenotypically similar to ours. Some articles include a comprehensive description of genetic data with little phenotypic detail. Conversely, other articles are clinical reports, without a genetic analysis. We have confirmed an 11KB APC promoter deletion in individuals with coexisting FAP and Crohn&rsquo;s disease. Due to the infrequency of this mutation, and the co-occurrence of these conditions, further study may provide additional information regarding the etiology of Crohn&rsquo;s disease in these patients.

Traditionally, rectal cancer is treated with chemotherapy, radiation, followed by surgery but response to this treatment is variable. ST6Gal-1 is an enzyme that adds sialic acid (SA) to cell surface proteins and can modify function. Our previous studies have shown that ST6Gal-1 mediates resistance in rectal cancer cell lines, although the mechanism is poorly understood. We hypothesized that ST6Gal-1 increases following chemoradiation in primary rectal cancer organoids similar to what we have found in cell lines and that the mechanism of resistance is via decreased apoptosis. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We assessed ST6Gal-1 in treated rectal cancer organoids made from patient tumor biopsies using fluorescent staining and PCR. SW620 cells were transduced with lentivirus containing shST6Gal-1 to knockdown the mRNA (KD) or an shRNA control vector (CV). Flow cytometry was used to assess Annexin V as a measure of apoptosis. SNA is a lectin which recognizes sialic acid placed on proteins by ST6Gal-1. An SNA Lectin pulldown was performed, and western blotting was used to assess for TNFR1 antibody.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We treated primary rectal cancer with chemoradiation and assessed for ST6GaL-1. We found that ST6Gal-1 protein increased via immunofluorescent staining and PCR revealed a 3-fold increase in ST6Gal-1 mRNA on day 5 (N=3, p=0.007). To further explore mechanism, flow cytometry was performed in SW 620 rectal cancer cells following chemoradiation and identified 33.3% apoptotic cells in the KD group compared to 18.66% in CV cells containing ST6Gal-1. TNFR1, which has previously been shown to be sialylated, was also explored as a potential target. Cells underwent SNA lectin pulldown to collect sialylated proteins and found sialylated TNFR1 increased 2.91-fold in treated CV samples compared to untreated but this difference was not seen in KD samples.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We have shown that ST6Gal-1 is increased in cell lines and rectal cancer organoids after chemoradiation, and that apoptosis is likely one mechanism mediating this resistance via TNFR1 sialylation.

Our lab has shown a significant role for IL-10 overexpression in regulating inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) production, thereby attenuating fibrosis in skin wounds. However, the role of IL-10 in wound closure is unclear, as previous studies in murine wounds, not controlled for contraction and moist wound environment, have shown increased rates of wound closure in IL-10-/- mice. The objective of this study is to determine the role of endogenous IL-10 on wound closure when controlling for contraction and a moist wound environment.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Full thickness 6mm wounds were made in C57B6/J WT and IL-10-/- mice and controlled for contraction using a silicone stent. A moist wound environment was provided by Tegaderm dressing. Wounds were serially photographed at 3, 5 and 7d, harvested at 7d and 30d post wounding, then examined for epithelial gap, granulation tissue, scar area(H&amp;E), myofibroblasts(aSMA), and leukocyte(CD45) and macrophage content(F4/80). Data is mean+-SD, n=8-10 wounds/group/time; p-value by ANOVA.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

In contrast to prior reports, unstented IL-10-/- wounds maintained in a moist wound environment showed no significant difference in epithelial gap at d7, but had an increase in granulation tissue (IL-10-/- 1.4+-0.6 vs WT 0.8+-0.4 mm<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;0.01) compared to WT. Unstented IL-10-/- wounds exhibited a heightened inflammatory response, with an elevated % of CD45+ (IL-10-/- 28.9%+-14.1 vs WT 6.0+-2.7, p&lt;.01) and F4/80+ (IL-10-/- 53.7%+-1.2 vs WT 28.3+-0.5, p&lt;.01) cells/high power field(HPF). Upon stenting the wounds, no difference in epithelial gap and granulation tissue was seen. The increase in % of F4/80+ cells/HPF (IL-10-/- 21.3%+-3.6 vs WT 22.4+-5.4, p&lt;.05) persisted in stented wounds. There was a marked increase in the % of CD45+ cells/HPF (IL-10-/-22.4%+-1.5 vs WT 13.6%+-1.7, p=ns) as well. aSMA showed abundant expression at the wound margins in all wounds, but stented wounds had more aSMA present in the granulation tissue compared to unstented wounds. IL-10-/- wounds had more aSMA staining in the wound bed than WT. However, analysis of the % of aSMA + cells/HPF showed no significant difference in the stented and unstented wounds. At d30, wounds in IL-10-/- mice had significantly larger scar area as compared WT in stented (IL-10-/- 0.24+-0.02 vs WT 0.17+-0.06 mm<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;.05) and unstented (IL-10-/- 0.18+-0.01 vs WT 0.13+-0.03 mm<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;.05) groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our data showed endogenous IL-10 does not delay normal healing of skin wounds when controlled for contraction and moist environment. However, the loss of IL-10 leads to increased inflammation and fibrosis. This data signifies a previously unrecognized role for endogenously expressed IL-10 contributing to the tissue repair response.

Silo inaccessibility contributes to this extreme disparity, as standard of care (SOC) silos cost $280, and most median family incomes in sub-Saharan Africa are &lt;$200 per month. Our team of surgeons, engineers, and neonatologists from the U.S. and Uganda have previously described design and bench-testing of a low-cost (LC) silo that costs &lt;$5 and is constructed from a urine collection bag and female condom ring, which are locally available in sub-Saharan Africa. Here we describe in vivo testing of the LC silos.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A piglet model of gastroschisis was achieved by eviscerating the intestines through a 2cm midline abdominal wall incision. The bowel was placed into either a LC or SOC silo, maintained for one hour and then reduced. Procedure times for placement, intestinal reduction and silo removal were recorded. Tissue injury was assessed by protocol-blinded histological examination of the abdominal wall and intestine. Quantitative assessment of bacterial and fungal growth on the silos were performed using standard culture techniques. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test (alpha=0.05).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Six piglets (2.0-2.6 Kg) were block randomized to LC (n=3) or SOC (n=3) silo application. There was no visible gross injury to abdominal wall or intestine specimens in either the LC or SOC silos. Concurrently, there was no difference in minor bleeding (bruising) between the LC and SOC silos (Table 1). The differences in silo application times (LC 42 &plusmn; 48 seconds; SOC 47 &plusmn; 18 seconds; p=1.0), bowel reduction times (LC 6 &plusmn; 3.5 seconds, SOC 1 &plusmn; 2 seconds; p=0.40) and silo removal times (LC 2 &plusmn; 0.5 seconds, SOC 3 &plusmn; 1.5 second; p=0.40) between groups were not statistically or clinically significant, indicating similar ease of use. Microbiology analysis revealed bacterial growth on all samples, but the bacterial density was below the standard inoculum in vitro acceptability of 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/g for both the LC and SOC silos (Fig 1). There was no statistically significant difference in bacterial or fungal growth between the LC and SOC silos (anaerobic p=0.34; aerobic p=0.06; fungal p=0.80).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A low-cost silo, designed for manufacturing and clinical use in sub-Saharan Africa, demonstrated similar ease of use, absence of tissue injury, and acceptable microbiology profile similar to SOC silos.

On top of increasing costs, inefficient utilization of operating theaters results in prolonged waiting lists, high rate of cancellation, frustration of OT personnel as well as increased anxiety that negatively impacts the health of patients. This problem is magnified in developing countries, where there is a high unmet surgical need. However, no system currently exists to assess operating theatre utilization in Ethiopia.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A prospective study was conducted over a period of 2 months (May-June 2018) at our hospital. It is the largest hospital in the country and has the highest number of operating theaters. Surgical case start time, end time, room turnover time, cancellations and reason for cancellation were observed to evaluate the efficiency of eight operating theaters.

 <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 933 elective procedures were scheduled during the study period. Of these, 246 were cancelled, yielding a cancellation rate of 35.8%. The most common reasons for cancellation were related to patient preparation (29.2%) and shortage of time (32.1%). Lack of facilities accounted for 29.3% of cancellations. Start time was delayed in 93.4% of cases (mean 8:56 am + 52 min). First case completion time was early in 47.9 % and delayed in 20.6% (mean 2:54pm + 156min). Turnover time was prolonged in 34.5% (mean 25 min + 49 min). Total operating theater utilization ranged from 10.5% to 174%. Operating theaters were underutilized in 42.7% while overutilization was found in 14.6%. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We found a high cancellation rate, most of which are avoidable. The most common reason was shortage of time which could be associated with overbooking or inappropriate use of time due to other delays. Turnover time was longer than average, however, intervention in this area would likely not make an impact on efficiency as number of procedures per OT each day is low. Other measured causes of poor efficiency included late start of the first case and variable (very early or late) end of the last case. We recommend future quality improvement projects focusing on these two areas to increase OT efficiency.

Cockrell<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Vermont College Of Medicine / Fletcher Allen Health Care, Surgery, Burlington, VT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The natural history of volumetric muscle loss (VML), such as wounds of the type suffered from significant blast-injury, is healing via scar formation. The functional recovery of patients with VML would be greatly enhanced if the VML could be replaced with functional muscle instead of scar. We have performed simulation experiments with an agent-based model of VML that have suggested a crucial tipping point in terms of scar formation versus muscle regrowth that is heavily influenced by the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. A review of the literature suggested an important role for &alpha;-smooth muscle actin (&alpha;-SMA) in the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and this prompted an in silico examination of the effect of inhibition of &alpha;-SMA accumulation on the ability to increase the muscle composition of a VML.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We have developed a mechanism-based agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the temporal evolution of a volumetric muscle loss (VML). Cells represented in the ABM include satellite stem cells, myoblasts, fibroblasts, and immune cell subtypes. Machine-learning techniques are used to develop a set of model parameterizations which encompass the biological heterogeneity seen clinically. Simulation experiments were performed that used Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to incorporate the effects of inhibiting &alpha;-SMA accumulation along with other immunomodulatory controls to steer the system to maximize muscle in the healed wound.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The DRL algorithm discovered treatment policies which increased the amount of functional muscle regenerated from 2% (in the untreated case) to 80% (when AI-controlled). The discovered therapeutic policy was complex, but upon examination, two primary objectives could be inferred: 1) control of inflammation such that muscle regeneration is not impaired, and 2) sufficient interruption of the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts by inhibition of &alpha;-SMA accumulation, thus interrupting the conversion of granulation tissue to fibrotic scar.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this work, we provide an in silico proof-of-concept study that demonstrates the importance of appropriate suppression of myofibroblast transformation in order to increase final wound muscle composition, and the need for a multi-modal intervention policy to accomplish this goal. These findings are a further demonstration of the utility of an integrated workflow that uses high-fidelity mechanism-based simulation with advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence to discover potential control strategies for complex pathophysiological processes.

Impaired wound healing and scar formation have far-reaching socioeconomic effects. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause oxidative stress in the wounds and delay healing by hampering vascularization and promoting inflammatory macrophage and myofibroblast differentiation resulting in increased inflammation and scarring. Engineered biomaterials capable of scavenging ROS and facilitating controlled release of oxygen can circumvent the challenge of oxygen diffusion in situ to promote cell infiltration and survival, which is not achieved with current biomaterials. We hypothesize that the application of novel lignin (an antioxidant from lignocellulose)-based composites with ROS-scavenging and oxygen-releasing properties will enhance neovascularization and attenuate inflammation to promote wound healing.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We photo-crosslinked thiolated lignosulfonate (TLS) in methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) via thiol-ene chemoselective ligation. We developed calcium peroxide (CPO)-incorporated lignosulfonate/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microparticles, where the dissociation of CPO into oxygen is facilitated by lignosulfonate, and added CPO particles to the GelMA-TLS composites and tested its antioxidant capacity (DPPH assay) and oxygen release (pseudo 1<sup>st</sup> order model). Full thickness 6mm wounds were made in C57BL/6N mice using silicone stents to control for contraction and divided into 4 groups: Untreated (UNTX), GelMA-TLS (TLS), GelMA-TLS with carriers but no oxygen release capacity (CPOc), and GelMA-TLS with carriers+oxygen release (CPO). Wounds were harvested at 7d and examined for epithelial gap, granulation tissue (H&amp;E), myofibroblasts (&alpha;SMA), endothelial cells and vessels (CD31), and macrophages (CD206). Data presented as mean+-SD, n=3-6 wounds/group; p-value by ANOVA.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Morphometric wound analysis showed small differences in epithelial gap; however, treated wounds had greater granulating tissue area with marked increase in CPO (UNTX 1.9+-0.9 mm<sup>2</sup> vs TLS 1.9+-0.8 vs CPOc 1.7+-0.4 vs CPO 1.5+-0.4, p&lt;0.05). Notably, the CPO matrix was completely infiltrated and fully integrated with a granulating wound bed, unlike other groups which showed areas of non-infiltrated gel. CPO wounds had greater concentrations of &alpha;SMA in the middle of wound beds (UNTX 16.6+-8.7 % vs TLS 10.5+-8.7 vs CPOc 8.8+-2.4 vs CPO 17.5+-9.7, p=ns). Both CPOc and CPO wounds had greater vessel density (UNTX 14.0+4.7 lumens/40x field vs TLS 18.9+-3.9 vs CPOc 27.9+-7.2 vs CPO 25.2+-7.6, p&lt;0.05). The CPOc and CPO wounds had fewer macrophages (UNTX 32.7+-12.4 % cells/40 field vs TLS 24.9+-14.3 vs CPOc 14.6+-4.4 vs CPO 19.3+-5.5, p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our data demonstrates that the synergistic antioxidation and oxygen production capacity of lignin composites improved wound healing associated with reduced inflammation and enhanced neovascularization, representing new potential therapeutics for attenuating fibrosis and improving wound healing with engineered biomaterials.

Keswani<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine, Department Of Surgery, Houston, TX, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Texas Children's Hospital, Laboratory For Regenerative Tissue Repair, Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Women have begun to represent more of the surgical workforce, symbolizing continued success in promoting diversity, equality, and inclusion. Surgeons appointed to editorial boards, especially those of the main surgical journals, generally hold a moniker of high academic success in surgery. However, our prior data showed that there is a bias towards male editors in predominantly surgical journals. In this study, we sought to examine the degree of gender equality between different surgical subspecialties on the editorial boards of the major surgical journals.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Surgical journals obtained from the Clairvate Web of Science Group Master Journals List were examined for editorial board composition. The surgical journal websites and faculty biography pages were used to determine the gender and educational background for each North American-based member of the editorial board, as well as the gender, educational background, and current academic title for each editor-in-chief. Individuals were further grouped by surgical subspecialty field. Statistical analysis was performed via t-tests and Chi-Square tests; significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The composition of editorial boards based on gender was determined for 67 surgical specialty journals with impact factors ranging from 0.4 to 10.6. 2980 editorial board members were identified, with 593 (19%) female members and 2387 (81%) male members. When considering senior editorial board positions, only 9% of the 78 chief editors identified were female. The ratio of female members also varied by specialty - there was a significantly higher number of female senior editors in the non-surgical specialties (36%) compared to surgical specialties (13%, p&lt;0.01). The top 4 surgical subspecialties to represent women on senior editorial boards were transplant surgery (20% female), general surgery (16%), otolaryngology/plastic surgery/ophthalmology (12%), and orthopedic surgery (10%). Furthermore, some fields had a higher number of female chief editors compared to the other subspecialties. For example, general surgery had the highest number of female chief editors (3), followed by surgical oncology (2) and cardiovascular surgery and transplant surgery (1). Interestingly, the average journal impact factor of female editors was higher than that of males (3.88 vs 2.88, respectively, p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our analysis of the editorial board composition of surgical journals suggests there is variability in achieving gender equality amongst different surgical subspecialties and confirmed an overall bias towards male editors. Gender representation successes in non-surgical subspecialties and general surgery can be used to address equality issues in editorial leadership and shape a more diverse pool of surgeon scientists.

We sought to examine the effect of extended spectrum (ES) versus narrow spectrum (NS) antibiotics on postoperative outcomes in patients with CBD stones undergoing same admission cholecystectomy. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a post-hoc analysis of a prospective, observational, multicenter study of patients undergoing same admission cholecystectomy for choledocholithiasis (CDL) and/or gallstone pancreatitis (GSP) between 2016 and 2019. We excluded patient with cholangitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and/or urinary tract infections on admission; patients with perforated cholecystitis intraoperatively were also excluded. For both the pre- and postoperative periods, patients were divided into groups based on receipt of ES or NS antibiotics. Primary outcomes included surgical site infection (SSI) and/or severe sepsis. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay (HLOS) and acute kidney injury (AKI). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 891 patients in the cohort; 49.9% (n=445) patients preoperatively and 21.2% (n=189) patients postoperatively received ES antibiotics. Patients receiving NS antibiotics during the preoperative period had significantly lower white blood cell counts on admission (8.7K vs 9.9K, p&lt;.0001). There was no difference between groups regarding rates of SSI or sepsis in both the pre- and postoperative periods. However, patients receiving ES antibiotics postoperatively (5d vs 4d, p=0.002) had a longer HLOS. Rates of AKI were significantly higher for patients who received ES antibiotics in the preoperative (4.7% vs 2.0%, p=0.03) and postoperative (5.4% vs 0%, p=0.01) periods. For patients who received ES antibiotics during both the pre- and postoperative periods, the odds of AKI (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.3, p=0.02) was significantly greater compared to NS antibiotics.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The incidence of SSI and severe sepsis were similar between patients treated with ES and NS antibiotics. However, the use of ES antibiotics was associated with a significantly longer HLOS and more than twice the risk of AKI. We caution the regular use of ES antibiotics in this patient population; however, randomized trials are needed to validate our findings.

Efficient physician-patient communication is essential to providing high-quality healthcare and improving patient satisfaction. Patients admitted to the hospital from the Emergency Department may not understand their diagnosis, reason for admission or plan of care, which can adversely impact their hospital experience and in turn reflect poorly in the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores. We aim to identify risk factors that contribute to poor patient-physician communication. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: From November 2020 to April 2021, patients admitted to the surgical floor were surveyed within 24 hours of admission. They were surveyed by either a Registered Nurse, Research Assistant, or Surgical Resident. They were asked &ldquo;Do you know why you are in the hospital?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do you know what your diagnosis is?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do you understand your diagnosis?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do you know what your treatment plan is?&rdquo; A chart review was then performed recording patient demographics, preferred language, time of admission, health insurance, dependence in activities of daily living, dwelling, hearing impairment, pain level at time of admission, and number of chronic medical problems. Patients were excluded if they were &lt; 18 years of age, had a history of neurocognitive disorders, had altered mental status defined as GCS &lt; 15, required admission to the Intensive Care Unit or Step-Down Unit. Residents and attendings were debriefed regarding improving physician-patient communication at the end of January 2021 in order to raise awareness of the issue. Surveys answered before and after the brief intervention were compared.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 131 patients that were admitted to the surgical floor were surveyed. Nineteen did not know their diagnoses (14%), 29 could not explain their diagnoses (22%), and 28 did not know their treatment plans (21%). A total of 29% of patients answered &ldquo;no&rdquo; to at least one question. Trauma patients (p = 0.027), patients with pain score &gt; 4 at time of admission (p = 0.035), age &gt; 65 (p = 0.044), and patients with &gt;3 comorbidities (p = 0.035) were more likely to answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; to at least one of the questions. Limited English proficiency, insurance status, gender, and time of admission were not statistically significant barriers to effective communication. After raising awareness regarding improving physician-patient communication, we saw an 11% reduction in number of patients answering &ldquo;no&rdquo; to 24% from 35%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Trauma patients, patients with poor pain control, the elderly and those with multiple comorbidities are more likely to experience poor patient-physician communication. Additionally, we found that raising awareness of the importance of this matter resulted in an improvement in communication.

Roth<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Kentucky, College Of Medicine, Lexington, KY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Previous research has shown nearly 1 in 2 ventral and incisional hernia repair (VIHR) patients have preoperative opioid use within a year before procedure. Development of new persistent opioid use after surgery is a valid concern, and the influence of preoperative opioid dose is not well known. The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of preoperative opioid dose on postoperative opioid dose in a VIHR population. 



<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

With IRB approval, a retrospective review of patient medical records was conducted on open VIHR consecutive cases (CPT codes: 49560, 49561, 49565, 49566) performed from August 2013 to July 2017 at a single institution. Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER) database was queried to obtain both preoperative and postoperative opioid use, dose, and prescription length. Preoperative opioid use was defined utilizing the CDC standard of any opioid use within 45 days prior to surgery, but data up to 90 days pre-admission and post-discharge was also analyzed. Morphine milligram equivalent (MME) was used for uniform comparison of dose among different prescriptions. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There were 235 patients who underwent VIHR during 2013 to 2017, and among them, 205 patients had KASPER record to extract opioid utilization data. Average age was 53.5 &plusmn; SD 12.0, and 50.7% were female. Over 35% met the criteria for preoperative opioid use, and the average MME level of 45 days in that group was 13.9 MME (90 day 14.1 MME). Among all patients, the postoperative 14-day opioid MME level was 693 (Opioid users 937, Opioid na&iuml;ve 558, p &lt; .001). Average 45-day MME of preoperative opioid correlated strongly with average 45-day MME of postoperative opioid use in patients who had mean &ge; 15 preoperative MME (r = .48, p&lt; .001) but there was no correlation in patients with mean preop MME &lt; 15 (r = .05, p = .643). 90-day MME of preoperative opioid also correlated significantly with 90-day postoperative MME (r = .673, p &lt;.001). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Preoperative opioid dose over both 45 and 90 days correlated strongly with postoperative opioid dose over the same timeframes for higher preoperative MME VIHR patients. Patients with average &ge; 15 MME 45-day preoperative opioid were likely to continue use at a similar level postoperatively, while lower MME patients were more arbitrary in their postoperative use. Further research exploring the indications of preoperative opioid use and its impact on postoperative opioid use in VIHR patients is needed.

Poulose<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Department Of Surgery, Columbus, OHIO, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Weill Cornell Medical College, Department Of Population Health Sciences, New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The rates of chronic groin pain (CGP) after open inguinal hernia repair are reported between 18-51%. Previous literature has implicated nerve damage to be a significant factor and has increased awareness of proper nerve identification. However, the relative contribution of nerve management to CGP continues to emerge. Recent guidelines emphasize three-nerve recognition and handling (particularly iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal and genital branches of genitofemoral nerves) to minimize CGP. We sought to identify whether a strategy of three nerve identification (3N) and preservation results in decreased pain 6 months after open anterior inguinal hernia repair compared to two common strategies of nerve management: ilioinguinal nerve identification alone (1N) or two nerve identification (2N).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We identified adult patients undergoing elective open anterior repair of unilateral inguinal hernias within the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative (ACHQC). Six-month postoperative pain was defined using the pain domain of the EuraHS Quality of Life tool (range 0-30 with higher values indicating higher pain). A proportional odds model was used to estimate odds ratios and expected mean differences in 6 month pain for nerve management while adjusting for the logit of propensity score, baseline EuraHS pain score, and baseline confounders identified a-priori. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Between 2017-2021, 4451 patients were identified (358 (3N), 1731 (1N) and 2362 (2N) consisting mostly of White Non-Hispanic males (84%) over the age of 60, followed by African American males (8%) for both 3N and 1N groups and Hispanic males (9%) for 2N. The mean body mass index for each group was 26kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Academic centers identified all three nerves more often than ilioinguinal or two nerve identification methods. Median 6-month postoperative pain scores were 0 [IQR 0-2] for all nerve management groups (p = 0.51 3N vs 1N and 3N vs 2N). There was no evidence of a difference in the odds of higher 6 month pain scores in nerve management methods after adjustment (3N vs 1N OR: 0.95; 95% CI 0.36-1.95, 3N vs 2N OR: 1.00; 95% CI 0.50-1.85).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While guidelines emphasize three nerve identification and preservation, the three nerve management strategies evaluated did not result in statistically significant differences in pain 6 months after operation. These findings suggest that nerve manipulation alone may not contribute as significant a role in CGP after open inguinal hernia repair compared to other factors.

However, social media sources vary in quality and accuracy of patient information. Thus, utilization of social media may lead to misinformation regarding treatment for patients in need of emergent general surgery procedures.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: YouTube was searched with keywords &ldquo;cholecystectomy,&rdquo; &ldquo;cholecystitis,&rdquo; and &ldquo;gallbladder surgery&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;appendectomy,&rdquo; &ldquo;appendicitis&rdquo; and &ldquo;appendix surgery.&rdquo; For each general surgical procedure, the 100 videos with the greatest total views were chosen for review. Videos were assessed by four surgical trainees using two validated instruments: DISCERN, a measurement of the quality of health information, and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT), a measurement of understandability and actionability of patient education materials. A Likert scale was used to estimate the amount of patient education and misinformation. Chi-square test was used, and statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The average number of views was 476,073 (93,670 to 7,976,292). The mean DISCERN score was 29.3 out of 75. The mean PEMAT scores were 64% for understandability and 22% for actionability. 49% of videos were rated as providing no patient education, while 29% provided some education and 22% provided a moderate level or more patient education. 35% of videos contained misinformation. The amount of misinformation was associated with type of video publisher; videos published by doctors, medical education and healthcare systems contained less misinformation, whereas videos published by patients, health/wellness groups contained more misinformation (p&lt;0.001). Use of medical search terms &ldquo;cholecystectomy&rdquo; and &ldquo;appendectomy&rdquo; were associated with less misinformation (p&lt;0.001, p=0.021). For counterpart colloquial searches, &ldquo;gallbladder surgery&rdquo; was associated with greater misinformation (p=0.001), whereas &ldquo;appendix surgery&rdquo; was not associated with misinformation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: There is a wide range of video quality that patients may use as resource for surgical information, with most videos being poor quality and providing little patient education. Although previous studies have shown that medical misinformation within social media exists, this study is the first to classify the scope of misinformation and quality of patient education related to emergency general surgery procedures. Understanding information available to patients online can help tailor surgeon-patient discussions to combat misinformation and improve the informed consent process for patients.

The Modified 5-point Frailty Index (mFI) has been incorporated in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) datasets as a means of identifying this condition in surgical patients. As frailty and colonic diverticular disease are both associated with advancing age, the study aimed to characterize the association of mFI score with clinical outcomes following colonic resections for diverticular disease.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Adults (&ge;18 years) undergoing elective colon resection for diverticular disease were identified using the 2017-2019 NSQIP data reports. Subjects were assigned a point for each select comorbidity and grouped into 3 cohorts (mFI: 0, 1, &gt;1). Prolonged length of stay (LOS) was defined as hospitalization longer than 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for the entire group. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine the association of frailty with perioperative complications, unplanned reoperation, prolonged LOS, and 30-day readmissions.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Among 22,675 surgical patients with diverticular disease who met study criteria, 47% were in the mFI-1 and 1% in the mFI&gt;1 group. Subjects with a mFI&ge;1 less frequently underwent laparoscopic vs open resection (75 vs 80%, p&lt;0.001) and more likely to undergo colonic resection with stoma formation (7.1% vs 4.7%, p&lt;0.001) compared to the mFI-0 group. Despite these differences, the operative times were similar among the mFI-0 and mFI&ge;1 groups (201&plusmn;86 vs 191&plusmn;81 minutes, p&lt;0.001). After adjustment, frailty was associated with increased odds of perioperative complications and unplanned reoperation (Figure). With mFI-0 as reference, with each increase in mFI score groups, the odds for a prolonged LOS after the operation increased in a stepwise fashion (AOR 1.25 and 3.55, p&lt;0.01) as did 30-day readmissions (AOR 1.26 and 1.74, p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

With nearly half of patients undergoing colonic resections for diverticulitis carrying frailty defining comorbidities, this condition is associated with increased risk of complications, prolonged index hospitalization and 30-day readmissions. Preoperative assessment of frailty using the mFI may improve shared decision making and focus quality improvement efforts on this vulnerable cohort.

However, its impact on outcomes following groin hernia repair has yet to be studied in a contemporary, national cohort. The present study aimed to assess the association of malnutrition with postoperative outcomes and resource use following groin hernia repair.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adults (&ge; 18 years) undergoing inguinal or femoral hernia repair (open and laparoscopic) were identified using the 2006-2019 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database. Patients with no recorded preoperative serum albumin were excluded. Malnutrition was defined as a preoperative albumin level &lt; 3.5 g/dL. Multivariable regression models were developed to assess the association of malnutrition with outcomes of interest including 30-day mortality, complications (infectious, respiratory, and thrombotic), reoperation, postoperative length of stay (LOS), and readmission.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 106,555 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 8,002 (7.5%) were malnourished. Compared to others, malnourished patients were older (54.1 vs. 48.0 years, p&lt;0.001), more commonly female (11.7% vs. 9.3%, p&lt;0.001), and more frequently underwent an emergency (12.7% vs. 2.5%, p&lt;0.001) or open procedure (82.5% vs. 66.6%, p&lt;0.001). After risk adjustment, malnutrition was associated with greater odds of 30-day mortality (AOR 2.94, 95% CI: 2.30-3.77), infectious (AOR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.46-2.01), respiratory (AOR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.55-2.76), and thrombotic complications (AOR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.18-2.52). Additionally, malnutrition was associated with greater odds of readmission (AOR 1.79, 95% CI: 1.58-2.03) and increased LOS (&beta;: +0.4 day, 95% CI: 0.3-0.4). Decreasing serum albumin levels were associated with increased probability of mortality for both open and laparoscopic hernia repairs, with significantly increased mortality at an albumin &le; 3.5 (Figure).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Decreased preoperative serum albumin is associated with increased mortality and morbidity following open and laparoscopic groin hernia repair. Serum albumin remains a relevant predictor of postsurgical outcomes and can thus be used in counseling and shared decision making with malnourished patients in need of groin hernia repair.

Godat<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Diego, Division Of Trauma, Surgical Critical Care, Burns And Acute Care Surgery - Department Of Surgery, San Diego, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Surgical patients with acute and critical illness have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Trauma patients have high rates of VTE (7-9%) and are started on aggressive prophylaxis with twice daily enoxaparin administration and weight-based dosing; however, the optimal pharmacologic prophylaxis regimen in the emergency general surgery (EGS) patient has not been clearly defined. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis (NF) represent a group of EGS patients who typically present with severe illness associated with tissue injury and a heightened inflammatory state putting them at high risk for VTE. A better understanding of VTE risk for patients with NF is needed to guide clinical care. We hypothesize that the rates of VTE in patients admitted with NF will be high.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of the National Inpatient Sample database for the years 2017 &amp; 2018 was performed for all patients &gt;18 years old and admitted with an ICD10 diagnosis code for NF. Each admission was assessed VTE based on ICD10 codes for acute deep vein thrombosis and/or acute pulmonary embolism (PE). In addition, all patients were analyzed for surgical excision during hospitalization based on the ICD10 procedure codes for excision of skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or fascia; those who didn&rsquo;t have surgical excision were excluded from the analysis. For each patient we also obtained their age, sex, race, length of stay (LOS), insurance payer, hospital type, and mortality.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 5168 patients admitted over the 2-year period with a diagnosis of NF. Of these patients 3280 (63.5%) were treated with surgical excision. For patients with NF treated with surgical excision, the mean age was 50.314.1 and 42.3% were female. 

The overall VTE rate for patients treated with surgical excision was 3.1%; while 21.8% of these were an acute PE. In patients with VTE the LOS was significantly longer with a mean of 28.8 days (95%CI 24.0-33.7days) and in those without VTE 13.8 days (95%CI 13.3-14.3 days), p&lt;0.001. The overall mortality rate for NF patients who underwent surgery was 13.5%; those with VTE had a significantly higher mortality rate at 30.7% (p&lt;0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Though the rate of VTE in patients with NF was low, the associated risk of PE and mortality was unexpectedly high. Further investigations with expanded clinical data are needed to better understand the risk of VTE in patients with NF. Close attention should be paid to ensuring timely VTE prophylaxis is administered, and high intensity regimens should be considered in these high-risk patients.

Augenstein<sup>1</sup>, B. Heniford<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Carolinas Medical Center, GI & Minimally Invasive Surgery, Charlotte, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
ENT during adhesiolysis or SBR introduces contamination which may increase the risk of perioperative complications and thus hospital readmission. Given the cost and that readmission has become a significant quality metric, the aim was to evaluate nationwide patterns and outcomes of readmissions for patients who had an ENT or SBR during open ventral hernia repair (OVHR).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried between 2016-2018 for those with ICD-10-CM diagnostic code for ventral hernia and ICD-10-PCS procedure code for OVHR. Respective comparison groups were created using ICD-10 codes for ENT or SBR.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Over 3 years, 105,845 patients were admitted for OVHR. ENT occurred in 1202 (1.14% total OVHR) and 997 involved SBR (0.94% total OVHR). ENT was more common during elective procedures (1.2% elective vs 1.0% non-elective;p=&lt;0.01) while SBR was more common during non-elective admissions (0.48%vs1.64%;p=&lt;0.01).

Compared to OVHR without ENT or SBR, ENT and SBR groups were older (60.5 OVHR vs 62.0 ENT and 64.1 SBR; both p=&lt;0.01). Mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was lowest in the ENT group and highest in the SBR group (1.34 vs 1.17 and 1.53;both p=&lt;0.01). Smoking history was less common in SBR (12.5% vs 12.3% and 10.2%;p=0.83 and 0.03). Rates of diabetes were similar (24.2% vs 23.5% and 22.5%;p=0.61 and 0.21). ENT and SBR patients were less likely to be obese (31.7% vs 25.9% and 28.9%;p=&lt;0.01 and 0.07). ENT patients had more readmission within 90 days after elective or non-elective primary admissions (elective: 16.2% OVHR vs 23.0% ENT,p=&lt;0.01; non-elective: 19.4% OVHR vs 25.0% ENT,p=&lt;0.01). SBR patients had the highest readmission rate but remained unchanged by elective/non-elective primary admission (26.2% vs 26.2%). ENT or SBR had longer median length of stay(LOS) (4 days OVHR vs 6 ENT and 8 SBR; both p=&lt;0.01) and higher hospital charges ($34,790 vs $81,966 and $106,298;both p=&lt;0.01). The most common readmission diagnosis was infection (33.0%OVHR vs 33.3%ENT and 34.8%SBR;p=0.90/0.55). ENT and SBR were more often readmitted for obstruction (7.3% vs 12.1% vs 10.7%;p=&lt;0.01/0.04). There was no difference in reoperation for recurrence (4.9% vs 6.4% vs 3.5%;p=0.30/0.33), but ENT was more likely to have reoperation for obstruction (1.3% vs 5.3% vs 2.8%;p=&lt;0.01 and 0.053). Logistic regression models demonstrated that ENT and SBR were independently associated with readmission (OR 1.33 ENT, 1.36 SBR).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Compared to OVHR without ENT or SBR, both ENT and SBR are associated with longer LOS, increased charges, and higher readmission rates. OVHR with ENT or SBR was associated with higher rates of readmission and reoperation for obstruction, but no difference in readmission for infection.

Howe<sup>1</sup>, J. R. Gillen<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine, Carilion Clinic, Department Of Surgery, Roanoke, VA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

The opioid epidemic has instigated widespread re-evaluation of opioid prescribing practices. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of new electronic medical record (EMR) order sets on current general surgery opioid prescribing practices. We hypothesize that with implementation of standardized guidelines, a reduction in opioid prescribing can be achieved.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This is a single institution prospective cohort study of patients ages 18-89 who underwent inpatient general surgery with length of stay (LOS) &lt; 2 days between October 2018 and March 2021. Cohorts pre- and post- implementation of standardized postoperative EMR order sets in October 2020 were compared. Procedure specific guidelines for prescribed opioids in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) were recommended. Primary outcome assessed was discharge MME. Cohort comparisons were performed with Chi-square analysis. Threshold for significance was considered p&lt;0.005 after Bonferroni adjustment.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There was no difference in baseline characteristics of pre- (n=5098) and post-intervention (n=1113) cohorts (Table 1). There was a significant reduction in discharge MME post intervention (70.11 vs 86.49, p&lt;0.0001) without associated increase in opioid refills. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Surgery patients represent a vulnerable population in the present opioid epidemic. Implementation of EMR order sets maximizing nonopioid analgesia was associated with decreased postoperative opioid utilization. Utilizing procedure specific opioid prescribing guidelines for outpatient general surgery can further optimize surgeon opioid prescribing practices.

Perforated peptic ulcer is an acute surgical emergency and surgical intervention is the standard of care. However, in certain patients the risk of surgery outweighs its benefit, and they are simply better suited for conservative management. This current study compares the outcomes of surgical and conservative management of patients with a perforated peptic<br fgid=""23339"" />
ulcer.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

National Inpatient Database (NIIS 1998-2014) was used to identify patients admitted with a perforated peptic ulcer (ICD 531.10, 532.10). Standard statistical methods were used to evaluate demographic data and outcomes of patients who were treated conservatively or with surgery.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

10,033 patients were admitted with an acute perforated peptic ulcer, with a M to F ratio 0.97:1. Mean age was 62.3&plusmn;2 years. 58.8% of patients were Caucasian, 10.2% African American, 5.0% Hispanic and 2.7% Asian Pacific Islanders. 1,209 (12%) patients received no surgery, while 8,824 (88%) underwent surgery. Average age was 62.1&plusmn;19.0 in surgery and 63.9 &plusmn;18.9 in no-surgery group. Surgery was the prevalent treatment across all races with no significant difference in treatment and discharge to home status. Nearly 55% patients in both groups were discharged to home. Mortality rate was 11.4% in surgery compared to 14.3% in no- surgery group, p &lt;0.01. Surgical patients developed complications more commonly than no- surgery group, especially cardiac (4.1% vs. 1.0%) and respiratory complications (11.2% vs. 5.5%) were statistically significant, p &lt;0.01. 83.9% of patients in rural hospitals underwent surgery, compared to 89.8% at urban non-teaching and 87.8% at urban teaching hospitals, p&lt;0.01. The hospitalization cost and LOS was significantly higher in the surgical group, p&lt;0.01.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 

Surgery is the prevalent form treatment for perforated peptic ulcer, across allraces. Surgical intervention is less common in rural hospitals. Surgical intervention is associated with higher cardiac and respiratory complications, increased cost of care and LOS.<br fgid=""23424"" />
However, mortality rates were significantly higher in no-surgery group (14.3% vs. 11.40%). Further single institution studies are needed to validate these findings and provide treatment guidelines.

Wolf<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch, Department Of Surgery, Galveston, TX, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch, School Of Medicine, Galveston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The number of research publications produced is strongly correlated to academic promotion and tenure. That said, clinician-scientists report growing difficulty in balancing clinical duties with teaching, professional, and research obligations. The continued struggle presents the question of whether research productivity is quantitatively related to clinical activity. Our study aims to identify correlations, if any, of research publications and clinical performance benchmarks in academic surgical departments.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An electronic search was performed using SCOPUS to identify 14 Departments of Surgery in Texas academic institutions from 1970 to 2020. Texas was divided into three regions (Gulf Coast, West Texas, and Central/Northeast Texas) by geographic location and city population to equalize distribution. The number of published articles in 2019 was correlated to clinical activity for the same year obtained from the American Hospital Directory. The database lists statistics from hospitals in Texas in various categories including staffed hospital beds, total discharges, patient days, gross revenue, number of Medicare inpatients, average length of stay, average charges, and Medicare CMI. Pearson correlation analysis was utilized to compare number of publications to these clinical performance benchmarks.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Data showed a steady increase in the total number of published articles from the 14 Texas institutions from 1970-2020. When stratified by the three regions for 2019, we found a strong negative correlation (r = -0.91) with the number of publications to sum of the average charges for clinical care. We also found a strong positive correlation (r = 0.87) between the total number of surgical publications in 2019 and the sum of the average length of stay. All other variables had weak or no correlation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The strong negative correlation for number of publications and average charges per institution stands as the best indication that research productivity positively effects clinical activity, even among academic institutions. We also found that research productivity is correlated with increased average length of hospital stay as another clinical impact of increasing research effort. While surprising, such findings should be considered in strategic management of academic surgical institutions.

We therefore assessed whether frail patients were especially vulnerable to increased mortality associated with fragmented post-surgical care.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using Medicare inpatient claims data from 2005-2016, we examined a cohort of 221,225 surgical patients who underwent hip replacement, knee replacement, colectomy, coronary artery bypass grafting, or pulmonary lobectomy and were then readmitted following surgery. A multivariable logistic regression was used to assess whether higher odds of mortality were associated with frail patients receiving fragmented post-surgical care.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 28% of patients in the sample were frail as defined by a validated claims-based index, and 25% were readmitted to a different hospital from the one where their surgery was performed. 30-day mortality was highest in frail patients with fragmented care (4.1%) and lowest in non-frail patients with unfragmented care (2.1%), and this remained true when examining risk-adjusted 30-day mortality. Fragmentation of care resulted in an equal adverse effect on 30-day mortality across both frail and non-frail patients (0.77% increase in mortality among frail patients, 0.75% increase in mortality among non-frail patients, p = 0.96).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Frail patients receiving fragmented post-surgical care were associated with nearly double the mortality of non-frail patients without fragmented post-surgical care, highlighting the additive effects of fragmentation and frailty on mortality. Given that fragmentation poses an additional burden to frail patients already facing increased post-surgical mortality, frailty pathways for surgical patients and geriatric centers of excellence should aim to reduce fragmented post-surgical care for frail patients in order to improve outcomes for this vulnerable patient population.

Telem<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Use of mesh in clean/contaminated and contaminated ventral hernia repair (VHR) is controversial. While longitudinal trials have shown that mesh reduces long-term hernia recurrence, other studies have raised concern over increased infectious complications when mesh is placed in a contaminated field. The impact of this conflicting evidence on real-world mesh use is also poorly understood. We conducted the following study to understand current practice and outcomes in mesh use for clean/contaminated and contaminated VHR.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review of the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative Hernia Registry (MSQC-HR), which is a novel, statewide clinical registry that captures granular hernia-specific variables such as location and mesh use for patients undergoing VHR. The study cohort was adult patients undergoing clean/contaminated and contaminated VHR between January 1, 2020 and July 1, 2021. The exposure of interest was use of mesh which was classified as permanent or absorbable. The primary outcome was a composite end point of 30-day adverse events including complications, emergency department use, readmission, and reoperation. The secondary outcome was surgical site infection (SSI). Multivariable logistic regressions accounting for patient, hernia, and operative characteristics were estimated to calculate the independent association of mesh use with 30-day adverse events and SSI.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 275 patients underwent clean/contaminated and contaminated VHR performed by 152 surgeons at 49 hospitals. Mean age was 56.4 (13.9) years and 152 (55.3%) patients were female. Mesh was implanted in 169 (61.5%) patients and consisted of permanent mesh in 147 (87.0%) patients and absorbable mesh in 22 (13.0%) patients. 30-day adverse events occurred in 57 (33.7%) patients with mesh and 23 (21.7%) patients without mesh (P=0.033), whereas surgical site infection occurred in 16 (9.5%) patients with mesh and 5 (4.7%) patients without mesh (P=0.149). After adjusting for patient, hernia, and operative characteristics, mesh use was associated with higher odds of adverse events after surgery (aOR 2.83 [95% CI 1.48-5.41]), but was not associated with higher odds of SSI (aOR 2.57 [95% CI 0.81-8.10]) (Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this study of real-world mesh use in clean/contaminated and contaminated VHR, mesh was used in most patients and was almost exclusively permanent. Although mesh placement was not associated with increased odds of infection, it was associated with increased adverse events even after controlling for patient, hernia, and operative characteristics. This suggests that additional work using granular hernia-specific data is needed to understand how mesh use drives adverse events after surgery in this population.

<strong>Introduction</strong>: Adoption of the Di Vinci robotic surgical platform has grown exponentially in the field of general surgery. Many procedures performed open or laparoscopically for decades are now routinely performed robotically. In this study we aimed to analyze pertinent clinical outcomes among published studies comparing laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia surgery (LIHS) to robotic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia (RIHS) repair. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A comprehensive literature review of PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials was conducted. Keywords searched included inguinal hernia, robotic surgery, and laparoscopic surgery. The outcomes we sought to analyze between the two groups were operative time, post op pain and recurrence rates. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Ten studies involving a total of 25,778 patients were identified. 74.3% underwent LIHS, and 25.7 % underwent RIHS. Among 8 studies reporting operative time, RIHS required an additional 30 minutes to perform. While the majority of studies reported on post-operative pain, only 2 studies used the same scale therefore, these two studies were analyzed using relative risk (RR = 0.463), which revealed a 53.7% risk reduction with RIHS, although not statistically significant. RIHS was associated with a 20.2% reduction in hernia recurrence at one year, compared to LIHS; but this was not statistically significant (RR =0.798, 95% CI [0.100-6.346], p &lt; 0.831), as seen in figure 1.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: RIHS requires prolonged operative time compared to LIHS, but this may be partially attributable to the learning curve for robotic procedures and further analyses is required to better understand this. RIHS is associated with a trend towards decreased post-operative pain and recurrence rates at one year. RIHS is associated with comparable if not superior clinical outcomes to LIHS at the expenses of prolonged operative times. Much remains to be learned about the indications to incorporate robotic technology in the everyday practice of general surgery, as we seek to improve the patient experience and outcomes.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a serious concern as the most common healthcare-associated infection costing an estimated $3.3 billion annually with an associated nearly 1 million additional inpatient days annually. Although rates of infection in surgical wounds have decreased over the years, class I (clean), class II (clean/contaminated), class III (contaminated) and class IV (dirty/infected) wounds still constitute a 2.6%, 6.7%, 8.6% and 11.8%, respectively, of developing any SSI (superficial, deep incisional, and organ/space). Porcine urinary bladder matrix (PUBM) is a xenograft that contributes to the proliferation and migration of cells and their subsequent differentiation in tissue development. Prior studies have shown the use of PUBM in healing of lower extremity and abdominal wall chronic wounds; however, these are limited to small cohort and case studies. Our goal was to assess surgical site infections and time to primary closure in patients undergoing PUBM implantation for surgical wound management.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective review was conducted on patients 18 to 89 years of age with class I, II, III, and IV wounds who were treated with PUBM surgical implantation at a single institution over an 8 year time period. Patient demographics, preoperative labs, comorbidities, surgical anatomical location, infection rates (surgical site and organ/space), 30 day morbidity, and subsequent reoperation information was collected and analyzed by wound class. Wound classification and surgical site infection documentation was based on definitions outlined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

384 patients fit the inclusion criteria: 228 (59.4%) were male with a mean BMI of 31.69&plusmn; 9.54. Comorbidity data indicated 164 (42.7%) smokers, 108 (28.1%) with Type II diabetes, 179 (46.6%) with hypertension, and 83 (21.6%) with dyslipidemia. When stratified by wound classification, there were 40 (10.4%) class I, 70 (18.2%) class II, 159 (41.4%) class III, and 115 (29.9%) class IV wounds. There were no superficial, deep, or organ/space infections seen in class I or II wounds. Superficial, deep incisional, and organ/space infections rates were 1.3%, 0%, and 0.6% in class III wounds and 0.9%, 0.9%, and 0.9% in class IV wounds. Average hospital length of stay was 18.34&plusmn; 22.5 days with primary myofascial closure achieved in 297 (95.5%) of patients at the time of PUBM implantation. The overall rate for all SSIs (superficial, deep incisional, and organ/space) for our patient cohort were 0%, 0%, 1.9%, and 2.6%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Based on our results, the use of PUBM implantation for all surgical wound classes resulted in very low SSI rates below the national averages.

Barrera<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>North Shore University And Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Surgery, Manhasset, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Current guidelines for nutrition in patients admitted to the hospital are based on data pertaining to patients with medical conditions. These paradigms do not lend themselves to patients with compromised gastrointestinal tracts who may enter the hospital system later in their continuum of disease. In our investigation, we looked at patients admitted to the surgical service with diagnoses of small bowel obstruction (SBO), diverticulitis, and pancreatitis to see if their calorie deficits correlated to outcomes. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In this retrospective study we examined the relationship between pre-hospital nutrition deficits and in-hospital nutrition deficits and outcomes such as discharge disposition, complications, ambulatory status, and 30-day readmission in patients with diverticulitis, acute pancreatitis, or SBO. Records from 313 patients were included in the study. Pre-admission nutritional deficits were estimated using patient-reported days with significant nausea, emesis, and absent oral intake; inpatient deficits were estimated using total days kept NPO.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 61% (n=190), had a diagnosis of SBO, 21% (n=67) had a diagnosis of pancreatitis, and 18% (n=56) had a diagnosis of diverticulitis. Forty-two percent (n=131) of patients were male. Median age was 65 years (IQR: 51 to 79). Median number of days sick prior to hospital admission was 1 (IQR: 1 to 2). Median pre-hospital caloric deficit was 1882 kcal (IQR: 1355 to 3650). Median number of days NPO while in-hospital was 3 (IQR: 2 to 5). Median in-hospital caloric deficit was 4268 kcal (IQR: 2825 to 6610). Forty-one percent (n=127) of patients had surgery. Median pre-hospital caloric deficit was 1768 kcal (IQR: 1355 to 3075) in SBO patients, 1940 kcal (IQR: 1355 to 3893) in pancreatitis patients, and 3014 kcal (IQR: 1470 to 4254) in diverticulitis patients. Median number of days NPO while in-hospital was 3 (IQR: 2 to 4) in SBO patients, 4 (IQR: 3 to 5) in pancreatitis patients, and 2.5 (IQR: 2 to 4) in diverticulitis patients. Median in-hospital caloric deficit was 3892 kcal (IQR: 2712 to 6200) in SBO patients, 5184 kcal (IQR: 3720 to 8262) in pancreatitis patients, and 3880 kcal (IQR: 2652 to 5821) in diverticulitis patients. After univariable and multivariable analysis, there was no statistically significant association between pre-hospital caloric deficits and discharge disposition, functional status, or 30-day readmission rate. The biggest limitation was the heterogeneity in patient population. Patient care differed based on diagnosis and physician. In particular, the course of treatment, e.g., when to take patients off NPO, and whether to have surgery or when to have surgery varied by physician.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There was a non-statistically significant trend of higher pre-hospital nutritional deficits correlating with poorer outcomes. More research is needed on surgical patients who are malnourished upon entry into the hospital as they may benefit from early TPN.

G. Bangla<sup>1</sup>, J. Dexter-Meldrum<sup>1</sup>, C. M. Divino<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Mount Sinai School Of Medicine, General Surgery, New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Risk of adverse events after surgery is exacerbated by physical inactivity, which negatively impacts insulin sensitivity, muscle strength, lung function, tissue oxygenation, and coagulability. The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) group recommends that patients spend at least two hours out of bed on the same day as surgery and six hours out of bed on each subsequent day until discharge. Although encouraging patients to ambulate as early as possible after colorectal surgery is standard of care, there is no evidence demonstrating an association between early ambulation and improved patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to test whether early ambulation, defined here as ambulation within the first 24 hours after surgery, leads to improved outcomes following colorectal surgery and to identify any patient or procedure-related predictors of early ambulation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We retrospectively analyzed 276 patients who underwent a collective 291 colorectal resections from June to December 2019. The time to first ambulation after surgery was calculated and correlated with 30-day postoperative outcomes as well as various patient and procedure-related characteristics. Postoperative outcomes included length of stay, complications, returns to the ED, and readmissions. All complications were assigned scores 0 to 5 using the Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification system. We also pooled the three adverse postoperative outcomes together, creating a combined variable encompassing any complication, return to the ED, or readmission.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Following 291 procedures, 122 (41.9%) of patients ambulated within 24 hours after surgery. Patients with a history of dementia were less likely to ambulate within 24 hours (p=0.04), and patients with ASA status 2-3 ambulated earlier than patients with ASA status 4-5 (p=0.03). Patients who ambulated within 24 hours had a decreased risk of complications with CD score &ge;2 (p=0.04) as well as a decreased risk of more serious complications with CD score &ge;3 (p=0.02). After adjusting for ASA status, the association between early ambulation and decreased complications remained significant for the CD score &ge;3 cutoff (p=0.04). Patients who did not ambulate within 24 hours were significantly more likely to return to the ED, be readmitted, or experience complications with CD score &ge;2 (p=0.01) and &ge;3 (p=0.02), as calculated in our combined outcome variable. These associations remained statistically significant after controlling for ASA status for both the CD score &ge;2 (p=0.02) and &ge;3 (p=0.03) cutoff.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study demonstrates that early ambulation leads to improved postoperative outcomes after colorectal surgery. Specifically, patients who ambulated within 24 hours postoperatively had significantly fewer adverse outcomes within 30 days. Early ambulation should be stressed in the immediate postoperative period to reduce the risk of significant clinical complications, returns to the ED, and readmissions.

Perea<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health, Department Of Surgery, Division Of Trauma And Acute Care Surgery, Lancaster, PA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Department Of Surgery, Philadelphia, PA, USA&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health, Research Institute, Lancaster, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

The timing of cholecystectomy for management for acute cholecystitis has been previously investigated, with recommendation for early cholecystectomy. However, the optimal timing for cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease is less clear. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the optimal timing for cholecystectomy in the setting of symptomatic gallbladder disease.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This was a retrospective, single institution study from 1/2013-12/2020 of all adult ( &ge;18y) patients who presented either to the outpatient setting or emergency department and were diagnosed with symptomatic gallbladder disease defined by corresponding ICD 9/10 codes. Exclusion criteria included: presence of significant comorbidities/sepsis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement, diagnosed gallstone pancreatitis or choledocholithiasis at time of presentation, or concomitant surgical procedures unrelated to the management of gallbladder disease.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 4394 patients were included in the study. A total of 162 morbidities (3.67%) were identified postoperatively within the first 30 days. Post-operative pain (1.27%) was the most commonly encountered morbidity. Other morbidities more frequently observed were retained gallstone (0.64%), bile leak (0.46%), intra-abdominal abscess (0.41%), and surgical site infection (0.27%). The results of this study did not reveal an increase in morbidity if cholecystectomy was performed more than 72 hours from initial diagnosis (p=0.779). A significant correlation was found between increased operative time and morbidity (p=0.016). Figure 1 demonstrates that there is no difference between 30 day morbidity and days to surgery.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Optimal timing for cholecystectomy in gallbladder disease is patient specific. Early cholecystectomy is recommended in patients with acute cholecystitis; however, the results of this review do not suggest an increase in morbidity with cholecystectomy after 72 hours in patients with all cause symptomatic gallbladder disease. This study found that increased operative time portends an increased risk of morbidity, and further factors to elucidate why may need to be further investigated. The clinical value of this study should not be understated because surgeons are often faced with the clinical dilemma of determining timing for cholecystectomy in patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease. Yet, it is important to be vigilant to identify subjective and objective findings which may be suggestive of acute cholecystitis prompting earlier cholecystectomy. Further studies evaluating operative findings in comparison to pre-operative diagnosis may be useful and provide further recommendations for timing of cholecystectomy.

Chiu<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Stanford University, Pediatric Surgery, Palo Alto, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Pilonidal Disease (PD) is an acquired infectious and inflammatory condition at the gluteal cleft, presenting with recurrent pain and purulent discharge. Repeated disruption in patient&rsquo;s everyday life due to PD leads to a sense of personal failure and inadequacy that aggravates the social and psychological consequences of PD in this age group. Since PD affects adolescents and young adults, it can have long term morbidity during this developmentally important period of life. Recent minimally invasive surgery (MIS) advancement including trephination and laser hair removal has been associated with lower morbidities. We hypothesize that the severely impacted PD patients can improve their quality of life (QOL) using MIS approach.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A total of 131 patients with PD presented to our tertiary academic center and underwent MIS treatment from 2019 to 2021. All patients received a questionnaire at initial presentation and at each follow up visit. Questions were categorized into 4 groups based on the effect of the disease on 1. ability to play sports, 2. daily routine activity, 3. attending school/work, and 4. socializing. Responses to QOL questions before and after treatment were reviewed. Student&rsquo;s t test was used in data analysis. P value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 101 (51 male and 50 female) patients completed the questionnaires and were included in our study. 25% of patients were Hispanic, 27% White, and 32% declined to report their ethnicity. Patient age ranged from 14 to 20 years with a median age of 17. At initial presentation, patients&rsquo; ability to participate in sports was moderately or severely impacted in 56% of respondents. After treatment, 92% of patients reported no to minimal impact which was significantly improved (P&lt;0.01). Daily activities were moderately or severely impacted in 65% of patients prior to treatment and decreased to 1% after treatment (P&lt;0.01). School/work attendance was moderately or severely affected in 45% of patients pre-treatment and decreased to 0% after (P&lt;0.01). Socializing was moderately or severely impacted in 25% of patients pre-treatment and decreased to 1% after (P&lt;0.01)(Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: PD affects multiple QOL measurements in a profoundly negative way. This can be significantly improved with the MIS treatment approach.

We aim to evaluate the value of care in patients who underwent surgery assessing quality/cost domains by the construction of score cards as surrogates for service line value including the preliminary results of a randomized control trial on perforated at presentation acute appendicitis. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Quality domains (Observed/Expected) assessed on index admission included post-operative complications (PC standardized by grading system), length of stay (LOS in days), 30-day readmission (RA), patient satisfaction index (PS), and textbook cases (TB). Total charges (TC) and reimbursement index (RI, O/E) were included as surrogates for cost. Clinical variables (v=81) from patients (&gt; 18 yo) were retrieved from a Health System Warehouse retrospectively (Jan-2010 to July-2016), and prospectively (Aug- 2016 to Dec-2020), under IRB- approved protocols. Uni/multivariate analyses were conducted (MATLAB r2020b).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1987 patients underwent appendicectomies (MI 86%, MI converted to open 4%, and open 3%) with a gender distribution 1:1. Their age and BMI was 38&plusmn;16 years and 29.6&plusmn;7.5 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Domain surrogates for service line are summarized in Table 1.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: MI appendicectomies showed a high value as service line in our Healthnet System. Protocols have been implemented to decreasing LOS. Surgery for perforated appendicitis showed a lower value. Conservative treated perforated appendicitis with an interval MI appendectomy appears to be a strategy to hold a higher value.

Post-operative hypocalcemia is the most common complication after thyroidectomy and a hurdle to safely performing outpatient thyroidectomy. Postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) level has been shown to be predictive of post-operative hypocalcemia and can be an important tool in patient selection for outpatient surgery. This study was performed to determine the level of post-operative PTH that can be used as a threshold to safely discharge patient on the day of thyroidectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing total or completion thyroidectomy. All surgeries were performed by a single attending surgeon and multiple surgical residents at WellSpan York Hospital from July of 2018 to July 2020. Blood sample for PTH level was collected in recovery room within 1 hour of surgery. Microsoft Excel was used for data collection and analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our study included a total of 198 patients comprising of 47 men (23.7%) and 151 women (76.3%). The mean age was 50 years with age distribution from 17 to 82 years. One hundred and eighty-five patients (93.4%) underwent total thyroidectomy, and 13 patients (6.6%) underwent completion thyroidectomy. Forty-six out of 198 patients (23.2 %) developed hypoparathyroidism (PTH &lt; 12 pg/ml) after surgery. Of these 46 patients, 15 patients had a PTH level between 6 and 11 pg/ml and 31 patients had an undetectable PTH level (&lt;6 pg/nl). IV calcium was required by 1 out of 15 patients (6.7%) with postoperative PTH levels between 6 and 11 pg/nl, and 10 out 31 patients (32.3%) with postoperative PTH &lt; 6. Out of 152 patients with normal postoperative PTH levels (12 pg/nl or greater), no patients required IV calcium or were readmitted with hypocalcemia. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: PTH level of 6 or greater can be used as threshold to identify patients safe for outpatient thyroidectomy. Patients with PTH levels &lt; 6 should be observed in hospital because of risk of post-operative hypocalcemia.

Broman<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Extent of surgery for clinically node-negative (cN0) papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) less than 4 cm varies nationwide, but there is increasing evidence that total thyroidectomy (TT) and prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) provide limited oncologic or survival benefit for low-risk patients and are associated with increased postoperative complications. The purpose of this study was to determine factors that are associated with increased likelihood of total thyroidectomy with pCND in cN0 PTC less than 4 cm in size.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Retrospective data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) were used. Included adult patients had cN0 PTC less than 4 cm in size and underwent surgical resection from 2012 to 2017. The primary outcome was performance of total thyroidectomy with pCND compared to lobectomy alone. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify patient, disease, and facility characteristics associated with extent of surgery.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 57,402 included patients, 80.3% were female, with an average age of 51 years. This group was predominantly white (82.6%), and insured privately (66.5%) or through Medicare (20.4%) or Medicaid (8.2%). The majority underwent total thyroidectomy, either with CND (36.7%) or without (39.8%), while fewer underwent lobectomy with CND (6.4%) or without CND (16.9%). The following facility types were represented: academic center (34.4%), comprehensive community cancer program (25.7%), integrated network cancer program (9.9%), community cancer program (4.5%); facility type was unknown in 25.5% of patients. Further analysis was performed to compare factors associated with extent of surgery between lobectomy alone and TT+pCND subgroups. When comparing lobectomy alone (n=9,712) versus TT+pCND (n=21,119), the lobectomy group was more likely to be male, black, and treated at a community cancer program facility. Patients with tumors 1-4 cm and treated at mid- or high-volume centers were more likely to receive TT+pCND. A temporal trend of increasing performance of lobectomy alone compared to TT+pCND was noted over the study period of 2012 to 2017 (Table 1). No statistically significant differences associated with comorbidity burden, payor, education or income status were detected.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Performance of total thyroidectomy and prophylactic central neck dissection in clinically node negative papillary thyroid cancer less than 4 cm in size is declining, but remains common particularly for patients treated at academic and mid- to high-volume centers. This suggests that even at these centers, timely adaptation to evolving best practices remains difficult.

We examined the influence of patient preference on physician decision-making and management of DTC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We surveyed American Thyroid Association (ATA) members using three clinical vignettes: 1) indeterminate thyroid nodule, 2) tall-cell variant papillary thyroid cancer, and 3) papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. Participants judged the risks and benefits of different treatment options. After physicians chose their recommended treatment, they were asked if they would be willing to change their selected management upon informed patient request or if they would decline and refer the patient elsewhere. Demographics of participants were compared with the general population of the ATA membership to assess for non-response bias. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 183 respondents (13.4% response rate), 39% were surgeons, 52% were endocrinologists, and 3% were nuclear medicine physicians. Most respondents were male (64%) and had an academic practice setting (63%). Respondents were demographically similar to the entire ATA membership except for a modest over-representation of surgeons. In the three clinical vignettes, when patients requested a more conservative treatment option, 91%-98% of respondents complied with patient request. There was no significant difference in perceived increased risk of cancer recurrence with more conservative treatment between the physicians who declined to de-escalate versus the physicians who complied with patient preference. When patients requested more aggressive treatment, 91%-97% of respondents complied. Perception of increased operative risk (permanent surgical complications) with more aggressive treatment did not differ between physicians who declined versus physicians who complied with patient preference. When asked to describe their personal approach to thyroid cancer, respondents who consider patient preference would agree to more aggressive surgical treatment up to an increased risk of surgical complications of 20% (IQR 6%-50%). Similarly, respondents who consider patient preference would agree to more conservative management even if it increased risk of cancer recurrence by 20% (IQR 10%-25%).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The vast majority of thyroid specialists allowed informed patients to dictate the management of their DTC, even if it incurred an additional 20% risk of surgical complications or cancer recurrence. Educating patients about the subjective nature of thyroid cancer decision-making may help empower patients in shared decision-making.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review was performed for patients evaluated in the Multidisciplinary Endocrine Tumor Clinic, started in 2018 (MDETC) and Multidisciplinary Thyroid Cancer Clinic, started in 2019 (MDTCC) through 2021. Variables collected included referral, appointment, and surgical dates, and zip codes; undergoing surgery and time from evaluation to surgical intervention were the outcome variables. Patients evaluated in an endocrine surgery clinic (ESC) from 2017-2021 served as the control. Chi-square and t-tests were used for analysis, as appropriate.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Patients referred to the ESC underwent surgery more often than those referred to either multidisciplinary clinic (MDTCC 7%, MDETC 24.6%, ESC 79.48%, p&lt;0.001), but had a significantly longer delay between appointment and operation (ESC 19.94 days, MDETC 3.29 days, MDTCC 16.4 days; p&lt;0.001).

Symptoms of Graves&rsquo; disease are wide ranging and may include heart palpitations, fatigue, tremors, and diarrhea. Graves&rsquo; disease is typically treated with either radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or total thyroidectomy. Total thyroidectomy (TT) has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for Graves&rsquo; disease. However, the time course for improvement or resolution of subjective symptoms has not been defined.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: With institutional review board approval, we performed a review of prospectively-gathered survey data of all patients undergoing TT for Graves&rsquo; disease at a single institution from 2019-2021. After informed consent was obtained, patients electing to participate (N=79) filled out surveys preoperatively and at post-operative follow-up visits/phone calls. All patients were operated on by one of three high-volume endocrine surgeons. Patient demographics as well as survey results were collected and analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank analysis.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 50 patients completed the survey on postoperative follow-up (response rate 63%). The mean follow-up was 5 months (0.5-14 months). Average age was 38 years (12-80) and 88% of patients were female. The most common preoperative symptoms were fatigue (90%) and heat/cold intolerance (88%). Tremor, diarrhea, and palpitations were the symptoms that resolved most quickly, with a median resolution of 1 week or by the first follow-up visit. Median resolution of symptoms was 3 weeks for exophthalmos, heat/cold intolerance, fatigue, anxiety, and memory deficit. Depression, seen in 32% of patients, took the longest to improve, with a median time to improvement of 10 weeks. There were no significant differences in time to resolution of symptoms by gender or age. Only three patients (6%) had any symptoms remaining at 12 months.



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Many Graves&rsquo; disease symptoms improve rapidly following TT, with a median time to improvement of less than 1 month. Understanding the typical time course is important for counseling patients and managing expectations pre- and postoperatively.

Arrangoiz<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Center of Advanced Surgical Oncology, Surgical Oncology / General Surgery, Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is one of the most common endocrine diseases and the most common cause of hypercalcemia. The diagnosis is made biochemically. The only definite and curative treatment is parathyroidectomy. Historically, surgical excision of parathyroid adenomas required bilateral neck exploration with the risk of hypocalcemia, severe hemorrhage or recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction. Accurate preoperative imaging is necessary in the selection of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy such as ultrasonography (USG), Sestamibi, SPECT, 4D-CT, and PET-CT. Nowadays, preoperative localization studies have become standard before surgical treatment, and the first stage imaging methods are ultrasonography and/or scintigraphy. We compared the different techniques and outcomes by a review of the literature.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This is a retrospective study from a prospectively kept database that included thirty-one patients with the confirmed diagnosis of pHPT clinically and biochemically. All patients were evaluated with preoperative ultrasound and scintigraphy and underwent surgery, limited neck exploration and minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis and surgical findings were compared to the preoperative findings.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Thirty-one patients with confirmed diagnosis of pHPT were evaluated retrospectively. The age range was from 29 to 87 years old, with an average age of 57.8 years old. Twenty-four patients were women (77%) and seven patients were men (23%). The preoperative serum calcium average was 10.24 mg/dL (range: 8.8 to 11.9 mg/dL). Preoperative ultrasound and surgery findings were compared with a sensitivity of 51%. Preoperative scintigraphy and surgery findings were compared resulting in a sensitivity of 71%. Both imaging methods combined, resulted in a sensitivity of 80%. Six patients had negative US and Sestamibi with surgery findings of positive parathyroid gland lesion resulting in a 20% of false negatives. Twenty-five patients had a confirmed pathology report of a single-adenoma (80%), two patients with a double-adenoma (6%), and four patients with parathyroid hyperplasia (13%). No triple-adenoma was reported.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

In patients with pHPT, scintigraphy is an effective method for localizing parathyroid pathology preoperatively but the false negative rate can be high. US tends to have a wider range explained by the operator-dependent factor. The combination of US and Sestamibi reduces the rate of false negatives, as reported in international literature. It is important to mention that these studies cannot be used as a confirmatory test for this disease. There is no consensus on the most effective preoperative tool among the variable options. Certainly, we need to assure an effective surgery by preparing preoperatively with imaging tools for having a safe and non-recurrent disease.

Although imaging plays no role in diagnosis, it is essential for preoperative localization when a focused parathyroidectomy is planned. We hypothesized that identification of enlarged parathyroid glands on imaging obtained prior to the diagnosis of PHPT has the ability to impact the preoperative evaluation and intraoperative course of patients undergoing parathyroidectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The study included adult patients with a diagnosis of PHPT who underwent parathyroidectomy between 10/2015 and 10/2020 and had contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the lower neck and upper chest prior to diagnosis for unrelated indications. A neuroradiologist retrospectively viewed these prior scans blinded to the operative findings, and a surgeon compared the imaging findings to preoperative notes and operative reports to determine whether and how information derived from prior imaging might have impacted the preoperative work-up and intraoperative course of these patients.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified at least one visibly enlarged parathyroid gland on a prior contrast-enhanced CT in 30 (75%) of 40 included patients. The average time between the oldest scan where an enlarged parathyroid was visible and parathyroidectomy was 4.6 years (range 0.9 to 11.4). Despite old imaging enabling correct localization, 16 of these 30 (53.3%) underwent a sestamibi scan and 2 (6.7%) underwent a parathyroid CT prior to parathyroidectomy. Additionally, knowledge of the enlarged parathyroid(s) on prior imaging might have allowed a more focused approach in 3 (10.0%) and prevented 1 unnecessary thyroid lobectomy performed in search of disease. Similarly, localizable disease on old imaging might have prompted a more thorough exploration in 4 (13.3%) and possibly prevented missed disease and failure to cure in 3 (10.0%). We determined that viewing prior imaging could potentially change the preoperative evaluation in 70.0% of patients with localizable disease on old imaging and the operative course in 23.3%. When considering the entire cohort with relevant old contrast-enhanced imaging available, conservative estimates indicate reviewing these scans might alter the preoperative work-up in 52.5% of patients presenting with PHPT and the operative course in 17.5%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The identification of enlarged parathyroid glands on imaging that predates a diagnosis of PHPT has the potential to impact the preoperative evaluation and intraoperative course of patients undergoing parathyroidectomy. When available, prior contrast-enhanced CT imaging should be reviewed prior to obtaining additional imaging or planning the operative approach.

It is not known which etiology is most prevalent in patients undergoing thyroidectomy while actively hyperthyroid. Therefore, our aim was to examine the relationship between thyrotoxicosis, hypocalcemia, and hypoparathyroidism.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review was performed of prospectively-collected data from all patients undergoing thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism by 4 surgeons from 2016-2020. All patients carried a diagnosis of Graves&rsquo; disease or toxic multi-nodular goiter. Patient demographics, preoperative medications, laboratory reports, and postoperative complications were reviewed. The primary outcome was determining the etiology of hypocalcemia, if it developed postoperatively. The secondary outcome was duration of postop calcium use. Chi-square tests were used for bivariate analysis, as appropriate. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 204 patients were identified, with mean age of 40.5 years (range 6-86). Most patients were female (81%), had Graves&rsquo; disease (76%), and underwent total thyroidectomy (92%). At the time of surgery, 118 (58%) had uncontrolled hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxic group, Free T4 &gt;1.64 or Free T3 &gt;4.4), with the remaining 86 (42%) considered euthyroid. Postoperative hypocalcemia (calcium &lt;8.5 mg/dL) developed in 27 (13%), while hypoparathyroidism (PTH &lt;12 pg/mL) was observed in 39 (19%). Thyrotoxic patients comprised a majority of those with hypocalcemia (n=22, 81%, p&lt;0.01) and hypoparathyroidism immediately following surgery (n=29, 74%, p=0.02). However, a majority of initially hypocalcemic, thyrotoxic patients had normal PTH values within the first month after surgery (n=19, 86%), consistent with hungry bone syndrome. On bivariate analysis, no significant relationship was found for thyrotoxic patients with initial postoperative hypocalcemia (18%) and hypoparathyroidism &lt;1-month after surgery (29%, p=0.292) or between 1 and 6 months (2%, p=0.241). Of the 19 patients in the hungry bone group, 17 (89%) were off all calcium supplements by 6 months postop. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In patients with hyperthyroidism, those in active thyrotoxicosis at time of surgery have a higher rate of postoperative hypocalcemia compared to euthyroid patients. Our data show a majority of these patients exhibit hungry bone syndrome but typically require calcium supplementation no more than 6 months postoperatively.

We sought to review and assess the availability and accuracy of information on the internet regarding common operations within endocrine surgery. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using Google&rsquo;s search engine, we identified the top 100 websites which resulted from the search phrase &ldquo;parathyroid surgery,&rdquo; and the top 100 websites from the phrase &ldquo;thyroid surgery.&rdquo; Websites were excluded if they required a login or subscription. Three separate evaluators visited each website and assessed whether it was accessible and if the information was accurate, including presence of information about the hormonal function of the parathyroid/thyroid glands, the disease processes that may require surgery, and the procedure itself. Whether author credentials were provided, if the webpage had been updated within the past year, and if advertisements were present were also recorded. Finally, the degree of misinformation on each website was stratified based on the page having zero, one, two, or three or more errors. Interrater reliability was assessed using the kappa coefficient for each variable.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 100 websites were evaluated for each procedure and 100% of them were accessible. Inter-rater reliability ranged from 0.14 to 0.86 and achieved at least moderate agreement (&gt;0.41) for 56% of variables. For parathyroid surgery, 67% of websites included information about the procedure itself, 76% about hormone function, and 73% about disease processes. More than half (55%) of websites had no recorded inaccuracies, while 22%, 13% and 10% had one, two, and three or more errors, respectively. A minority of websites listed author credentials (25%) or provided references (18%). For thyroid surgery, 71% of websites included procedure information, 53% hormone function, and 56% disease processes. Again, a slight majority of websites (53%) had no errors, with 20%, 20%, and 7% having one, two, and three or more errors, respectively. About one-quarter of parathyroid sites listed author credentials (23%) or provided references (24%). Compared to thyroid sites, significantly more parathyroid sites contained ads (28% vs 17%, p=0.048) and were less likely to have been updated in the past year (38% vs 60%, p&lt;0.01). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Significant inaccuracies exist in the information available on the internet for both thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Just under half of sites evaluated contained at least one inaccuracy, and only a minority provided credentials for authors or cited references for their information. Given the degree of misinformation present online, providers should attempt to guide patients to where they can find reliable information about their condition.

Porterfield<sup>1</sup>, B. Lindeman<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, AL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy (MIA) is the gold standard for treatment of adrenal disease. Despite a favorable risk-benefit profile, inpatient admission post-operatively has remained common. Prior studies have shown that outpatient MIA was not associated with an increased 30-day complications or readmission, but this has not been explored in-depth by adrenalectomy indication. We aimed to examine whether the safety profile of outpatient MIA varies in specific disease processes such as Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome (CS) and pheochromocytoma (PC).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Clinicopathologic parameters were examined for all minimally-invasive adrenalectomies entered into an adrenal database at our institution from 2012-2021. Predi ctor variables included patient demographics, surgical indication, and operative time. Outcomes were compared between outpatient and inpatient MIA groups, with outpatients defined as same-day discharge with no overnight hospital stay after surgery. Outcomes were 30-day ED visit, readmission, and complication rates between surgical indications, comparing outpatient and inpatient groups. Statistical analyses were performed using Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney, and Chi-square tests, as appropriate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 258 MIA patients were included, with mean age of 58 years and 57.4% female. Outpatient MIA was performed in 81 patients (31.4%). The most common surgical indications were PC (n=62, 24%), non-functional (n=49, 19%), then hypercortisolism and hyperaldosteronism (both n=45, 17%). Among all patients, hours until discharge was significantly different based on surgical indication (p=0.01), with the longest stay among PC patients (40.1 hrs vs. 32.6 hrs, p=0.004). Outpatient discharge post-MIA was related to both surgical indication and operative time, with PC patients least often discharged post-operatively (10.9% vs. 24.7% p&lt;0.01), along with operations taking &gt;3 hours (13.6% vs 37.6%, p&lt;0.01). No significant differences were identified between outpatient and inpatient MIA groups for complications, ED visits, or readmission (p&gt;0.05 for all). Only 6 outpatient MIA patients had any complications (7%) and 3 were readmitted (3.7%). None of the 9 outpatient PC patients had a complication recorded. Compared to other indications, CS patients had a higher absolute rate of complications (17.8% vs 5.2%, p=0.11) and readmissions (15.6% vs 6.1%, p=0.04), and both were significant among the inpatient group (20.6% vs 4.0% and 30.4% vs 8.9%, respectively, p&lt;0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Outpatient MIA was demonstrated to be associated with similar, low complication and readmission rates compared to inpatient MIA, though it was utilized less often for patients with PC or prolonged operative times. CS patients had the highest rate of complications and readmissions, which were significantly higher among inpatients. Outpatient MIA can be safely utilized in selected patients across all indications for adrenal surgery.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) is common in end stage renal disease. The 2017 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Guidelines recommend keeping parathyroid hormone (PTH) below nine times the upper limit of normal with calcimimetics or vitamin D analogs and parathyroidectomy (PTx) if not responding to medical management. SHP may progress to tertiary hyperparathyroidism (THP) following renal transplantation (RT). We sought to determine factors associated with THP and describe outcomes of PTx for patients with SHP or THP.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted a single institution retrospective cohort study of adult patients undergoing index RT from August 2012 to December 2020 that had a PTH level within 12 months prior to RT. Patients were grouped by pre-RT PTH level above or below 800pg/ml. Development of THP was defined as a serum calcium &gt;10.5mg/dl at six months post-RT. Clinical and demographic factors were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann Whitney U, Kruskal Wallis, and chi-squared. A multivariable logistic regression was performed for factors associated with THP.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
PTH level within 12 months yielding 496 for analysis. Of these 18 (3.6%) had PTH &gt;800pg/ml. Eight (1.6%) had PTx prior to RT all of whom had a PTH &lt;800 at time of RT. There were no differences between the groups with regard to age, sex, race, preemptive or dialysis dependent, dialysis type, dialysis initiation age, cause of kidney disease, blood type, donor characteristics, Kidney Donor Profile Index, Calculated Panel Reactive Antibodies, delayed graft function, graft failure, post-RT length of hospital stay, rejection episodes, death or length of follow up. Patients with pre-RT PTH &gt; 800 also had higher inorganic phosphate pre-RT, more frequent RT complications, higher calcium at follow up (Table 1). Following RT, 11 patients (2.22%) developed THP, these patients had a higher mean pre-RT PTH 382 (SD 170) compared with those who did not develop THP 280 (SD 176) (p=0.049). To date, 5 of these patients have undergone PTx. For the 13 patients in this cohort who had PTx: 8 pre-RT and 5 post-RT; 2 had readmission for hypocalcemia. There were no other PTx complications. In multivariable regression, the only factor predictive of post-RT THP was post-RT calcium with an odds ratio of 4.2 (95% CI 1.1 &ndash; 17.0, p=0.049).
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
RT is uncommon at our institution for patients with PTH &gt; 800, though these patients may be at risk for higher RT complications. Few patients progress to THP though post RT elevated calcium may be associated with development of THP. PTx is safe for patients with SHP undergoing RT and THP following RT.

The aim of this study is to define the demographic factors and tumor characteristics associated with HCC survival using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Demographic factors including age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status as well as tumor characteristics including tumor grade and extent of disease in HCC patients from 2000-2018 were examined using the SEER-18 database.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 4,168 patients with HCC diagnosed on final pathology were identified. The 10-year OS for the cohort was 79.1% (95%CI: 77.6%-80.5%), while 10-year OS for localized, regional, and distant disease were 85.5% (95%CI:84.0%-86.90%), 66% (95%CI: 60.9%-70.7%), and 20.4% (95%CI: 14.4%-27.2%), respectively. On univariate analysis, age&lt;45yrs, female gender, white race, Hispanic ethnicity, higher household-income, lower tumor grade and stage were significantly associated with increased survival (p&lt;0.01). On multivariate regression analysis using Cox proportional hazard model, all variables except race and ethnicity remained significantly associated with overall mortality. Compared to women, males had a higher risk of death [HR=1.60 [95%CI: 1.39-1.84], p&lt;0.01]. Compared to localized HCC, advanced disease was associated with a significant increased risk of death: nodal involvement only (HR=1.82 [95%CI: 1.10&ndash;3.02], p=0.02), tissue extension only (HR=2.16 [95%CI: 1.62&ndash;2.88), p&lt;0.01), combined nodal and tissue extension (HR=4.28 [95%CI: 2.46&ndash;6.62], p&lt;0.01), and distant disease (HR=10.50 (95%CI: 8.40&ndash;13.11), p&lt;0.01). Compared to well-differentiated HCC, higher tumor grade was associated with a significant increased risk of death: moderately-differentiated, (HR=1.70 (95%CI: 1.18&ndash;2.44), p=0.04), poorly-differentiated(HR=2.90 (95%CI: 2.04&ndash;4.12), p&lt;0.01), and undifferentiated (HR=3.10 (95%CI: 1.95&ndash;4.92), p&lt;0.01). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study highlights the aggressive nature of HCC using the latest population-level data. Given the overall paucity of data available, further research is needed to understand the tumor behavior of this rare malignancy and identify those groups most at risk of poor outcomes.

Benharash<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>David Geffen School Of Medicine, University Of California At Los Angeles, Department Of Surgery, Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Thyroidectomy is commonly performed by both general surgeons (GS) and otolaryngologists (ENT). Although the importance of surgeon experience on outcomes following thyroidectomy has been well-established, studies on the influence of surgical specialty remain limited. The present study assessed the association of surgical specialty with both practice patterns and postoperative outcomes following total thyroidectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

All adults undergoing elective total thyroidectomy for neoplasm were identified from the 2016-19 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. Surgical specialty as well as other patient and operative characteristics were tabulated utilizing ACS-NSQIP&rsquo;s data dictionary. Outcomes of interest included rates of clinically severe hypocalcemia, laryngeal nerve injury and neck hematoma as well as operative time and length of stay. Multivariable regression models accounting for patient and operative variables were developed to assess the independent association between surgical specialty and these outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of 9,079 patients undergoing total thyroidectomy, 55.9% were treated by general surgeons and 44.1% by otolaryngologists. Compared to their counterparts, ENT patients were more likely to have tumor staging of at least 3A (25.0 vs 21.4%, P&lt;0.001) as well as nodal (27.6 vs 24.6%, P=0.001) and distant (1.2 vs 0.7%, P=0.008) metastasis. Although both specialties had similar utilization of laryngeal nerve monitoring (63.7 vs 65.4%, P=NS), ENT less frequently used Harmonic Scalpel or LigaSure (45.1 vs 79.5%, P&lt;0.001) but more often placed drains intraoperatively (49.3 vs 16.5%, P&lt;0.001). After multivariable adjustment, patients treated by ENT were at increased risk for clinically severe hypocalcemia though had decreased odds of laryngeal nerve injury (Figure). There were no differences in rate of neck hematoma. Notably, intraoperative nerve monitoring was not protective against laryngeal nerve injury (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 0.9, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.8-1.1, P=NS). Furthermore, utilization of Harmonic Scalpel or LigaSure (AOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.4, P=NS) as well as drain placement (AOR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7-1.8, P=NS) had no impact on rate of neck hematoma. Although ENT patients had shorter operative time, they incurred longer lengths of stay (Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Although most thyroidectomies are performed by general surgeons, otolaryngologists often encounter patients with advanced disease. While both perform this operation with acceptable outcomes, surgical specialty impacts rates of complications. Identification and standardization of practice patterns that mitigate these complications may prove beneficial in both specialties.

Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare diagnosis. The impact of treatment including clinical factors of extent of surgery, adjuvant therapy on overall survival are not well established. We aimed to determine clinical and demographic factors associated with survival for patients with parathyroid carcinoma from a large national database.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective review of patients with parathyroid carcinoma was performed using the National Cancer Database for patients diagnosed from 2004 through 2017. Clinical and demographic variables were assessed. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess for factors associated with survival. Overall survival (OS) rates were determined for 5- and 10-years. 

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

In the dataset 1,057 patients were available for analysis. The mean age at diagnosis was 57.5 years (standard deviation, SD, 14.0) and 542 (51.3%) were male. The mean reported tumor size was 42mm (SD 104). For extent of surgery: 38 (3.6%) had no surgery, 568 (53.7%) had incomplete resection, 359 (34.0%) had complete resection, 58 (5.5%) had radical resection, and 34 (3.2%) did not have extent of surgery specified. For the cohort, 488 (46.2%) had reported lymph nodes resected with a mean of 5.5 (SD 6.6) nodes removed. For patients with available lymph node pathology 32 (8.3%) had node positive disease with a range of one to six nodes positive. For adjuvant therapy, 159 (15.0%) had external beam radiation with a mean dose of 5,463 cGy (SD 1464). Overall, 214 patients died (21.55%), the five- and ten-year OS were 82.9% and 57.0%. In a Cox proportional hazard regression model age at diagnosis (p = 0.003) and extent of surgery (p = 0.0001) were associated with overall survival with hazard ratios of 1.04 (95% CI 1.01 &ndash; 1.06) for age and 0.04 (0.01-0.19) for incomplete resection, 0.04 (0.009-0.19) for complete resection, and 0.09 (0.02-0.44) for radical resection. 

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Patient age and extent of surgery are modestly associated with survival for parathyroid carcinoma but not patient sex, nodal metastases, or adjuvant therapy in this cohort.

The OR Black Box&reg; (ORBB) is an innovative platform that collects data from the operating room to improve quality and safety. The system captures audio and video of surgeon/operative team performance, environmental conditions, and patient status. The ORBB uses machine learning and trained reviewers to process the data and identify patterns of behavior that contribute to poor outcomes. As an initial step to facilitate implementation of the ORBB, we engaged with patient stakeholders to elicit their perspectives on (1) potential uses of the technology, (2) perceived benefits and harms to patients and health systems, and (3) legal/ethical issues related to data collection and management.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted a focus group with 10 members of a community advisory panel of patients who were treated in our local health system. Data were co-coded by two researchers experienced in qualitative methods, using a thematic analysis approach.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Several themes emerged from the focus group:

(1) Accountability: Patients expressed excitement about using the ORBB to enhance accountability of surgeons and operative staff by examining why mistakes occurred during surgery (&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just that accountability, I cannot stress that enough&rdquo;).

 

(2) Safety: The presence of the ORBB made patients feel safer and more confident about having surgery (&ldquo;put me at a lot more ease,&rdquo; &ldquo;makes me feel a lot more comfortable&rdquo;) because they felt it showed the institution was committed to improving surgical care. However, our stakeholders expressed concern that surgeons and staff would &ldquo;feel pressured or feel like somebody is looking over their shoulder&rdquo; and this might contribute to intraoperative errors.

 

(3) Education: Our stakeholders felt the ORBB was valuable as a teaching tool, particularly &ldquo;for training residents or those &hellip; looking to get into surgery.&rdquo;

 

(4) Data Access and Control: Regarding legal and ethical aspects of the ORBB, stakeholders felt that it was important for patients or their legal representatives to be able to access and review the ORBB data if there were complications from surgery. They also expressed concerns about their ability to easily do so (&ldquo;am I going to have to battle the institution to get the recording?&rdquo;). Additionally, they questioned data ownership (&ldquo;who owns the rights to the video?&rdquo;), how patient confidentiality would be maintained, and whether the informed consent process for the ORBB was fully transparent.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Overall, our patient stakeholders enthusiastically supported use of the ORBB to enhance institutional accountability and education. They expressed reservations about legal/ethical aspects of data management, but stressed their willingness to work with us on these matters to maximize the potential benefits from the technology.

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>Singapore General Hospital, Department Of Surgery, Singapore, Singapore","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Clear communication around surgical device use is crucial to patient safety. We evaluated the acceptability and utility of the Device Briefing Tool (DBT), a structured communication instrument, as an adjunct to the Surgical Safety Checklist.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: General surgery teams at an academic tertiary referral center were asked to use the DBT in all cases involving a surgical device over a ten-week period. Training for surgeons and nurses in the department suggested using the DBT during the pre-incision time-out, but any time prior to skin incision was considered acceptable. Acceptability, utility, and implementation considerations were assessed using a 16-item survey adapted from a previously validated instrument.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 113 individuals surveyed, 91 responded. Response rates for surgeons and nurses were 70% and 85% respectively. Most surgeons and nurses would want the DBT used for themselves (70% vs 68%, p=0.472). Commonly cited advantages included insight into the team&rsquo;s familiarity with the device (70%), improved teamwork and communication (68%), and confirmation that the device is ready for use (65%). Users also felt that it is unrealistic to review all device safety materials (54%) and that the DBT takes too much time (31%). While 43% noted that the DBT improved efficiency, 16% found it disruptive. Free text responses suggested that the DBT identified deficiencies in device familiarity and training but did not provide a mechanism to correct them. Most respondents rated the DBT as moderately to extremely useful; the greatest utility was in operations using complicated devices (89%), followed by new devices (88%), and devices unfamiliar to nursing staff (85%). Sixty-six percent of respondents preferred to use the DBT during the pre-induction briefing, which allowed time to access training materials, contact device representatives, or otherwise address deficiencies. Interestingly, surgeons felt more prepared to use the DBT after training than nurses (65% vs 32%, p=0.038), but nurses were more likely to feel that they could use the DBT effectively without any training (57% vs 43%, p=0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The DBT was rated highly by both surgeons and nurses. Although the impact on perceived operative efficiency was equivocal, the vast majority of respondents recognized the utility of the tool. Centers interested in implementing the DBT should focus on instances where the device is complex or new to members of the surgical team. The DBT should be carefully timed, and guidance for correcting deficiencies should be provided. Training efforts should prioritize surgeons, but nursing staff would also benefit from dedicated training prior to implementation.

Telehealth has long been thought of as a tool to address patient concerns without the need for in-person visits, but it was not widely used in cancer surgery clinics prior to March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the rapid implementation of telehealth without the benefit of learning from patient or clinician perspectives or from developing and sharing best practices. Our objectives were to describe perceptions of telehealth, current processes used to schedule and conduct telehealth visits, and communication patterns regarding telehealth visits across cancer surgery specialties. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted semi-structured interviews with clinical and administrative staff in gastrointestinal, gynecologic, urologic, and colorectal cancer surgery clinics at a large academic medical center. Participants were asked about their experience using telehealth and their ideas for improvement. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Recurring themes related to perceptions and processes of telehealth care were identified.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Seventeen participants were interviewed including 9 surgeons, 2 nurses, 2 advanced practice providers, and 4 administrative staff. We identified three key themes about the use of telehealth across cancer surgery specialties. First, there were clinical concerns. The need for a physical exam and concerns of misdiagnosis limited the perceived ability to utilize telehealth. Second, clinicians voiced concerns over building relationships and trust with patients through a virtual format. Third were logistical and functionality concerns. This theme included usability challenges, workflow challenges, lack of standard processes for selecting the appropriate visits for telehealth, and financial considerations. While most clinicians were generally satisfied with their current telehealth practices, they communicated needed improvements such as dedicated time, clinic space, and tools (e.g., webcameras) to conduct telehealth visits. The overarching perceived benefit of telehealth was for patients, especially those who live far away or who have mobility challenges and do not have in-person clinic visit needs.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While telehealth has limitations and cannot be used for all cancer surgical visits, there is an ongoing role of telehealth to meet the needs of patients, especially those who live far away. Our future research will explore patient perceptions of telehealth as well as administer the validated Relational Coordination Survey to assess domains for communication (frequency, timeliness, accuracy, and problem solving) and relationships (shared goals, shared knowledge, and mutual respect).

More than 30% of patients experience a complication after major gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. Nearly half of these complications occur post-discharge where the responsibility of monitoring primarily falls on the patient and their caregivers. Patient reported outcomes (PROs) have been proposed as a tool to remotely monitor patients after surgery to identify deviations in recovery and allow for earlier recognition and management of complications. Our objective was to characterize barriers to the practical implementation of PROs as a patient monitoring tool after GI surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted semi-structured interviews with GI surgery patients, surgeons, registered nurses (RNs), and advanced practice providers (APPs). Patients and clinicians were asked to describe their experience using a recently implemented asynchronous PRO monitoring system in three surgical oncology clinics. We developed a codebook inductively. Research team dyads independently coded transcripts using the constant comparative approach and differences were reconciled by consensus. We identified themes related to barriers to PRO use as a monitoring tool.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 10 patients and 5 clinicians participated in individual interviews. We identified 4 overarching themes regarding barriers to the use of PROs as a monitoring tool after GI surgery: functionality, workflow, meaningfulness, and actionability (Table 1). PRO system functionality, for example, refers to patients and clinicians reporting the need for a system that is usable and meets their technologic needs and limitations. The workflow theme represents that patients need to better understand the process for completing questionnaires and clinicians need a defined process to access and use PRO data in the electronic medical record. The meaningfulness theme demonstrates how patients and clinicians need to believe that PROs are an important part of postoperative care and provide meaningful insight about recovery. The fourth theme was actionability of PRO data. For example, patients want feedback on their own data and clinicians need to know which scores were actionable and how to address patient needs presented by PROs.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We identified four key barriers to the implementation of a remote PRO monitoring tool after GI surgery. Effective implementation of PROs in surgery should focus on building a user-centered system which addresses the needs of patients and clinicians.

Discrimination in healthcare impacts the patient experience and may contribute to worse outcomes, but its measurement is currently limited. Consumer reviews of healthcare, such as Yelp, provide a window into real world opinions of healthcare facilities, which have been shown to influence healthcare decisions and correlate with outcomes. We performed a qualitative study of consumer reviews to determine their role as a potential source of information for use in the measurement of discrimination in hospital-based care delivery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Yelp reviews of 100 randomly selected hospitals between January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020 were collected. Based on the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS), a widely accepted nine-item questionnaire measuring discrimination, we identified 31 keywords related to discrimination. Natural language processing was used to identify reviews potentially capturing discrimination using these keywords. Five members of the research team used a modified grounded theory approach to create a codebook of recurrent themes based on a subset of the reviews. After coders achieved an inter-rater reliability kappa score of 0.70 in the subset, the remaining reviews were coded in dyads using the codebook. The final inter-rater reliability kappa score was 0.78.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Over the study time frame, there were 11,367 reviews associated with 100 randomly selected hospitals. Natural language processing identified 3,218 reviews that contained at least one of the 31 keywords potentially referencing concepts related to discrimination. Through manual iterative exploration of those reviews, the research team identified 190 references of discrimination across five coded themes: individual, institutional, clinical, non-clinical, and internalized discrimination. Most acts of discrimination occurred in clinical spaces (47.9%) and were perpetrated by individuals (38.9%). See table for example quotes.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer reviews to identify the occurrence of discrimination within hospitals. Qualitative analysis methodologies allowed for a better understanding of how healthcare consumers perceive and report discrimination. Future work to correlate these findings with objective hospital outcomes can help to create healthcare-specific metrics of discrimination.

While various surgical subspecialties have evaluated the trends in OPP within their field, a look at OPP across a surgical department has yet to be performed. Our objective was to describe OPP trends within a department of surgery at a large academic institution.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A list of surgeons within the department of surgery at an academic quaternary referral center was compiled. The OPP data for these surgeons was queried for January 2020 through December 2020 to assess payments from industry. Payments were classified as general payments and research payments. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In one department, 101 surgeons from eight different divisions of surgery were queried, of which 55 (54.5%) received funding. The department received $381,024 in funding, with 57.0% ($217,312) from general payments and 43.0% ($163,712) from research funding (Table 1). Amongst the surgeons receiving funding, 20.0% received payments less than $100, 38.2% received payments of $100 to $999, 27.3% received payments of $1,000 to $9,999, and 14.5% received payments of $10,000 to $99,999. The range of payments was $0 to $98,185. The median was $21 (interquartile range: $0 to $305), and the mean &plusmn; SD was $3,773 &plusmn; $13,306. The highest funding by division was Gastrointestinal Surgery ($165,704), followed by Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery ($81,408), and Vascular Surgery ($71,963). &ldquo;Education&rdquo; and &ldquo;Compensation for services other than consulting, including serving as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continuing education program&rdquo; were the highest payment categories for nature of payment.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Among surgeons within a single institution, nearly half received no payments from industry. Payments were less than $999 in over half of the surgeons receiving funding. The majority of the $381,024 received by the department was given to only 15% of the surgeons. The concentration of this funding to a small subset of individuals raises the potential risk for conflicts of interest. Transparency created by OPP can help departments identify and assess this risk allowing departments the opportunity to prevent any misconceptions with patients or the community it serves.

In order to bring new technologies from bench to bedside appropriate understanding and training of surgeons is essential. Industry utilizes various methods to help promote understanding their devices. The purpose of this study is to ascertain payments to general surgeons from industry and compare them to various surgical specialties utilizing the most recent Sunshine Act database.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We analyzed payment trends using Physician Payment Sunshine Act (PPSA) data (January 2017-December 2017) to assess industry payments made to surgeons of various surgical specialties over four years published in the Open-Payments-Program website.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In 2017, $700,429,189 was paid to 80,267 surgeons; the median (interquartile range [IQR]) was $300 (90-1,1410). General surgeons collectively received 46,079,364 paid to 17,092 general surgeons, their median (IQR) was $214 (65-1,018). The highest paid general surgeon received $3,364,343. The highest paid surgical specialty was orthopedic surgery that received $422,701,734 paid to 22,928 orthopedic surgeons, their median (IQR) was $471 (115-2,444). The lowest paid surgical specialty was pediatric surgery $456,841 paid to 356 pediatric surgeons, their median (IQR) was $82 (28-182). Per surgeon, the highest median (IQR) was paid to cardiothoracic surgeons $757 (170-2,650) who collectively received $49,983,631 paid to 3,698 cardiothoracic surgeons. Out of sixteen different surgical specialties, general surgeons received the third highest amount of total payments and represented 21% of the total aggregate payments made to surgeons. The analysis per surgeon demonstrated that general surgeons received the tenth highest payments of the sixteen different surgical specialties. In comparison, urologists who utilize minimally invasive devices as well received the fourth highest number of payments at $33,811,589 and had a median (IQR) of $523 (166-1,324)


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The PSSA data demonstrates that per surgeon, general surgeons received lower median payments in comparison to other surgical specialties. General surgeons were ranked at the tenth highest recipients of sixteen surgical specialties. As advances are made in the field of minimally invasive and endoscopic surgery, comparing this field&rsquo;s payments to other surgical specialties is beneficial to understand the amount of monetary exchange across all specialties nationally.

Below-knee amputation (BKA) operations can be performed by General Surgeons (GS), Orthopedic Surgeons (OS) and Vascular Surgeons (VS). This retrospective study looks at post-operative complication rate, mortality and prolonged length of stay after a BKA and compares the outcomes among the three specialties.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Adult patients who underwent a BKA were identified from the 2016 &ndash; 2018 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) database. Patient characteristics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, BMI, comorbidities, frailty index, anesthesia type, emergency cases, wound class and postoperative diagnosis were collected for the three surgical specialties. Statistical data for orthopedic and vascular BKA cases were then compared with GS cases using logistic regression analysis. Outcomes included complication rate, mortality and length of hospital stay.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 6,744 BKA cases identified for this study. VS had the highest volume of BKA with 60.2% of the cases, compared to GS at 21.8% and OS at 18.1%. Majority of amputations were male (69.9%) and white (62.6%) among all three specialties. Patients requiring BKA were likely to be diabetic (71.2%), have hypertension requiring medication (78.2%), current smokers (28.4%), and be overweight with a median BMI of 28.16. At the conclusion of the cases, 55.3% were clean wounds, 37.2% contaminated/infected and 7.5% clean/contaminated. Overall mortality rate was 2.4%, and 39.2% had complications. 

The three groups were similar in terms of age, gender, race, BMI. 5.0% of GS patients had severe frailty compared to OS (3.9%) and in VS (3.7%, p&lt;0.001). OS had significantly higher rates of emergency cases (17.1% vs. 10% for GS and 7.3% for VS, p&lt;0.001), and worse wound classification (46.4% vs. 41.4% for GS and 33.0% for VS, p&lt;0.001). PVD was notably higher in VS (44.9% vs. 32.4% for GS and 17.0% for OS, p&lt;0.001). Of all the complications, bleeding requiring transfusions accounted for the highest amount with 20.5% and was highest in the VS group (22.6% vs. 19.1% for GS vs.15.3% for OS, p&lt;0.001). Deep incisional SSI accounted for 2.4% of complications with the highest occurring in the GS group (3.2%) and lowest found in the OS group (1.7%, p=0.031). Amputations performed by OS had lower rates of overall complications at 32.9%, compared to VS (41.1%) and GS (39.3%, &lt;0.001).

Compared to GS, VS was more likely to have a prolonged length of stay (OR 1.467, 95% CI 1.288-1.670) while OS was less likely (OR 0.681, 95% CI 0.571-0.811). OS had a lower risk of complications (OR 0.815, 95% CI 0.682-0.975). Mortality was not significantly different among the three specialties.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

There are less complications when orthopedic surgery performs an amputation. There are opportunities for operative result improvement by collaboration among surgical subspecialties.

According to the 2019 AAMC record of active physicians, 78% of general surgeons are male and 22% are female. However, medical school classes are currently majority female (53.6% of matriculants in 2020), and increasing numbers of women are becoming surgeons and achieving high level positions within surgical departments, including at UCSD. Despite this, the presence of gender-based disparities in the perioperative arena are often cited. The aim of this study is to gauge the prevalence of these sentiments using a survey tool and to ultimately use these results to guide discussion and policy-making to abolish gender disparities.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An anonymous 16 question multiple-choice survey was designed in which participants were asked to provide the gender they identify with, followed by a series of questions in which they were asked whether they felt that surgeons of their gender experience access to various perioperative resources equally compared to other surgeons at this institution. The survey ended with an opportunity to provide additional commentary or insights. The survey was sent electronically via email to all surgical attendings at the study institution. Participation was voluntary. Descriptive statistics were performed for data analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 47 surgeons responded to the survey. 24 reported identifying as female (51% of respondents), 20 (42.6% of respondents) as male, one as non-binary, one as other, and one as &ldquo;irrelevant&rdquo; (2.1% each). The majority of participants felt that all genders were &ldquo;equally likely&rdquo; to have the same perioperative experience (Table 1). However, participants who identified as female were more likely than males to report feelings that surgeons of their gender are less likely to have access to perioperative resources compared to other surgeons at UCSD, and more likely to experience case delays or &ldquo;bumps.&rdquo; Preliminary EPIC/OPTIME data of operating room key performance indicators at an institutional level did not reveal a gender difference, however detailed analysis is forthcoming.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this study, surgeons who self-identified as female were more likely to report feeling gender inequities or disparities in the perioperative setting. Future directions include additional analysis of objective measures in the electronic medical records (EPIC/OPTIME) to corroborate or dispute the sentiments. Together with the survey results, we hope to address and abolish feelings and/or possible presence of gender disparities at this institution and provide subjective and objective tools for other institutions potentially facing gender equity-based challenges.

Transitions of care are known to be a vulnerable period in a patient&rsquo;s hospital course. Analyzing methods to improve transitions between medical providers can lead to more effective practices for improved patient care and safety. The significance of a standardized and thorough handoff was most recently highlighted during the past year&rsquo;s pandemic. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual warm handoff protocol for end-of-service transitions in hospitalized patients to improve patient safety.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A qualitative analysis of surveys from general surgery residents, ranging from PGY1 to PGY5, at a university-based General Surgery residency was performed. Three surveys were distributed: a pre-intervention survey, a survey after three months of standard handoff methods and a post-intervention survey after another 3 months of the warm handoff protocol. For the first 3 months of the study, all residents continued with their standard handoff methods. For the second 3 months, all residents implemented the warm handoff protocol which involved the use of a secure video conferencing platform approved by the institution. Separate surveys were also provided at the same intervals to nurses and attendings to determine the perceived impact of the protocol on patient care.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 14/29 residents completed all three surveys. No nurses or attending physicians completed all three surveys. The pre-survey revealed 96.4% of the 29 residents believed end-of-care transitions were a vulnerable time for patients with 89.3% believing warm handoffs would be safer than current handoff practices. Responses were slightly higher for both attendings and nurses. Of the 14 residents who completed the final survey, 92.9% believed warm handoffs were more time-consuming. There were 78.5% who believed warm handoffs were beneficial for patients and 71.4% who believed warm handoffs can lessen patient complications. There was no correlation (p &gt; 0.05) between the residents&rsquo; responses to the pre-survey regarding their initial perception of warm handoffs and their final answers in the post-intervention survey.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Implementation of a virtual warm handoff protocol is perceived to be beneficial for patient safety in theory and in practice based on residents&rsquo; responses to a three-part survey over a 6-month period. While the warm handoff protocol was believed to have been more time consuming, more than half the residents believed the protocol to be beneficial for patient safety in both the pre-intervention and post-intervention surveys. The study was limited due to a lack of participation in the protocol and the surveys. This can be remedied in a future study by ensuring that the residents are able to complete handoffs during protected time as well as expanding this to a multicenter study. Additional studies analyzing patient outcomes will be needed to assess the impact of this strategy.

Anastomotic leak after sigmoid colon resection increases complications, mortality, and length of hospital stay. The current data regarding leak rates following high ligation (taken at origin) of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) is mixed and has been reported as high as 15%. A recent meta-analysis showed a small but significant increase in leak rate when high ligation of the IMA was performed.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients undergoing elective sigmoid colon resection via low anterior resection or sigmoid colectomy by a single colorectal surgeon between January 2017 and June 2021. High ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery was routinely attempted independently of a cancer diagnosis. IRB approval was obtained. Fisher exact test was used to compare the groups and a statistical significance was defined as p &lt; 0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The total number of patients reviewed was 143, with a mean age of 58 years old. There were 73 males (51%) and 70 females (49%). Twenty-seven percent of patients were ASA II and 66% were ASA III. Average BMI was 30.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with a standard deviation of +/- 7.06 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. There were 110 minimally invasive procedures and 33 open resections. Eighteen patients (12.6%) had an ileostomy performed during the initial operation. High ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery was performed in 97 patients (67.8%) vs 46 patients (32.2%) in which high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery was not performed. Leak rate in all patients included was 0.7% (n = 1). There was no statistically significant difference in leak rates between groups. In the high ligation group, there was 1 anastomotic leak (1%) versus zero when a high ligation was not performed (p = 1). When patients with a loop ileostomy are excluded, the overall leak rate was 0.8% (1/125 patients). A total of 2 patients (1.4%) required a reoperation within 30 days (1 &ndash; anastomotic leak, high ligation group; 1 &ndash; evisceration, non-ligation group). There were no mortalities within 30 days.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
High ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery is non-inferior to low ligation regarding leak rates after elective sigmoid colon resection. High ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery in patients undergoing sigmoid resection is non-inferior to low ligation regarding mortality or reoperation rates.

Yet, it remains unclear whether overall volume reflects hospital experience with cancer care. We aimed to examine the correlation between the volume of patients undergoing oncologic and non-oncologic operations and depict the relationship between total and oncologic surgical volume in a colorectal cancer model.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who underwent elective colorectal resections in Florida from 2016-2019 using discharge data. We identified patients undergoing oncologic and non-oncologic resections at each hospital using ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficients were calculated to compare the hospital volume of oncologic and non-oncologic patients and in subsets by site of resection (colon vs. rectum). Total and oncologic surgical volume were compared graphically. High volume hospitals were defined as those performing more than 150 colorectal resections per year, or 600 during the 4-year period.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 41,843 patients identified in 136 hospitals, 50.6% of patients underwent surgery for colorectal cancer and 49.4% had surgery for a non-oncologic indication. The distribution of oncologic and non-oncologic surgery differed across hospitals (Figure). There was a strong positive correlation between oncologic and non-oncologic colorectal patient volumes at the level of the hospital (r=0.87, P&lt;0.001), which remained when restricting operations to those of the colon only (r=0.87, P&lt;0.001) and those of the rectum (r=0.79, P&lt;0.001). The percent of oncologic cases at the hospital level ranged from 25.7% to 86.8%. Among low volume hospitals, overall volume did not always reflect oncologic volume. For example, one hospital with 132 colorectal resections in 4 years had a 4-year oncologic volume of 47 cases (35.6%, Dot &ldquo;1&rdquo; on Figure), while another hospital with the same resection volume had 111 oncologic cases (84.1%, Dot &ldquo;2&rdquo; on Figure). High volume hospitals had high oncologic volume even if the percent of oncologic cases was low. For example, a hospital performing 810 colorectal resections over 4 years had a relatively low proportion of oncologic patients (42.1%); yet, it still treated 341 oncologic cases (Dot &ldquo;3&rdquo; on Figure).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Oncologic and non-oncologic volume are strongly correlated, demonstrating that hospitals with high overall colorectal surgery volume also have experience with cancer care. Among low volume hospitals, however, experience with cancer care varied. Therefore, patients seeking colorectal cancer care at lower volume hospitals should investigate cancer experience prior to settling on a treatment location.

Shen<sup>1</sup>, R. P. Kiran<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, Colorectal Surgery, New York City, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Previous literature related to postoperative outcomes after laparoscopic vs. open ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is primarily based on small numbers of patients from single institutions. The aim of this study is to evaluate these outcomes in a large number of patients using propensity score matching (PSM). 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The American College of Surgeons- National Surgical Quality Improvement Program proctectomy-targeted data files (2016-2019) were reviewed to identify patients who underwent an IPAA creation. The impact of surgical approach on operative and postoperative outcomes, particularly in-hospital mortality, surgical site infection, and anastomotic leak, were evaluated. 1:1 (laparoscopic:open) propensity score matching (PSM) on all patient characteristics was used to obtain matched groups. Fisher&rsquo;s exact/Chi-squared tests were used to compare outcomes between groups. A Bonferroni correction was applied to the outcomes, in order to adjust for Type 1 error, with a p-value of 0.0031 representing statistical significance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
1802 patients were identified, with 1001 patients (55.5%) in the laparoscopic group and 801 patients (44.5%) in the open group. PSM yielded 702 patients in each matched group. Median operative time was significantly longer for laparoscopic IPAA (278 vs 218.5 minutes, p &lt; 0.001). Laparoscopic IPAA patients were less likely to develop superficial and deep SSIs (3.0% vs 6.6% p = 0.003). There were no significance differences in in-hospital mortality (0.4% vs 0.0%, p=0.249), anastomotic leak (4.0% vs 3.3%, p=0.568), organ-space SSI (6.7% vs 6.6%, p=1) or reoperation (5.7% vs 4.0%, p=0.171) between groups. Length of stay (LOS) was significantly lower after laparoscopic IPAA (5.0 vs 6.0 days, p=0.004). There were no significant differences in other postoperative complications, including cardiac events, CVA, renal failure, and sepsis, between groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
These large data from a national database suggest that when matched for other confounding variables, laparoscopic IPAA is associated with reduced length of stay and superficial and deep SSIs when compared to open IPAA. Other surgical complications, including in-hospital mortality and anastomotic leak, are similar. Given the recovery benefit of the laparoscopic approach and the reduced SSI, which are a significant burden on the health system, laparoscopy should be the method of choice for the majority of patients undergoing IPAA.

Cataldo<sup>1</sup>, E. Messaris<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Colorectal Surgery Division, Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The role of robotic surgery in rectal cancer remains controversial. Randomized clinical trials have found no difference in oncological outcomes or postoperative recovery. Adoption of robotic surgery in rectal cancer continues. The goal of our study is to compare Institutional postoperative and oncologic outcomes between laparoscopic and robotic surgery for rectal cancer. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective cohort study was performed using Institutional data from a tertiary care center over a six-year period. Patients with rectal cancer undergoing laparoscopic or robotic resection were included. Open or converted to open cases were excluded. All procedures were performed by experienced surgeons with more than 50 laparoscopic and 50 robotic pelvic dissections. Demographic characteristics, preoperative treatment, perioperative and oncologic outcomes were recorded. Surgical pathology reports were reviewed for specimen macro and microscopic characteristics. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 149 patients underwent rectal cancer resection either with laparoscopic (n=44) or robotic (n=105) approach. The groups did not differ in basic demographics or presurgical treatment. Operative time, length of stay, readmission rate, and resected lymph nodes were comparable between groups (Table 1). Disease involving radial margin was found in 2.3% of patients that underwent laparoscopic surgery and 9.6% in robotic cases (p=0.175). Only robotic cases were found to have positive distal margins. Distal margin positivity happened early in the study cohort, while radial margin positivity remained stable over time. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Laparoscopic and robotic surgery for rectal cancer are comparable, with similar oncologic and surgical outcomes. Even in experienced hands, circumferential margin resection remains challenging. Larger studies investigating radial margin positivity should be performed to continue monitoring due to consistently high radial margin positivity rates.

Despite the importance of patient reported outcomes (PROs) in evaluating outcomes following colorectal surgery, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are rarely collected outside of clinical research studies. Systematically collecting PROMs before regular colorectal surgery clinic visits could allow for better tracking of patients&rsquo; overall health and response to treatment across visits. Therefore, we designed and implemented a quality improvement initiative with the goal of collecting tailored PROMs at our institution&rsquo;s colorectal surgery clinic.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was a mixed methods, quality improvement project at a large academic medical center. Patients were given one or more PROMs to complete prior to their colorectal surgery clinic visit. Patients completed their PROMs through our institution&rsquo;s online patient portal or in the waiting room on a clinic-provided electronic tablet. Clinic staff were trained to implement in-clinic electronic PROM collection. Patients were administered one or more of the following PROMs: the PROMIS 10 questionnaire, the Quality of Recovery 9 questionnaire, the EORTC Quality of Life in Colorectal Cancer questionnaire, the Short Quality of Life in Inflammatory Bowel Disease questionnaire, or the Diverticulitis Quality of Life questionnaire. Completion rates both overall and for each survey were calculated. Unstructured interviews with stakeholders including the front desk staff, intake nurses, attending physicians, and patients were conducted at 2 and 12 weeks after project launch to identify and address potential barriers to implementation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Overall, patients completed 3440 of 3784 (90.9%) administered PROMs. The completion rate ranged from 92.8% in the first month to 87% in the current (fifth) month. Completion rates of individual PROMs are detailed in the accompanying table. In a qualitative analysis, interviews with patients revealed high levels of satisfaction with the method of PROM collection. Ancillary clinic staff felt that the process was streamlined, but occasionally interfered with their workflow. Attending physicians described the potential benefits of collecting PROMs, but admitted they rarely used them during clinic visits.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The electronic collection of PROMs in the colorectal surgery clinic of a large academic medical center is feasible and can result in high PROM completion rates. The data collected from this quality improvement initiative has the potential to improve surgical decision making but will require additional attending physician education. Our experience collecting PROMs through this quality improvement initiative can serve as a template for other colorectal surgery clinics interested in collecting and analyzing PRO data.

Inadequate lymph node harvest (LNH; &lt;12 nodes) in colon cancer resection is considered a high-risk feature for lymphatic spread, due to the possibility of a sampling error. This higher risk has been used to justify the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy in early T stage tumors. The efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with T3N0 staging with inadequate LNH has been established in prior studies, but there are no reported data regarding patients with T1 or T2 tumors. This study aimed to determine whether patients with stage 1 colon cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy due to inadequate LNH derived any survival benefit.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used for this retrospective study. Patients diagnosed with T1N0 and T2N0 colon cancer from 2004 to 2016 were evaluated and separated into adequate and inadequate LNH groups. Patients who had rectal cancer, who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or who had missing regional LNH data, were excluded. Descriptive statistics with t-tests and chi-square tests were used to compare demographic characteristics for inadequate LNH patients with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, adjusted for key covariates, was used to estimate prognostic factors for overall survival while accounting for potential confounders. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 139,857 patients with T1N0/T2N0 were identified, with 39,624 (28.3%) patients having inadequate LNH. Among those who had inadequate LNH, 602 patients had adjuvant chemotherapy (1.52%) and 39,022 patients received no adjuvant treatment (98.5%). Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had lower mean age (62.8 vs 68.3 years, p&lt;0.01), higher uninsured rate (3.65% vs 1.69%, p&lt;0.01), higher low-income rate (16.0% vs 12.6%, p=0.01), lower Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (0.34 vs 0.46, p&lt;0.01), and higher rate of poorly differentiated tumor (9.30% vs 5.45%, p&lt;0.01). Multivariate Cox regression modeling showed that age&gt;65 years (HR=3.62, p&lt;0.01), male sex (HR=1.11, p&lt;0.01), low income (HR=1.21, p&lt;0.01), T2 stage (HR=1.23, p&lt;0.01), and CCI (HR=1.66, p&lt;0.01) were associated with significantly worse overall survival. Administration of adjuvant chemotherapy did not show significant benefit to the overall survival rate with a hazard ratio of 0.94 (p=0.42).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve the survival rate of colon cancer for T1N0/T2N0 patients with inadequate LNH. Inadequate LNH does not appear to be justification for adjuvant chemotherapy in this patient population.

Ghalyaie<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>HCA Healthcare/USF Morsani College of Medicine GME, Surgery, Hudson, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: While obesity is well known to negatively impact a variety of clinical outcomes in open surgeries, whether it has the same deleterious effect on laparoscopic and robotic surgery outcomes is less clear. The current study sought to critically review the existing literature on the impact of obesity on clinical and operative outcomes of laparoscopic (LCRS) and robotic colorectal cancer surgery (RCRS).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A comprehensive MEDLINE, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials was conducted. Key words searched included colorectal cancer, obesity, laparoscopic and/or robotic surgery, and clinical outcome. Patients were categorized as non-obese (BMI&lt;30) and obese (BMI&ge;30). Outcomes analyzed included operative time, post-operative ileus, anastomotic leak, wound infection, conversion rate, and other post-operative complications.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 13 studies involving 4,187 patients undergoing either LCRS or RCRS were identified. Among these patients there were 1,129 obese patients and 3,058 non-obese patients. With respect to LCRS outcomes, obesity resulted in increased operative times (+13.731 min (-5.090-32.551, p=0.153)), post-op ileus (1.400 (0.630-3.110, p=0.409)), anastomotic leaks (1.309 (0.678-2.526, p=0.422)), wound infection rates (2.361 (0.284-19.661, p=0.427)), conversion rates (1.760 (0.735-4.213, p=0.204)), and post-operative complications (1.690 (1.143-2.498, p=0.008)); however, only post-operative complications reached statistical significance. In regards to RCRS patients, obesity results in increased operative times (+13.252 min (-9.309-35.813, p=0.250)), post-op ileus (1.555 (0.938-2.577, p=0.087)), wound infection rates (1.321 (0.600-2.911, p=0.490)), conversion rate (1.139 (0.645-2.012, p=0.654)), post-operative complications (1.541 (1.175-2.019, p=0.002)); however, only post-operative complications reached statistical significance. Anastomotic leaks (0.999 (0.570-1.750, p=0.997)) remained the same in obese vs non-obese patients undergoing RCRS.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery (LCRS and RCRS) in obese patients results in a longer operative time, higher conversion rate and significantly higher post-operative complications than in non-obese patients. Obesity is associated with higher intra-abdominal pressures, a large and heavy omentum, thick mesenteries, and hypertrophic epiploicae. These factors negatively impact operative field exposure and tissue dissection. Familiar landmarks of the surgical anatomy are obliterated by fat deposition leading to more challenging and time-consuming operations. Further studies are needed to emphasize on better stratification of the obese population with colorectal disease as candidates for laparoscopic and robotic procedures.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Clinical variables (v=81) at index admission from patients (&gt;18 yo) who underwent colectomy surgery were retrieved from a Health System warehouse retrospectively (Jan. 2010 to July 2016), and prospectively (Aug- 2016 to Dec-2020) under IRB approved protocols. While surrogates for Quality (Observed/Expected) included post-operative complications (PC), length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission (RA), patient satisfaction index (PS), and Textbook cases (TB), surrogates of cost included total hospital charge accrued for admission/re-admission (TC), and reimbursement index (RI, O/E).

Chao<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>New York Presbyterian Hospital, Department Of Colorectal Surgery, Flushing, NY, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>New York Presbyterian Hospital, Surgery, Flushing, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
In patients who undergo elective colorectal resection for cancer, low preoperative nutrition status, a modifiable risk factor, has been associated with complications such as anastomotic dehiscence, increased length of stay, and decreased survival (cancer-specific, disease-free, and overall). Nutritional prehabilitation has been shown to improve outcomes. To encourage compliance with nutritional supplementation (NS), which arrives as a week&rsquo;s supply of either Ensure&trade; or Ensure Surgery&trade; in a bulky and heavy box, our institution initiated a delivery program. In a largely elderly, metropolitan, and ethnically heterogeneous cohort undertaking complex preoperative preparation, we sought to assess if these changes resulted in improved access. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Retrospective study of patients undergoing elective colectomy at a single institution between January 2015 and January 2021. A hospital-specific colorectal ERAS protocol which includes NS was initiated in early 2017 and in full practice by end of 2017. Preoperative demographics such as age, gender, and race were included. Neighborhood statistics based on zip code and census tracts were obtained by publicly available data from the United States Census and the Center for Disease Control. Use of preoperative NS was analyzed for change in hospital length of stay, 30-day complications, and readmissions. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

605 patients (270 female) were studied. Of the NS cohort (n=276), average age was 63.6 years (std 14.0), of the non-NS cohort (n=329), average age was 64.3 years (std 13.6). Other preoperative patient characteristics including age, gender, ASA class, disseminated cancer were not predictive of NS use (p&gt;0.05). Of those who took NS, 204 patients received delivery and 76 opted for pickup. There were no baseline demographic differences between patients who chose delivery over pickup, including differences in neighborhood characteristics such as median income and social vulnerability index. Although albumin &le;3.5 g/dL was associated with significantly longer hospital length of stay (LOS) (8.1 days, stdev 8.0 vs 4.5 days, stdev 3.8, p&lt;0.001), NS use, even in the low albumin cohort, was not associated with change in hospital LOS, superficial surgical site infection, or 30-day readmissions (p&gt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

At this time, there is no difference in outcomes between the NS and non-NS cohort, which may reflect adequate preoperative nutrition or low compliance. Among patients who receive NS, delivery is a popular option and is accessible for patients of many different backgrounds. Further investigation is needed to determine which patients would benefit from targeted preoperative nutrition.

Garwe<sup>1</sup>, K. T. Morris<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Oklahoma College Of Medicine, Department Of Surgery, Oklahoma City, OK, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among young patients has increased in the last 20 years. These patients often present with more aggressive tumor biology, including high grade, aggressive histology and at a higher stage of disease. However, it is unclear if age &lt;50 is an independent factor for shorter overall survival in CRC patients. Our objective was to determine if younger age at diagnosis was associated with worse overall survival among patients with no comorbidities.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This study used the National Cancer Data Base (2004-2016), retrospectively reviewing patients who underwent surgical resection for CRC. Patients were limited to those without co-morbidities. The primary outcome was overall survival. Multivariable Cox regression was used to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (HR). Patients were grouped by age (&lt;35 years old, 36-54 years old, and 55 to 74 years old. Variables adjusted in the models were sex, age, tumor location, histology, grade, and chemotherapy. A subgroup analysis was performed of patients where use of adjuvant chemotherapy was left to provider discretion (Stage II T3N0 without high risk features).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Younger patients have improved overall survival as compared to older patients at a lower stage of disease (I and II) after adjusting for tumor location, sex, histology, stage, and systemic chemotherapy. The largest survival difference was noted in 56-74 years old patients as compared to patients &lt;35 years old, HR 2.707 (CI 2.45,2.99) in stage I and II disease. As stage increased the survival gap between younger and older patients decreased. For stage III disease, 36-55 years old versus &lt;35 years old HR 1.009 (CI 0.95,1.07) as compare to HR 1.47 (CI 1.39,1.56) for patients 56-74 years old as compared to &lt;35 years old. The gap was nearly eliminated in stage IV disease 36-55 years old as compared to &lt;35 years old HR 0.98 (CI 0.93-1.03) and 56-74 years old as compared to &lt;35 years old patient HR 1.21 (CI 1.15,1.27). Within the subgroup of low-risk Stage II patients who received chemotherapy based on provider judgment, the &le;35 years old had significantly better overall survival compared to the older patients; HR 2.1 (CI 1.3, 3.5) for 36-55 years old and HR 4.5 (CI 2.7, 7.5) for 56-74 years old.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Younger patients (&lt;35 years old) have improved overall survival at a lower stage of disease, likely reflecting death due to non-cancer causes. This independent survival benefit is eliminated at a higher stage of disease, suggesting cancer specific survival is likely not related to age at diagnosis. Stage II patients who receive chemotherapy at the discretion of their providers, have step wise decreased in survival as age increases. In this study age did not impact the overall survival of patients of CRC in late-stage disease.

Anal adenocarcinoma is a rare disease with a poor prognosis. Currently, staging and treatment modalities for anal adenocarcinoma mimic those of rectal adenocarcinoma. However, given the rarity of the diseases, there is limited data regarding outcomes of these treatment modalities. The goal of our study is to provide an updated analysis of the survival outcomes of anal adenocarcinoma as compared to rectal adenocarcinoma.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single-institution retrospective review was performed on all patients diagnosed with anal canal adenocarcinoma between 1995 and 2020 at a single tertiary care institution. Nearest-neighbor matching based on age, sex, and stage was performed to obtain a cohort of a rectal adenocarcinoma for comparison. Data collected included patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment modalities, date of last contact, vital status, and, if applicable, date of recurrence identification. Exclusion criteria included other histologies, concurrent malignancies, and stage IV disease. We used Chi-square and Fishers exact test to examine differences in categorical variables by cancer site. Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare overall survival by cancer site.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Total of 18 patients with stages I-III anal adenocarcinoma were identified and 31 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma were matched. All patients were white and non-Hispanic. On univariate analysis, there was no statistically significant differences in age, sex, pathologic stage, and reception of neo-adjuvant treatment. The Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated worse 5-year overall survival in patients with anal adenocarcinoma compared with rectal adenocarcinoma (44.40% vs. 82.90%, p = 0.024) (Figure 1). Similarly, in the subgroup of patients who received neo-adjuvant treatment, we observed worse 5-year overall survival in patients with anal adenocarcinoma compared to those with rectal adenocarcinoma (31.82% vs. 90.34%, p = 0.004)

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Anal adenocarcinoma is an aggressive disease with a worse overall survival compared to rectal adenocarcinoma, even in the setting of neo-adjuvant treatment. This highlights the likely unique and aggressive nature of the anal adenocarcinoma and the need to redefine current staging and treatment strategies for this rare disease.

Despite being a well-established form of treatment, its lack of availability to certain populations is of concern. Black patients are known to have a higher incidence and mortality rate from colon cancer compared to all other races. Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate the incidence of colonic stent placement in various groups to determine if disparities exist. Our hypothesis was that Black patients with colon cancer were less likely to receive stents than White patients. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Deidentified patient datum from 2013-2018 with a diagnosis of colon cancer located between the transverse and sigmoid colon was obtained using the Cerner Health Facts<sup>&reg;</sup> Database and ICD 9/10 codes. CPT codes to discern whether the patient had surgery or stent placement within a year of diagnosis were then added. The 26 patients with both were excluded from our study. A univariable logistic regression model including race (Black, White or other*), sex, geographic region, urban vs. rural, and insurance status compared stent placement to surgery. Subsequently, a multivariable logistic regression model regressed these treatments on the interaction between race with geographic region, and race with urban vs. rural status. All results are shown as odds ratio (OR [95% confidence interval]).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 3772 patients analyzed, 3562 underwent surgery and 210 received a stent. There were 2761, 432 and 514 patients in the White, Black and other categories respectively. Approximately 5% of White, 11.6% of Black, and 2.5% of those classified as other received stents. (Figure). Univariable analysis showed patients received stents more often if they were male (OR=1.35 [1.02,1.8]), Black (OR=2.38 [1.69,3.34]), living in the Northeast (OR=1.9 [1.25,2.87]), or from an urban area (OR=1.48 [1.06,2.08]). Multivariable analysis demonstrated increased stent placement compared to surgery in Black patients residing in the South (OR=5.57 [2.35,14.20]) or in those living an urban setting (OR=8.69 [3.13,30.93]). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Overall, a higher proportion of Black patients compared to White patients received stents in lieu of surgery in colon cancer; these findings were more pronounced in the South and in Urban areas. Further studies are warranted to determine the etiology of, and implications for, these disparities in treatment.

Blansfield<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, PA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Geisinger Medical Center, Surgical Oncology, Danville, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Surgical therapy for pancreatic cancer is an essential component of treatment, and a high-quality operation should theoretically lead to high cure rate. The methods used to assess surgical intervention should seek to improve quality in order to maximize curative potential. Evaluated lymph node (ELN) yield has been established as a promising measure because of its positive association with improved cure rates in certain cancers. Prior research has suggested that an ELN of at least 15 has contributed to improvements in survival and staging metrics in pancreatic cancer patients. The aim of this study was to determine what impact a high ELN yield of &ge;15 nodes has on oncological outcomes in a novel pancreatic cancer patient population. The secondary objective was to identify the factors that influenced receipt of higher ELN yield surgeries.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective cohort study was performed on resectable, non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by pancreatectomy from 2004 to 2017 using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). ELN, survival, and perioperative data were collected, and patients with fewer than 15 nodes examined were compared to those who had 15 or more examined for differences in demographic, survival, and perioperative metrics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors associated with an increased ELN. Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors associated with overall survival.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 5,930 patients were included. Fifty-eight percent of patients had 15 or more lymph nodes examined. The high ELN yield group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in 5-year overall survival rates (P&lt;0.004). A high ELN was also associated with improvements in a number of perioperative outcomes including post-operative stay (P&lt;0.0001), 30-day unplanned readmission (P&lt;0.0275), and 90-day mortality (P&lt;0.0006).

This study also looked at associations with higher ELN yields next. Patients who were treated at a Comprehensive Community (HR = 0.792 [95% CI = 0.689-0.910]) or Integrated Network program (HR = 0.661[95% CI = 0.558-0.783]) were less likely to have 15 or more lymph nodes harvested compared to patients treated at Academic Centers. Facilities with a high surgery volume were more likely to conduct high ELN yield surgeries (HR = 2.861[95% CI = 2.359-3.469]) than those with a low volume. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: An ELN yield of 15 or more nodes improves survival and perioperative outcomes in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who receive neoadjuvant therapy. It therefore serves as a robust and practical measure of surgical quality. While harvest disparities exist between facility and therapy types, all centers should seek ELN yields of 15 or more lymph nodes.

This study examines the association of persistent poverty on the diagnosis, surgical resection and survival of patients with three common cancers: non-small cell lung (NSCLC), breast and colorectal cancer. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients with NSCLC (n=163352), breast (n=236956) and colorectal (n=122215) cancer were identified from SEER (2012-2016). County-level poverty proportions were obtained from the American Community Survey (1980-2015). Comparing patients in counties experiencing persistent, current, past and no poverty over time, outcomes included advanced stage at diagnosis (stage III-IV), resection of localized disease (stage I-II) and cancer-specific survival. Hierarchical generalized linear models and accelerated failure time models with Weibull distribution were used, adjusted for region and patient-level age, sex, race, stage and insurance status.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Patients living in persistent poverty were more likely to present with advanced stage disease (NSCLC OR 1.17, 95%CI 1.11-1.23; breast OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.07-1.22; colorectal OR 1.02, 95%CI 0.97-1.08), less likely to undergo surgical resection (NSCLC OR 0.77, 95%CI 0.70-0.84; breast OR 0.86, 95%CI 0.76-0.97; colorectal OR 0.80, 95%CI 0.68-0.95) and had increased cancer-specific mortality (NSCLC HR 1.13, 95%CI 1.10-1.17; breast HR 1.23, 95%CI 1.10-1.38; colorectal HR 1.12, 95%CI 1.05-1.19) as compared to those without poverty. These differences persisted compared to counties classified as current and past poverty.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients in counties experiencing persistent poverty have worse cancer-specific outcomes than patients in other counties, including those experiencing current or past poverty. This work supports investment in these communities to ensure equitable cancer outcomes.

Howard<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of South Alabama, College Of Medicine, Mobile, AL, USA&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>University Of South Alabama, Department Of Surgery, Mobile, AL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer with outcomes correlating with tumor stage. Predictions have been made that COVID pandemic-associated treatment delays could be associated with higher stage presentation and worse prognoses. This study compares melanomas excised before vs. during the pandemic to evaluate pandemic related stage progression and oncologic follow up attendance.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Breslow depth, ulceration, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) positivity of primary melanomas treated at our institution during the COVID pandemic (C) were compared to those from the same period the previous year pre-COVID (PC). The C timeframe started the date the Alabama governor closed nonessential business in the state. We used odds ratios to assess the risk of ulceration, sentinel node positivity, and presenting with a more advanced melanoma (stage II or higher) during C vs PC. We compared Breslow depth using the student&rsquo;s t-test. To assess the pandemic&rsquo;s impact on melanoma follow-up, we compared the proportion of patients diagnosed in 2018 vs. 2019 who attended annual recommended surveillance appointments in 2019 and 2020, respectively. C follow up included in-person and telemedicine visits.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The PC and C cohorts had 124 and 107 patients, respectively. The groups were similar in age at diagnosis, gender, history of cancer, and immune status. When comparing PC to C patients, there was no increase in risk of advanced melanomas (34% vs. 40%, OR: 1.26; 95% CI 0.74-2.16; p = .39) or ulceration (23% vs. 25%, OR: 1.19; 95% CI 0.64-2.20; p = .58). The number of patients in each group who underwent sentinel node biopsy was similar (62% vs. 68%) and there was no difference in positivity rates in PC vs. C patients (19% vs. 15%, OR: 0.73; 95% CI 0.31-1.72; p = .71). Mean Breslow depth was similar in both groups (1.67 vs. 1.91 mm; p = .19). We further divided C patients into early and late groups by 6 month increments. We did not find a difference between the early vs. late C patients in relation to Breslow depth, ulceration or SLNB positivity rates at time of presentation. We did not detect a difference in the proportion of patients who attended annual recommended follow up surveillance after being diagnosed in 2018 vs. 2019 (85% vs. 73%, OR: 2.12; 95% CI 0.72-6.27; p = .17).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patient access and treatment related to melanoma care at an academic tertiary referral cancer center were not associated with worse stage presentation during the COVID pandemic. This suggests that pandemic-related closure of nonessential businesses and health care access precautions to prevent spread of COVID-19 were not associated with delayed diagnosis, treatment or oncologic follow up for melanoma.

Broman<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, School Of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgical Oncology, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The patient burden of melanoma treatment is vast. The purpose of this study is to compare the burden of treatment for a small, but especially complex, subset of melanoma patients with in-transit metastases (ITM). ITM is defined as subcutaneous or cutaneous deposits of melanoma cells that are distinct from the primary site but does not reach the draining nodal basin. ITM represents a heterogenous and aggressive disease process. Current treatments (surgery, systemic, intralesional, radiation, and limb perfusion) are diverse in treatment profile (time, side effects, risk, etc.). There is no current standard of therapy selection for ITM due to the lack of large-cohort comparative studies, thus anticipated burden of care may have a greater impact on therapy selection.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients with in-transit melanoma, without distant metastasis, who had at least one treatment course managed at our institution from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2020 were included in the study. To evaluate the treatment burden of in-transit care, number of clinic visits, number of inpatient hospital days, number of treatment courses, and median distance traveled were gathered and utilized to compare the treatment types. Descriptive statistics were used for patient and disease characteristics. Comparison of treatment burden was done by Wilcoxon rank sum tests and treatment response with chi-squared tests. Thematic analysis was used to characterize factors associated with treatment selection.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 89 patients assessed, 42 met inclusion criteria. Surgery, systemic, intralesional, and radiation therapies were assessed. Limb perfusion was not utilized by any patient in the cohort, and therefore excluded in analysis. Number of in-transit lesions had the greatest impact of first treatment course (p= 0.007). Patients with only 1 in-transit lesion had the highest utilization of surgery as a first-line therapy, while patients with more than 4 lesions had high systemic therapy utilization. Median number of clinic visits for each therapy were: systemic therapy (10 visits), intralesional therapy (5 visits), radiation (4 visits), and surgery (3 visits). Median travel distance for the cohort was 66.5 miles. At a median follow up time of 8.8 months, 52 percent of the cohort had utilized more than one therapy to manage disease and 33 percent had progressed to distant disease. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Burden of care for patients with in-transit melanoma is high and an important aspect of setting expectations of the treatment course for a newly diagnosed patient. Further, burden of care data may aide in patient decision-making of treatment courses that align with personal preferences.

The impact of these delays on the oncologic outcomes of patients with peritoneal surface malignancies (PSM) is unknown. We aim to characterize this impact at our institution.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review at a single, high-volume, academic institution of patients with PSM whose planned oncologic operations were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic and clinicopathologic data were collected. Imaging reports and operative reports were reviewed to assess for evidence of either radiologic or occult progression of disease during the delay. Time to Surgery (TTS) was defined as the number of days from the decision to operate to the actual date of surgery. Descriptive statistics were performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 27 patients were identified, 63% of which were female, and 100% were Caucasian. The median age was 60 years (range 39-84). Fifteen patients had an appendiceal primary histology, 3 each had colorectal and mesothelioma, 2 each had gastric and ovarian, and 1 each had sarcoma and thymoma primaries. While the majority of patients sustained a delay due to triage of non-emergent cases, 2 had operations postponed after they contracted COVID-19. Median TTS was 72 days (range 47-218). During this time, 11 (40.7%) of the 27 patients had evidence of either radiologic progression or occult progression noted at the time of surgery; 2 patients did not have radiology available for review and were thus unevaluable for radiologic progression. Two patients had progressive disease that precluded surgery and 1 was lost to follow up before undergoing surgery. Two operations were aborted due to occult progression noted at the time of surgery. Other impacts of the delays included either initiation or continuation of systemic chemotherapy in 9 patients (33.3%), and additional surgical intervention (repeat staging laparoscopy prior to cytoreduction) in 2 patients (7.4%). During a median follow-up time of 15.7 months, 8 patients (29.6%) died. Of the 8 patients who died, 5 were noted to have evidence of disease progression during the TTS.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Amongst patients with peritoneal surface malignancies, a delay in planned operative intervention had a negative impact on oncologic outcomes including disease progression, resectability, and need for additional interventions such as chemotherapy and repeat procedures. Our understanding of the full and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncologic care will continue to evolve.

Ha<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>The Johns Hopkins University School Of Medicine, Surgery, Baltimore, MD, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>The Johns Hopkins University School Of Medicine, Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected everyone across the globe. The direct effects of infection and subsequent mitigation strategies of social distancing have resulted in severe disruptions in access and delivery of medical care. Esophageal cancer patients may be especially vulnerable to these interruptions in care, given that they are commonly diagnosed in older age, have advanced disease at presentation, and a 5-year survival as low as 19.9% according to National Cancer Institute data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of this pandemic on the delivery of care received by esophageal cancer patients at our institute focusing on their evaluation and management. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective cohort study based on our institution&rsquo;s electronic database. International Classification of Diseases codes were used to identify patients with esophageal cancer. We defined our COVID era as March to December 2020 and compared patients in this cohort with a control &lsquo;pre-COVID era&rsquo; cohort defined as March to December 2019. Patient charts were reviewed to extract sociodemographic and relevant clinical data. We recorded the dates of patient&rsquo;s first visit with a healthcare provider for their gastrointestinal symptoms as well as their date of histopathological diagnosis - which was used to categorize patients into our 2 cohorts, COVID and pre-COVID. Emergent diagnosis was defined as ED visits leading to esophageal cancer diagnosis in the index admission. T-test was used for continuous variables and Chi-square for categorical variables when performing statistical analysis. Approval for study protocol was taken from the Institutional Review Board at The Johns Hopkins Hospital.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 134 patients with esophageal cancer, with 87 from the pre-COVID and 47 from the COVID era. Patients in the COVID cohort had a higher median age (71.5 vs 68.5 years; p= 0.06), an increased proportion of emergent diagnosis (21.9% vs 11.8% p= 0.14), an increased duration between their first provider visit and histopathological diagnosis (median 41 vs 14 days; p= 0.03), and an increased duration from diagnosis to start of treatment (median 40.5 vs 29 days; p= 0.04) than patients in the pre-COVID cohort. In the COVID group, 54.8% of the patients had locally advanced disease compared to 38.9% in the pre-COVID group. Stage 4 disease was present in 40.3% of the patients in the pre-COVID group compared to 28.6% in the COVID group. Only 2 patients (5%) had a positive COVID PCR test in the COVID era.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant delays in accessing care for patients with esophageal cancer. Larger studies and following these patients over time will further clarify the prevalence and impact of such changes. In the meantime, focus on appropriate delivery of care should be increased so that outcomes for our most vulnerable patients can be improved.

Early detection of cancer results in decreased mortality, and in order for a malignancy to be detected and diagnosed, a person must have access to medical care. The population of military individuals, retirees, and their families has free care or care with a minimum out-of-pocket cost provided through TRICARE. This contrasts to the general population, in which insurance coverage is affected by many factors, including employment status, income, and age. This study uses two databases to make comparisons in cancer stage at time of diagnosis between patients with TRICARE, private insurance, Medicaid, and uninsured patients. We hypothesize that comprehensive insurance plans allow for patients to seek care earlier and have earlier detection and diagnosis of malignancy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR) includes cancer patients diagnosed or treated at military treatment facilities, whereas the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program tracks cancer diagnoses in certain areas in the US. For the years 2007-2013, four cancers were selected for the study&mdash;breast, prostate, lung, and colon. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, and diagnosis year. Stratified analysis was performed according to age, gender, race, and year of diagnosis. Adjusted odds ratios compared advanced stage to early stage according to insurance status. Each insurance group in the SEER database was compared to ACTUR as the reference. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 18,440 patients included in ACTUR and 821,177 patients included in SEER. For all cancer types, patients in the SEER-insured/no specifics, Medicaid, and uninsured groups had significantly greater adjusted OR of advanced stage disease compared to ACTUR. The SEER-insured group also had a significantly greater risk of advanced stage disease in cases of prostate cancer and lung cancer. The risk of advanced stage disease was most prominent in lung cancer, with adjusted OR of 1.74 (95% CI 1.61-1.88) in the SEER-insured group compared to ACTUR.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The ACTUR population showed significantly earlier stage of cancer diagnosis compared to the SEER groups for all cancers. Screening rates likely have a contributing role, especially in prostate cancer, however comparisons of screening rates between ACTUR and SEER are limited. The lung cancer data suggests an example where initial presentation driven by symptoms results in earlier stage diagnosis in ACTUR. A limitation of the data is that metrics of socioeconomic status or health behaviors are not included in the databases, however may be associated with both insurance status and cancer risk.

LeCompte<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Liver resection has become a major component of managing metastatic gastrointestinal malignancies. Treatment of metastatic colorectal and neuroendocrine cancer in the liver has been well established, however, the role of hepatic metastasectomy for gynecologic cancers remains controversial. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the second most common gynecologic cancer worldwide and management of advanced stage disease is complex requiring multimodal therapy. In the setting of isolated liver metastasis, the role of resection remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to analyze the use of liver resection in the treatment of metastatic EC. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The American College of Surgeons National Cancer Database was queried to perform a retrospective analysis of adult women with stage IV EC and isolated metastasis to the liver between 2010 and 2016. Patients who had non-epithelial carcinomas, metastasis to other sites, or incomplete surgical data were excluded from the study. Overall survival was estimated with Inverse Probability of Treatment&ndash;Weighted (IPTW) curves. We used IPTW Cox proportional hazard regression to examine the association between liver metastasectomy (LM) and all-cause mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among 801 stage IV EC patients with metastasis to the liver, 141 (18%) underwent LM, 496 (61.9%) received chemotherapy, and 123 (15.3%) had chemotherapy and LM. The majority of patients were white (64.2%), insured with Medicare/Medicaid (58.4%), and treated at an academic/research program (44.8%). Of those who underwent any chemotherapy, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival for chemotherapy+LM versus chemotherapy alone were (65.9 vs. 56.5%), (40.9 vs. 32.9%), and (27.6 vs 22.7%) respectively (Figure 1). In unadjusted analysis, chemotherapy+LM group had reduced mortality risk (HR=0.77, 95% CI=0.61, 0.98; p=.036) with longer median survival time (19.7 vs. 15.2 months) compared to chemotherapy alone group. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, stage, grade, histologic subtype, comorbidity index, and radiotherapy receipt, albeit statistically non-significant, we observed a possible reduction in mortality risk associated with chemotherapy+LM (HR=0.76, 95% CI=0.56, 1.04; p=.083) compared to chemotherapy alone.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study of LM for EC suggests that LM in addition to chemotherapy may be associated with improved survival outcomes for patients with EC. Further prospective study in a larger sample is required to determine which patients benefit most from metastasectomy consideration.

The association between social risk factors and outcomes for patients undergoing high-risk cancer operations, independent of clinical risk, has been well documented. To what extent neighborhood deprivation as an isolated social risk factor is associated with mortality is less known. Using Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a composite measure of housing, education, and employment, we evaluated the association between neighborhood deprivation and mortality, disparities in mortality across deprivation levels and if increased hospital quality was associated with reduction in disparities after complex cancer surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using 100% Medicare fee-for-service claims, we analyzed data on 188,970 Medicare beneficiaries &gt;age 65 undergoing rectal resection, lung resection and pancreaticoduodenectomy for cancer between 2014 and 2018. Clinical risk-adjusted 30-day post-operative mortality rates were used to stratify hospitals into quintiles of quality. Beneficiaries were stratified into quintiles based on census tract ADI. The association of hospital quality and neighborhood deprivation with 30-day mortality was assessed using logistic regression. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
At low-quality hospitals, patients from the most deprived (high ADI) areas had significantly higher risk-adjusted mortality than those from the least deprived (low ADI) areas for all procedures with a mortality disparity detected for pancreaticoduodenectomy (15.9% vs 12.9%; OR=1.26, P&lt;.001), lung resection (8.3% vs 7.8%; OR 1.22, P&lt;0.001), and rectal resection (8.83% vs 8.16%; OR 1.06, P&lt;0.001). Care at a high-quality hospital significantly decreased mortality for patients from high and low ADI areas following pancreaticoduodenectomy (3.1% vs. 2.9%; OR=1.10; P&lt;0.001), lung resection (1.9% vs 1.7% (OR 1.08, P&lt;0.001) and rectal resection (1.4% to 1.5%; OR 0.92, P=0.02). Hospital quality also attenuated disparities across deprivation levels. For example, the absolute difference in mortality for high-ADI vs low-ADI patient undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy was 3.0% at low-quality hospitals but decreased to 0.2% at high-quality hospitals (Table 1). For lung resection, the absolute mortality difference was reduced from 0.5% at low-quality hospitals to 0.2% at high-quality hospitals. For rectal resection, it was reduced from 0.6% to 0.1%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Receipt of surgery at a high-quality hospital was associated with reduced 30-day risk-adjusted mortality disparities based on neighborhood deprivation for 3 complex cancer procedures. Initiatives to increase access to high quality hospitals for patients from high deprivation levels may improve outcomes and contribute to mitigating disparities.

Gastric adenocarcinoma (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality across the globe. Hispanic/Latinx (Hs/L), the second fastest growing minority in the US, have a significantly higher incidence of GC and worse outcomes than non-Hs/L counterparts. Texas has the second largest number of Hs/L in the US. Social determinants in health care continue to influence outcomes in both timely diagnosis and treatment strategies. Hs/L patients are known to have less access to conventional health care and often present with advanced disease, especially young males.The purpose of this study was to identify Texas-specific clinical and social features associated with in GC among Hs/L and non-Hs/L.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Patients with diagnosis of GC were identified from the Texas Cancer Registry from 1995 to 2018. Patients were classified as Hs/L versus non-Hs/L. The following parameters were included in the analysis: sex, age, insurance status, poverty index, place of birth, place of residence, stage, tumor grade, histologic subtype, treatment, smoking status, and weight.

Fisher&rsquo;s Exact test was used to determine significance of associations between Hs/L status and categorical variables, a Student&rsquo;s t-test was used to assess mean differences between Hs/L status and continuous variables. Survival distributions were summarized with Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves; median survival and 5-year survival in different groups were of interest. A propensity-weighted Cox regression model was used to perform a multivariate analysis after covariate balancing.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

We identified 8,888 Hispanic and 17,241 non-Hispanic patients with GC. Based on univariate analysis, Hs/L patients lived more in impoverished neighborhoods (58.5% vs 27.5%; p&lt;0.001), were less male (58.9% vs 65.2%; p&lt;0.001), presented at a younger age (63.76&plusmn;15.11 vs 67.55&plusmn;13.64; p&lt;0.001) and more frequently with distant metastases (28.6% vs 25.2%;p&lt;0.001). Histologic subtype and insurance status did not vary significantly with ethnicity. Hs/L status was associated with higher propensity to be alive (15.9% vs 12.5%; p&lt;0.001) but KM curves suggested no significant variation with ethnicity (logrank p=0.72).

After multivariate propensity weighted Cox regression analysis Hs/L status was not significantly associated with survival; age and stage contributed significantly to the model. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Hs/L patients with gastric cancer appear to present at a more advanced stage and a younger age. However in Texas, Hs/L background alone does not appear to influence survival. In our study, social determinants of health, such as poverty index and insurance status did not influence the outcomes of our patients. Difference in GC presentation in Texas may be due to complex interaction between the social determinants and inherent biology. Further molecular and epidemiological evaluation of GC between Hs/L and non-Hs/L in Texas may shed light onto the causes of racial/ethnic disparities in the country.

Interventions include watchful waiting, self-management education, and periodic rescreening with mild symptoms (PHQ-9 score: 5-9), as well as pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, creation of a treatment and follow-up plan, education, and reevaluation for patients with major depression (PHQ-9 score: &ge;10). This is a review of a single-institution, prospectively collected database of geriatric-oncology patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Over a 6-year period (11.2012 - 12.2018), 321 patients enrolled in the geriatric oncology program (median age: 76 years, 53% female). A broad database of clinical information was collected prospectively, including demographics, comorbidity, longitudinal PHQ-9 scores at 30, 60, and 180-day visits, and social services referral status. PHQ-9 scores &ge; 5 triggered social service referrals, to facilitate care with mental health services. Through the database, we reviewed compliance with this care. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Seventy-six patients had PHQ-9 scores and social services referral data available from their 180-day visit. Of these 22 patients (29%) had PHQ-9 scores &ge; 5, however only 9 (12%) of these patients received social services referrals, for a compliance rate of 9/22 (41%). Four patients (5%) had PHQ-9 scores &ge;10, of these 2 patients (2.6%) were successfully referred to social services, for a compliance rate of 2/4 (50%) in this subset. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite a proactive geriatric oncology program with patient navigation services, compliance rate was suboptimal with respect to the management of depression. This was particularly concerning in the subset of patients with more severe symptoms (major depression). Due to limited access to mental health services, other interventions may be needed such as a per-diem behavioral oncologist.

We examined how rates of overall survival (OS) and cancer specific survival (CSS) have changed over time based on race and ethnicity in a large contemporary dataset of patients with MBC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients with de novo MBC from 1988-2016 were selected from SEER. Differences were examined by race/ethnicity, defined as non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB), non-Hispanic other (NHO), or Hispanic (HIS). OS and CSS rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method by year of diagnosis to visualize change in survival over time. Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to determine which factors were associated with survival, after adjustment.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 47,034 patients were included. Median follow-up was 91 months (95% CI 89-93), although the majority of patients were diagnosed in 2010-2016 (41.3%, vs 31% 2003-2009, 17.5% 1996-2002, and 10.2% 1988-1995). The majority of patients were NHW (67.2% vs 16.2% NHB, 9.5% HIS, 7.1% NHO). Among HIS patients, 12.7% were &lt;40 years old (vs 4.6% NHW, 9.7% NHB, 9.6% NHO, p&lt;0.001). Among NHW patients, 33.1% were &gt;70 years old (vs 20.6% NHB, 18.8% HIS, 18.8% NHO, p&lt;0.001). Tumor biomarkers varied by race/ethnicity - triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) rates: 11.5% NHW, 19.3% NHB, 12.7% HIS, 10% NHO; and HER2+ rates: 22.1% NHW, 23.9% NHB, 27.4% HIS, 28.3% NHO (p&lt;0.001). Most patients had 1 site of metastatic disease (69.7% NHW, 66.5% NHB, 68.7% HIS, 66.9% NHO, p=0.03).

Over time, survival improved for all race/ethnicity groups: diagnosis year 2000 &gt; 2015, 1-year CSS rates for NHW 64.2% &gt; 75.4%, for NHB 57.6% &gt; 67.8%, for NHO 63.0% &gt; 75.1%, and for HIS 63.6% &gt; 76.0%, although disparities persisted (Figure). In general, NHB patients had the worst survival outcomes (unadjusted median OS 21mo and CSS 24mo), while NHO patients had the best outcomes (34 and 39mo; vs 30 and 33mo for NHW, and 33 and 35mo for HIS). These differences varied over time when stratified by tumor phenotype. After adjustment for select patient and disease factors, only NHB patients still had significantly different (worse) outcomes compared to NHW (OS: HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.20-1.34; CSS: HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.32; both p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Racial and ethnic disparities in breast cancer outcomes exist in an MBC-only cohort of patients, with notably worse outcomes for NHB patients. Disparities in outcomes across these groups persist, regardless of burden of disease at diagnosis or tumor phenotype. Inequities must be addressed in order to more adequately and equitably treat breast cancer across all racial and ethnic groups.

The incidence of completion lymph node dissection has decreased after results from the MSLT II trial. There is still a role for salvage lymphadenectomies for immunotherapy/ targeted therapy resistant regional disease and these are associated with a high infectious complication rate and lymphedema. There are conflicting data on the efficacy of preoperative immunonutrition supplementation in reducing infectious complication rates. The aim of this study is to assess the tolerability and efficacy of preoperative immunonutrition in reducing infectious complications after inguinal and axillary lymphadenectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Fifty-two patients who underwent inguinal/axillary lymphadenectomy for melanoma, between 2015-2020, received 5 days of immunonutritional supplement (3 cans of Impact AR&reg;, Nestle&reg; containing arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, nucleotides) preoperatively and perioperative outcomes were compared with thirty-nine patients from 2011-2017 who did not receive nutritional supplementation from a prospective melanoma database. Patients underwent nutritional assessment using the MUST (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool) score and malnourished patients (score &gt;1) were excluded from this study. High-grade infectious complications were defined as infections requiring intervention or hospitalization (CTCAE V4.03, Grade 3 or higher).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Immunonutrition group and control group had similar comorbidities, primary site (P = 0.652) and lymphadenectomy site (P = 0.651). Although the immunonutrition group had a higher number of salvage lymphadenectomies (P = 0.044), they also had a lower total number of patients with infectious complications (P = 0.042) and fewer high-grade infections (P = 0.033). The overall complication rates were similar (P = 0.202) and the median lymph node yields were similar between both groups for axillary and inguinal lymphadenectomy. Overall compliance was good with 43 (82.7%) patients completing the 5 day course. Reasons for poor compliance were dislike of the supplement &ldquo;fishy&rdquo; flavor in 6 and satiety in 4. No significant difference was noted between the two groups with respect to postoperative seroma rate, prolonged drainage, length of hospital stay, readmission and lymphedema rates.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Preoperative immunonutrition with Impact AR&reg; was well tolerated and in well-nourished patients demonstrated a significant decrease in infectious complications.

Many have unmet physical, developmental, and mental health needs. While the AAP Committee on Adolescence publishes a policy statement every 10 years on the important role of pediatricians in providing transition of care, the surgical needs of this population are not well understood.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An IRB-approved, retrospective review was performed of the security intake data for all patients who were under custody and transported for subspecialty care to a stand-alone children&rsquo;s hospital.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Between January 1, 2020 and March 30, 2021, 74 patients were transported to Children&rsquo;s Hospital for 199 subspecialty evaluations. Most were male (93%) and most identified as Black (89%). The median age was 16 years (range 13-20). Fourteen (18.9%) had a chronic medical condition and 32 (43%) had a behavioral health history. 54 (73%) patients had a previous arrest. 63 (85%) experienced previous trauma (68.9% blunt, 12.2% penetrating, 6.8% both), and 40 (54%) had documented head trauma. Documented dental care (1.4%) was infrequent. Substance abuse (32.4%) or history of self harm (23%) were commonly identified, and 19% reported being sexually active. Of the female patients, 50% had history of sexual trauma. At our hospital most encounters (64.8%) were for trauma-related issues, of which 25 (33.8%) were for trauma related to the arrest. Of the 54 patients who had a previous arrest 91% had history of physical trauma, whereas those who did not have a history of previous arrest the incidence of previous trauma was lower (70%)(p=0.026). Overall, 30 patients were admitted for medical and surgical indications, with 2 requiring admission to the intensive care unit. The outpatient subspecialties visited most frequently were orthopedics (62), psychiatry (13), face/ENT/plastic surgery (13), oncology (7), and concussion clinic (5).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Most of the subspecialty encounters in this population are for trauma-related issues, revealing an opportunity to develop trauma-centered care in this vulnerable population. Standardizing interviews for intake medical clearance could provide an opportunity to identify gaps in care for these patients who may not otherwise have access to preventative services such as vaccinations, sexual health and substance abuse counseling, dental care, or mental health services.

Children of racial and ethnic minorities have higher rates of perforated appendicitis due to complex social and economic inequalities; however, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on these disparities is unknown. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with acute appendicitis in U.S. Children&rsquo;s Hospitals.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Using the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database, we performed a retrospective cohort study of children who underwent appendectomy or drainage procedure for acute appendicitis between January 1st, 2019 &ndash; December 31st, 2020 in 49 U.S. Children&rsquo;s Hospitals. Patients treated after March 1st, 2020, were considered treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Race and ethnicity were categorized into non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB), Hispanic/Latino (HL), and other. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis. The secondary outcome was laparoscopic appendectomy. We performed chi-squared tests to compare the proportions of perforated appendicitis before and during the pandemic. We developed difference-in-difference logistic regression models to examine the interaction of race and ethnicity with treatment during the pandemic on the primary outcome after adjustment for salient patient characteristics.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 32,391 children were included: 13,725 NHW (42.4%), 2,228 NHB (6.9%), 12,603 HL (38.9%), and 3,835 other (11.8%). Perforated appendicitis was found in 14,483 (44.7%). Overall we observed a significant increase in perforated appendicitis during the pandemic (Absolute Difference (95%CI): 2.5% (0.8%-7.3%), p=0.01) (Table 1). These differences were driven by significant increases in HL children (Absolute Difference (95%CI) 3.9% (2.0%-6.0%, p&lt;0.001) and other race/ethnicity children (Absolute Difference (95%CI): 4.1% (1.0%-7.0%, p=0.01). In our logistic regression model, we observed a significant interaction in the odds of presenting with perforated appendicitis during the pandemic in HL children (difference in difference OR (95% CI): 1.12 (1.01-1.24), p=0.02). NHB children were less likely to undergo laparoscopic appendectomy when compared to NHW peers (adjusted OR (95%CI): 0.57 (0.47-0.69), p&lt;0.001). In contrast, HL children were more likely to undergo laparoscopic appendectomy (adjusted OR (95%CI): 1.32 (1.16-1.51), p&lt;0.001). These odds of laparoscopic appendectomy did not change during the pandemic.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Children of racial and ethnic minorities have higher rates of perforated appendicitis when compared to their white peers, and during the COVID-19 pandemic this disparity intensified for HL patients. Further research is needed to understand the mechanism for these worsening disparities.

DeBakey Department Of Surgery, Houston, TX, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Texas Children's Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
COVID-19 spurred an unprecedented transition in the medical community for outpatient consultations from in-person office visits to virtual telemedicine evaluations. Despite the rapid shift to virtual visits, concerns of healthcare disparities have been raised in other pediatric and adult populations, particularly in low-income individuals and families who have limited access to the resources necessary for this medium of medical care. However, the effect of a transition to telemedicine has yet to be described among patients undergoing evaluation for prenatal care for fetal anomalies. This study aims to describe the patient demographics and care of pregnant women with prenatally diagnosed surgical fetal anomalies following a shift to telemedicine.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Electronic health record data of patients (mother and baby) evaluated by the fetal surgery team at a large tertiary pediatric referral center with initial visits between March 2019 and May 2021 (with the shift to telemedicine occurring in March 2020) were used to conduct analysis of patient demographics and if patients continued to deliver in our institution. Univariate analysis was performed between the study groups with two sample t-test or chi squared and a p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Over the study period, 292 pregnancies were identified as being evaluated by the fetal surgery team. Following the initial transition to telemedicine, two patients were evaluated in the traditional office setting with the remaining 167 having telemedicine encounters (Table 1). There was no difference in median maternal (30 vs 30 years) or gestational age (25.9 vs 26.1 weeks, p=0.4) between pre- and post-telemedicine transition, respectively. There was no difference in self-reported race (p=0.28), ethnicity (p=0.46), or preferred primary language (p=0.98). There was a small but insignificant increase in the percentage of patients with public health insurances (40% vs 34%, p=0.17), with no difference in marital or employment status between the two groups (p=0.20 and p=0.35, respectively). The proportion of patients who continued care to birth at our institution was unchanged with the advent of telemedicine (71% vs 70%, p=0.44), and there was no change in the number of patients presented from out of state (25%) and out of city (75%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
There was no difference in patient demographics or the number of patients who continued care to completion at our fetal center in the year leading up to, and the time following, the transition to telemedicine. These findings lend evidence of our successful integration of telemedicine in prenatal evaluation and management of surgical fetal anomalies with maintained access to care throughout the pandemic.

Lower socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked to increased rates of complicated appendicitis. This study uses multivariate modeling to analyze the complex interactions between social determinants of health and postoperative outcomes in pediatric appendicitis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
After institutional review board approval, we retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients (age 0-18y) who underwent appendectomy at our institution (2015&mdash;2020). Demographic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status) were abstracted from NSQIP-P. Home addresses were used to determine composite measures of neighborhood/area-level SES [Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and Social Deprivation Index (SDI)] and other area-level SES indicators. We created a novel composite outcome score; a weighted average of 8 outcome indicators (length of stay, percutaneous drain placement, PICC placement, ED visit within 30 days of discharge, and postoperative fever, antibiotics, imaging, and parenteral nutrition). Demographic, social characteristics, and composite outcomes for simple (SA) and complicated appendicitis (CA) were compared using chi-square analysis. Feature selection and exploratory factor analysis were used to create a multivariate model predictive of composite outcome score. Principal component analysis was used to investigate consistency of the resulting model.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 1117 children with appendicitis, 20.7% had CA. Compared to SA, children with CA were younger [median (IQR) age (y) 9.5(4.8) vs 12.0(5.7), p&lt;0.01] and less likely to be Hispanic (5.2% vs. 10.0%, p = 0.02). Children with CA had higher composite outcome scores compared to SA (27(17) vs. 3(7), p&lt;0.01). Factor analysis identified 2 uncorrelated multivariate latent factors; Factor 1 contained SDI, ADI, and % unemployed in the population (based on census data) and Factor 2 contained % Hispanic and % foreign-born in the population. Two similar principal components were identified accounting for 79.0% of data variance (Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While previous studies have investigated the impact of social determinants of health on CA, ours is the first to use a multivariable approach to analyze interactions between individual indicators of SES and outcomes in CA. Multivariate modeling allows exploration for associations among covariates that add insight over univariate analysis by reducing a large number of variables into underlying latent factors. Intuitively, the factors may reflect overall SES (Factor 1) and cultural elements (Factor 2) that may manifest as different patterns of health care utilization in communities with high percentages of Hispanic and foreign-born residents. Our model suggests that SES and elements of ethnicity are predictive of postoperative outcomes in CA.

Studies often evaluate social determinants of health through data available in the medical record or administrative databases, including race, gender, and insurance status. However, limited data exists to evaluate poverty and health access-related influences at a structural population level. This study evaluates the role of structural factors related to poverty, food access, and public benefit utilization at the census tract level, specifically evaluating food deserts and social vulnerability in pediatric scald burns.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A single-institution retrospective review was conducted of pediatric burns (&lt;16 years old) identified in the trauma registry between January 2016 and December 2020. First degree burns were excluded. Patient demographics, burn injury mechanism, burn characteristics, operative details, outcomes, complications and outpatient follow-up were abstracted from the trauma registry and electronic medical record. Patient address was used to obtain geocodes at the census tract level using publicly-available resources through the US Census Bureau. Socioeconomic metrics of the home environment, including poverty rate, food access, urban/rural designation, public benefits received, and low-income or low-access tract were estimated at the census tract level from the Food Access Research Atlas and the social vulnerability index (relative vulnerability of a US census tract to a hazardous event as defined by the CDC). Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographic patterns and outcomes were evaluated using univariate analysis comparing scald to non-scald.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 840 patients met inclusion criteria (49.8% scald, N=418, 50.2% no scald, N=422). Mean TBSA for scald was 6.6% with an age of 10.2 years. 76% (n=317) of scald had Medicaid and 15% (n=63) were due to hot noodles with the remainder due to hot liquid. Scald occurred more in females (45.7%, N=191 vs 28.0%, N=118; p&lt;0.0001), non-white race (62.7%, N=262 vs 29.1%, N=123; p&lt;0.0001) and low-income and low-food access populations (39.8 %, N=147 vs 30.4%, N=116; p=0.007). Low-access black populations showed increased scald injury (18% [IQR 6-35] vs 10% [IQR 4-25]) while all other populations showed no association. Patients with scald had a higher overall social vulnerability index (0.67 vs 0.62, p=0.008) with the category of minority status and language having the highest significance (0.42 vs 0.32, p&lt;0.0001). Report of physical abuse was higher in patients with scald than no scald (10.8%, N=45 vs 6.6%, N=28; p=0.037).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Often related to poverty, health access and health equity, population-level social determinants of health like food access and social vulnerability have significant impact on patient outcomes and should influence health outreach, systems improvement, and prevention measures.

Perrone<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan, Pediatric Surgery, Ann Arbor, MI, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Michigan, School Of Public Health, Department Of Health Behavior And Health Education, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our academic pediatric surgical practice implemented a pilot telemedicine program to limit face-to-face contact. We offered preoperative video visits (VVs) without an in-person visit prior to elective surgery. In this study, we outline the demographic and clinical details of the patients who underwent the preoperative VV, and we analyze feedback from the participating caregivers and providers. Our aims were to determine whether VVs provided preoperative care that was convenient and satisfactory, and to evaluate feasibility for continuation of VVs beyond the pandemic.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All patients who had only a preoperative VV prior to an elective surgery were identified from March&ndash;October 2020. Retrospective chart reviews gathered clinical and demographic details. After their experience, caregivers were surveyed via telephone. Surgeons and clinic staff (&ldquo;providers&rdquo;) were emailed a survey regarding their perceptions.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Thirty-four patients successfully participated in a preoperative VV followed by an elective operation. The majority were hernia repairs (41%; n=14), followed by feeding tube placement (18%; n=6) and skin or soft tissue procedures (15%; n=5). Of the 31 caregiver surveys completed, the majority agreed or strongly agreed that they missed less work (80%; n=24 out of the 30 total answers) and spent less money (81%; n=25) than if the preoperative appointment had been conducted in person. The majority (94%; n=29) agreed or strongly agreed that they would choose to participate in a VV again if offered, and 87% (n=27) strongly agreed that the VV was more convenient than in an-person visit. Caregivers saved an average travel distance of 60.3 miles one way (range 6.1&ndash;480) with the VV option. Twenty-nine of the caregivers (94%) agreed or strongly agreed that they were overall satisfied with their child&rsquo;s care. Of the 13/17 providers who responded to the survey, 69% (n=9) felt that VV provided better satisfaction to families, and 77% (n=10) expressed that the practice should continue.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Virtual health became a necessity during the pandemic and caregivers were overwhelmingly satisfied. Continuing VVs as an option beyond the pandemic may be a reasonable and effective way to help eliminate some of the hurdles that impede healthcare-seeking behavior. Preoperative video visits can provide adequate care to the pediatric surgical patient in a way that saves travel time, money, and that is satisfactory to both the caregiver and the provider.

LEP in patient populations have been linked to lower healthcare access and worse clinical outcomes. Even though medical institutions have been able to lessen the impact of language discordant care with the use of interpreters, underutilization and interpretation errors of clinical importance remain a concern. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of LEP in the clinical outcomes of pediatric burn patient.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a single-institution retrospective chart review of burn patients &lt;16 years old presenting at a tertiary pediatric burn referral program between January 2016 and December 2020. Patients were identified from the institutional trauma registry. Additional patient demographics, burn mechanism, burn severity, burn interventions, and primary patient language were abstracted from the electronic health record. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was conducted. We analyzed LEP patients&rsquo; clinical outcomes (length of stay, clinic follow-up, and 30-day readmission) while controlling for age, burn severity, concomitant trauma, and complications compared to the primary English-speaking patients (ESP). Subanalysis was done in patients with &gt;10% TBSA burns to evaluate patients who may have increased health education and outpatient care needs.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 840 patients met criteria with 4.2% (n=35) LEP and 95.8% (n=805) ESP. On univariate analysis, there was no difference in mean TBSA (6.5% vs 6.1%), report of physical abuse (2.9% vs 8.9%), or need for grafting (14.3% vs 15.0%) comparing LEP to ESP. Patients with LEP were more likely to have a scald burn (68.6% vs 48.9%, p=0.025) and less likely to have a flame/fire burn (20.0% vs 37.6%, p=0.047). When controlling a priori for age, concomitant trauma or inhalational injury, TBSA, burn degree and need for grafting, there was no difference between patients with LEP compared to English as a primary language for length of stay (LOS (2.9 vs 3.5 days), 30-day readmissions (5.6% vs 5.7%), or clinic follow-up (80.6% vs 75.0%). In patients with &gt;10% TBSA, LEP patients had a longer emergency department length of stay (277 minutes vs 145 minutes, p=0.06) but no difference in outcome measures.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Primary patient language with limited English proficiency as identified in the electronic health record was not found to impact pediatric burn outcomes at our institution. Further research is needed to better explore the role of primary language and health communication as a social determinant of health in pediatric burn patients.

The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with safe opioid disposal in adolescents undergoing surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adolescents (13-20y) and their parents were recruited from a tertiary children&rsquo;s hospital in an urban, metropolitan area prior to undergoing a surgery associated with an opioid prescription at discharge. Parents completed 3 surveys: a baseline survey measuring race/ethnicity, income, education level, primary language, substance abuse history, opioid abuse risk, and health literacy before surgery, and 2 postoperative surveys capturing prescription opioid use and disposal at 30 and 90 days. Safe disposal was defined as returning unused pills to a healthcare facility, pharmacy, takeback event, or police station. Not disposing of pills or disposing in an alternate manner was classified as unsafe. Among parents reporting unused prescription opioids after surgery, factors associated with safe opioid disposal were assessed using bivariate analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 119 parent-adolescent pairs were recruited with 90 (75%) parents reporting unused prescription opioids after surgery. Enrolled adolescents underwent the following procedures: posterior spinal fusion (53%), arthroscopy (23%), pectus excavatum repair (9%), tonsillectomy (7%), hip reconstruction (7%), and pectus carinatum repair (1%). Most parents completed the surveys in English (96%) but many spoke a language other than English at home (44%). Most parents reported income levels &lt;$60,000 (54%), did not attend college (69%), and had adequate health literacy (66%). Family history of using illegal drugs was uncommon (9%), and few parents screened positive for personal risk of prescription opioid abuse (2%). Of those with unused prescription opioids after surgery, few (22%) reported safe opioid disposal. Parents of younger adolescents more commonly reported safe opioid disposal (14.6y+1.7 vs. 15.6y+1.8, p=0.03). Parents reporting more leftover opioid pills at 30 days (34.4&plusmn;38.5 vs. 14.2&plusmn;12.8, p&lt;0.01) and fewer total days taking opioid pills at 90 days (5.4&plusmn;4.4 vs. 9.8&plusmn;9.5, p&lt;0.05) more often safely disposed of unused opioids . 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In the months after surgery, adolescents commonly have unused prescription opioids in the home with few parents reporting safe opioid disposal. Younger patient age, shorter duration of opioid use, and higher number of unused pills contribute to likelihood of safe opioid disposal. Future interventions to optimize opioid prescribing practices, target parental perceptions of opioid-associated risks, and educate parents about safe opioid disposal are needed.

Islam<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Florida, College Of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Florida, Division Of Pediatric Surgery, Department Of Surgery, Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Severe bowel and bladder control issues are noted in infants and children and encompass a spectrum of lower urinary symptoms, encopresis/incontinence, and constipation which may be recalcitrant to current therapies. Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a form of neuromodulation shown to be very effective in adults with fecal or urinary incontinence. It is hypothesized that SNS may also be a safe and effective treatment in the pediatric population, and we present our experience with this therapy.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

After IRB approval, we reviewed all cases of patients aged 0-22 years who received SNS at our institution from January 1, 2015 to May 1, 2021. Variables for demographics, baseline characteristics, and clinical outcomes were collected using REDCap through chart review and telephone interviews with the patient and/or caretaker(s). Basic statistical analysis was accomplished through REDCap and two-tailed paired sample t-tests were performed (alpha = 0.05).

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 10 patients were identified meeting inclusion criteria (5 female and 5 male). The mean age at symptom onset was 1.3 years of age, with most patients having symptoms starting in the neonatal period. The mean age at implantation was 11.2 years. All of the patients in the study identified as white and non-Hispanic or Latino. 8 patients had fecal incontinence, 6 had urinary incontinence, 6 had constipation, and 5 had anorectal malformation as their primary indication(s) for SNS implantation. The mean encopresis episodes per week pre- and post-implantation were 21.89 and 2.44, respectively (p = 0.103). The mean spontaneous bowel movements per week pre- and post-implantation were 0.80 and 8.95 (p = 0.007). One patient was excluded from analysis as they described &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; encopresis episodes pre-implantation which did not change after stage I implantation. There was a single pocket infection post-operatively which required removal of the stimulator and leads with successful re-implantation three months later. Overall, 3 patients required revision surgeries, 1 patient had the device removed after stage I implantation, and 1 patient had the device removed after stage II implantation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

SNS appears to be a safe and effective treatment for children with bowel and bladder dysfunction, particularly in increasing the number of spontaneous bowel movements as well as potentially reducing encopresis. This study is limited by the relatively small sample size as well as recall bias from patients and caretakers. Larger, multicenter studies with a more diverse population would help to further investigate the effect of SNS, which seems to be a promising alternative for children with incontinence.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an increasingly prevalent disease affecting children that is generally treated with dietary and medical management, but may benefit from a gastrostomy tube (g-tube) for nutritional support. However, no studies have investigated the effects of g-tubes on symptomatic and/or pathologic improvement of EoE. We aimed to characterize the population of EoE patients that require g-tubes and examine their effect on symptomatic and pathologic improvement.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We conducted a descriptive retrospective cohort study of patients with EoE from 5/2015 to 5/2020, to evaluate pathologic, symptomatic, and dietary improvement after having a g-tube placed. We identified the treatment prevalence, indications for placement, comorbidities amongst patients, and indirect effect on symptoms and pathology. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

14 patients met inclusion criteria. The main indication for g-tube was FTT or malnutrition (92.9%). The most common comorbidity was motor-neurologic disease (71.4% of patients) while 13 patients (92.9%) had a food or drug allergy. Of all the participants, half of the patients had symptomatic improvement, 5 (35.7%) had improved oral intake, and 4 (28.6%) had both of these positive outcomes. 6 (42.9%) patients had pathologic improvement, of which half occurred before g-tube placement. Only 3 (21.4%) patients had the g-tube removed. Of the 5 patients who had a diagnosis of EoE prior to the g-tube placement, 4 (80%) had dietary improvement and 1 (20%) went on to have their g-tube removed. Of the 9 patients who were diagnosed with EoE at or after g-tube placement, 3 (33%) had symptomatic improvement, 3 (33%) had pathologic improvement, and 2 (22%) had their g-tube removed.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

G-tube placement is most commonly required in patients with FTT in need of nutritional support. In our analysis, we determined that placement inconsistently correlates with symptomatic and pathologic improvement for EoE. Overall, we suggest early intervention by a multidisciplinary team including pediatric gastroenterology, speech-language pathology, and dietary/nutrition to help patients achieve adequate nutritional needs. Larger studies are needed to better evaluate the use of g-tubes in the management of EoE.

Due to risk of respiratory depression and death, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black-box warning in April 2017 contraindicating tramadol in children age &lt;12 years. The trends and factors associated with continued tramadol use in children undergoing surgery remain unclear.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective, multi-institutional cohort study of 49 children&rsquo;s hospitals utilizing the Pediatric Health Information System database was performed. Children ages 2-18 years who underwent 10 common surgeries (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, central venous catheterization, bowel resection, bladder/ureteral reconstruction, ovarian cystectomy/oophorectomy/salpingectomy, burn debridement/grafting, gastrostomy tube placement, anti-reflux surgery, talc pleurodesis or decortication) from 2009-2019 were included and stratified by age (&lt;12 years, &ge;12 years). Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis including patient and hospital characteristics was performed to identify factors associated with tramadol use.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 471,896 children identified, 276,581 (58.6%) were age &lt;12 years and 5,813 (1.2%) received perioperative tramadol. Overall, 898/5,813 (15.5%) children received tramadol after the black-box warning, 368 of which were age &lt;12 years. In children age &lt;12 years, annual tramadol use peaked at 1.9% in 2016 and decreased to 0.66% in 2019 (Figure). Regression analysis demonstrated that female sex, age &ge;12 years, and Midwest location significantly increased the likelihood of receiving tramadol. Conversely, children of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and those with public insurance had decreased likelihood of receiving tramadol. Tramadol use also significantly varied by surgery type and patient comorbidities. Tramadol was more likely to be used after cholecystectomy (OR 1.18; 95% CI 1.05, 1.33) and in children with gastrointestinal (OR 2.38, 95% CI: 2.19, 2.60), metabolic (OR 1.40; 95% CI: 1.27, 1.55) or transplant-related (OR 1.81; 95% CI: 1.57, 2.09) chronic medical comorbidities. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, children age &lt;12 years hospitalized following the black-box warning were less likely to receive tramadol compared to those seen before the warning (adjusted OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.71).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While the FDA contraindication coincided with a decrease in tramadol prescriptions, tramadol continues to be given to children age &lt;12 years perioperatively. Tramadol use varies significantly by patient demographics, comorbidities, and surgical practice. These results highlight the need for continued education to reduce tramadol use in children undergoing surgery.

Thorson<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Miami, Surgery, Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Gastrostomy tube (GT) placement for enteral access is one of the most frequently performed procedures by pediatric surgeons for infants with numerous congenital conditions. There are discrepancies in the current literature regarding outcomes of infants with congenital cardiac anomalies (CCAs) undergoing GT placement. This study sought to characterize differences in procedural characteristics for GT placement in infants with CCAs and their effects on postoperative and readmission complications. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Nationwide Readmission Database was queried from 2010 to 2014 for newborns who underwent gastrostomy tube (GT) placement during their index hospitalization. Patients were stratified into those with or without CCAs other than an isolated patent ductus arteriosus, atrial or ventricular septal defect, and compared using standard statistical tests. Results were weighted for national estimates.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 5,997 patients identified who underwent GT placement. Patients with CCAs more frequently underwent open GT (59% vs. 55%) and less frequently underwent laparoscopic (17% vs. 19%) or percutaneous (24% vs. 26%) GT placement (p=0.043). Concomitant Ladd&rsquo;s procedure for intestinal malrotation was more often performed in those with CCAs (10% vs. 4%, p&lt;0.001). Overall index admission GT complications were similar between groups, including infection and overall GT complication (Table 1). Postoperative gastrointestinal disorders were more common in those without CCAs (Table 1). Evaluating only those undergoing laparoscopic GT, there were similar rates of GT complications (7% vs. 11%, p=0.073) and less readmission complications (0% vs. 5%, p&lt;0.001) in those with CCAs compared to those without CCAs.

Patients with CCAs had higher overall readmission rates (39% vs 31%) and higher 30-day ($18,581 vs. $11,542) and overall median readmission costs ($35,787 vs. $20,073; all p&lt;0.001). GT complications on readmission (5% vs. 3%), including GT infection (2% vs. 0.3%), were more common in those with CCAs compared to those without (both p&lt;0.001).



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: During the newborn period, outcomes of gastrostomy tube placement are largely similar between patients with and without congenital cardiac anomalies. However, those with cardiac anomalies may experience more long-term complications based on readmission data. This knowledge may be used to develop interventions to improve healthcare delivery for this vulnerable patient population after GT placement.

Children undergoing gastrostomy placement often have complex medical conditions that can increase the burden on families caring for them and worsen caregiver health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Increased caregiver burden can subsequently lead to worse outcomes after surgery. Our goal was to identify changes in HRQoL over a 12-month period in caregivers of pediatric patients undergoing gastrostomy placement.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We performed a prospective case-control study of pediatric patients undergoing gastrostomy placement. Using the PedsQL 2.0 Family Impact Module, we surveyed caregivers of patients undergoing gastrostomy placement at baseline (prior to gastrostomy placement) and 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months following gastrostomy placement. We administered the same survey at baseline to a control group composed of caregivers of pediatric patients undergoing elective hernia repair. We then performed univariate analysis using non-parametric tests to assess changes in HRQoL in caregivers of gastrostomy patients compared to baseline controls. To evaluate changes in HRQoL over time, we used generalized linear models with random effects.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

We enrolled 131 patients undergoing gastrostomy placement and 35 patients undergoing hernia repair. Twenty-five (19%) caregivers of patients undergoing gastrostomy placement completed both baseline and 12-month follow-up surveys. At baseline, these caregivers had significantly lower total HRQoL compared to caregivers of children undergoing hernia repair (47.4&plusmn;16.1 vs. 86.0&plusmn;15.6, p&lt;0.001). The largest differences in baseline HRQoL between these cases and controls were in the daily activities (81.9&plusmn;27.6 vs. 20.3&plusmn;20.4, p&lt;0.001) and worry (86.3&plusmn;14.0 vs. 33.0&plusmn;22.8, p&lt;0.001) subdomains. In the first year after gastrostomy placement, caregivers had significant increases in total HRQoL (p&lt;0.01) and the physical functioning (p&lt;0.05), communication (p&lt;0.05), worry (p&lt;0.05), and daily activities (p&lt;0.001) subdomains. In caregivers of gastrostomy patients who had both baseline and 12-month follow-up data, we observed a significant increase in the total HRQoL score at 12 months compared to baseline (60.7&plusmn;18.9 vs. 47.4&plusmn;16.1, p&lt;0.01). Their total HRQoL at 12 months, however, remained significantly lower compared to controls (60.7&plusmn;18.9 vs. 86.0&plusmn;15.6, p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

We observed a significantly lower HRQoL in caregivers of children undergoing gastrostomy placement compared to controls. While we identified significant improvements in caregiver HRQoL over time, caregivers of patients 12 months post gastrostomy placement continued to have lower HRQoL relative to the control group. These findings highlight the ongoing caregiver burden associated with children undergoing gastrostomy placement and provide evidence of the need for quality improvement efforts directed at caregiver support post gastrostomy placement.

Firearm injuries (GSW) in the pediatric population are a public health crisis. Little is known about the outcomes of damage control laparotomy (DCL) following abdominal GSW. This study aims to evaluate outcomes from abdominal GSWs in the pediatric population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The trauma registry from an urban Level 1 trauma was queried for pediatric (0-18 yrs) GSW was queried from September 2013 to June 2020. Demographics, clinical variables, outcomes, readmissions, and recidivism were analyzed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Abdominal GSW was identified in 83 patients (17% of all GSW). The median age was 16 [15-17], 84% were male and 86% black. Violent intent accounted for 90% of GSW. The injury severity score was 16 [9-26] and 80% went directly from the resuscitation bay to the operating room. The most common abdominal organ injured were liver (33%), colon (30%), small intestine (28%), stomach (19%), and diaphragm (19%). In those that had an injury to multiple body areas, the most common were chest (32%), upper extremity (23%), lower extremity (21%), and neck (11%).

 

Laparotomy was required in 87% of patients, 6 (8%) of which no injury was found. Surgery was not required in any patient initially managed non-operatively. Intraabdominal Infection was the most common complication (20%), followed by other infections (13%), and small bowel obstruction (8%). DCL with temporary abdominal closure was performed in 16% of laparotomies and was associated with a longer length of stay, more infections, but similar rates of readmission and mortality (Table 1). Overall mortality was 13%, with all but 1 patient expiring in the resuscitation bay or the operating room, and only 1 mortality had an isolated abdominal wound. All patients who underwent DCL survived to discharge.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Abdominal firearm Injuries have high morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. Damage control operations for abdominal GSWs are a valuable surgical option with similar long-term outcomes to primary abdominal closure after initial injury survival.

Since collecting patient-reported outcome (PRO) data are challenging among pediatric populations, parents/caregivers are often enlisted as proxies for reporting. The alignment between pediatric patient and caregiver perspectives based on PRO data is contingent upon context. We aimed to assess agreement between pediatric patients and caregivers surrounding perioperative education, expectations, comprehension, milestones, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We evaluated patient and caregiver responses to surveys between July 1, 2020 and July 1, 2021 from the ongoing stepped-wedge cluster randomized ENhanced Recovery In CHildren Undergoing Surgery (ENRICH-US) clinical trial for children undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. One preoperative and two postoperative surveys were administered that addressed patient experiences. Gwet&rsquo;s AC<sub>1 </sub>and Spearman&rsquo;s correlation coefficients were calculated, as appropriate, to assess the agreement between patients and their caregivers.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
During the study period, 209 patients underwent surgery in the ENRICH-US trial, and 196 (93.8%) patients and/or caregivers filled out at least one survey. There were 141 (67.5%) dyads of patients and caregivers who each filled out at least one of the same surveys, and 65 (31.1%) dyads of patients and caregivers who completed all three surveys. In the domains of education, expectations, and comprehension patients and caregivers had good agreement with Gwet AC<sub>1</sub> values of 0.80, 0.61, and 0.64 respectively. For milestones, patients and caregivers had very good agreement with a Gwet AC<sub>1</sub> of 0.95. Milestones measured whether patients achieved certain goals within a pre-specified time, including when and what patients ate after surgery (Gwet AC<sub>1 </sub>0.91 and 0.92 respectively), transition to oral pain medication from intravenous (Gwet AC<sub>1 </sub>0.94), getting out of bed (Gwet AC<sub>1 </sub>1.00), and return of bowel function (Gwet AC<sub>1 </sub>0.97). Spearman&rsquo;s correlation demonstrated good agreement between patients and caregivers on PROMIS pain questions preoperatively (0.71) and moderate agreement postoperatively (0.51). On PROMIS global health questions, Spearman&rsquo;s correlation demonstrated patients and caregivers had good agreement preoperatively (0.69) and moderate agreement postoperatively (0.65, Figure). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Pediatric patients and caregivers have strong agreement on survey items about education and meeting milestones, but moderate to good agreement on expectations, comprehension, and PROMIS measures. Caregivers&rsquo; responses may be acceptable when some patient-level responses are not available.

Biobehavioral interventions including relaxation, distraction, and mindfulness exercises have been shown to decrease perioperative stress and pain. However, use of these strategies are not well characterized among pediatric surgical populations. Our objectives were to quantify patient- and caregiver-reported perioperative exposure to and use of biobehavioral interventions in 18 US pediatric surgical centers and to evaluate associated outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Data were collected as part of the ENhanced Recovery In CHildren Undergoing Surgery (ENRICH-US) stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial for children ages 10-18 years undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery at 18 hospitals. Patients/caregivers were surveyed on receipt of information on biobehavioral interventions prior to surgery (exposure) and whether they used any exercises postoperatively (use) as well as perioperative nervousness. They also completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pediatric Short Form v2.0 Pain Interference 8a or the analogous proxy version. Patient responses were used when available, otherwise caregiver proxy responses were used. Opioid prescription and quantity at discharge were obtained from the electronic health record (EHR). Wilcoxon rank-sum test and chi-squared test were used.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 136 enrolled patients, 39% (n=53) of patients/caregivers surveyed reported preoperative exposure to biobehavioral interventions; however, only 5% (n=6) of providers documented these in the EHR. Exposure to diaphragmatic breathing (n=28; 21%) and distraction (n=24; 18%) were most common (Figure). Of 100 patients/caregivers (74%) who reported postoperative use, 60 used distraction, 55 used diaphragmatic breathing, and 29 used muscle relaxation. Those who used biobehavioral interventions were less likely to report increased nervousness postoperatively than those who did not use these techniques (7% (n=10) vs 26% (n=10); p&lt;0.01). Use of these techniques was not associated with level of pain interference (p=0.40), receipt of an opioid prescription at discharge (p=0.87), or median number of prescribed opioid pills (p=0.45).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Reported preoperative exposure to biobehavioral interventions such as relaxation, distraction, and mindfulness exercises by patients/caregivers were 7.8 times higher than documented by providers. Findings suggest that biobehavioral interventions may improve outcomes such as perioperative nervousness, but a larger sample size is needed to determine their true impact on pain interference and opioid utilization.

Currently, there is a wide variance in practice and no evidence-based guidelines exist. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between the duration of perioperative antibiotics and SSIs in the neonatal surgical population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review of patients less than 30 days old who underwent gastrointestinal, respiratory tract or urogenital surgery at a single children&rsquo;s hospital from 2014 through 2019. Patients who died on the day of surgery, those who required multiple surgeries on the same day, those who had dirty or infected procedures, and those who received long-term antibiotic prophylaxis for other diseases were excluded. Patient demographics, type and duration of antibiotics, type of surgical procedure, and wound classification were collected. The patients were divided into three groups based on antibiotic duration (no antibiotics, &lt;48 hours, &gt;48 hours). The primary outcome was the development of SSI. Continuous variables were compared between the three groups using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests. Variable importance indices to see the rank order of what variables are most important to the development of SSI were also done using recursive partitioning.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 155 patients who met our study criteria. The mean postmenstrual age was 37.77 weeks with a mean birthweight of 2.96 kg (Table 1). Of those 155 cases, 100 received perioperative antibiotics. Of the entire cohort, 12.26% developed an SSI. In the 80 clean cases, 45 did not receive antibiotics, 21 received less than 48 hours, and 14 received greater than 48 hours of antibiotics. The incidence of SSI in these 3 groups were 4.44%, 14.29%, and 14.29%, respectively (p=.30). Of the 75 clean-contaminated and contaminated cases, the incidence of SSI in the no antibiotic group was 0%, 19.05% in the &lt;48 hour group, and 18.18 in the &gt;48 hour group (p=.33). The variables in order of relative importance for SSI development were as follows: postmenstrual age (100%), age at surgery (71.41%), birthweight (62.3%), and length of antibiotics (47.87%).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Antibiotic prophylaxis greater than 48 hours was not associated with decreased incidence of SSI. Risk factors for SSI development were gestational age, birth weight, and age at surgery. These factors should be taken into account when considering SSI prophylaxis in neonates. Post-operative antibiotic duration greater than 48 hours likely does not confer additional protection to this special population

Chung<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Surgery, Dallas, TX, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Children's Medical Center, Pediatric Surgery, Dallas, Tx, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a stem cell derived malignancy originating in the bone or soft tissues most commonly diagnosed in adolescents. It is treated with a combination of chemotherapy with surgical resection and/or radiation for local disease control. Both surgery and radiation have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ES; however, there is limited data comparing outcomes in patients treated with these different modalities. The purpose of our study was to determine whether there was a difference in 5-year local progression, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) based on the modality used for local control.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients who were treated for ES at our pediatric institution between 2010-2020 were included for retrospective analysis. Demographics, age of diagnosis, primary tumor location and size, and information regarding chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical therapies, as well as patient response to these therapies, were collected from the medical record. Outcome measures were local progression, EFS, and OS at five years from diagnosis. Analyses were performed stratifying by treatment type with additional subgroup analyses by cancer stage, as well as primary tumor location and size.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We analyzed 61 patients with a median age at diagnosis of 13 years. 68.9% of patients presented with localized disease. Of these, 23.8% were treated with radiation alone; the remaining 76.2% underwent resection &plusmn; radiation. 52.4% of patients with localized disease achieved R0 resection. All patients received chemotherapy during the course of their treatment. Only 3 of the total 61 patients (4.9%) experienced local progression, and there was no difference in local progression between radiation and surgery treatment groups. Patients with localized disease who received radiation alone tended to have the shortest EFS (825 days), compared to patients who underwent R1 or R2 resection (1003 days), or R0 resection (1070 days); however, this was not found to be statistically significant. There was also no significant difference in OS between patients with localized disease treated with radiation alone or surgery &plusmn; radiation, regardless of whether or not R0 resection was achieved.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: There was no significant difference in 5-year local progression, EFS, or OS in Ewing sarcoma patients treated at our institution with radiation alone versus surgery &plusmn; radiation, regardless of whether or not patients achieved an R0 resection. As ES treatment is often dictated by institutional protocols, future directions could include a multi-institutional study to allow for further subgroup analysis with a larger sample size.

A limitation of this methodology is the inability for databases to easily share information. Linking data on the same patient from different data sources can take advantage of the strengths of each source to influence healthcare utilization, quality improvement, and health care policy. The purpose of this study was to validate linkage of The American College of Surgeons&rsquo; (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric version (NSQIP-P) and The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database using indirect patient identifiers and demonstrate the utility of the linked databases to enhance benchmarking using both risk-adjusted complications and cost per case data for postoperative intraabdominal abscess (IAA) formation following appendectomy for perforated appendicitis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: NSQIP-P and PHIS data from a single institution was extracted from June 2014 to March 2018. The dataset was linked using indirect identifiers gender, admission, discharge, and birth date. The linking algorithm was validated by medical record number (MRN). Following validation, those who underwent appendectomy for perforated appendicitis and were further classified into occurrence of IAA formation or not. Demographics, clinical outcomes, length of stay, and cost were analyzed. Statistical analysis employed the Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher&rsquo;s exact tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The linkage (NSQIP-P =4942, PHIS=32407 observations) yielded a 99.41% match for 4519 unique patients. Reasons for match failure (0.59%, n=29) included data entry error (0.18%, n=9) or missing discharge date (0.36%, n=18) in NSQIP-P, or missing encounters in PHIS (0.04%, n=2). Linkage validation by MRN matched 99.35% (n=4881). Mismatches (0.64%, n=32) were due to data entry error (0.24%, n=12), missing PHIS encounters (0.26%, n=13), or NSQIP-P matching more than one PHIS encounter (0.14%, n=7). From the linked dataset, 102 cases of appendectomy for perforated appendicitis were identified, mean age 10.80 years, 58.82% male, 82.35% Caucasian, mean weight 43.41 kg, 96.08% ASA &lt; 2, 74.51% sepsis, 5.88% postoperative organ space SSI, mean length of stay 4.15 days, Medicaid 62.75%, mean hospital charge $56,001. Development of IAA was more likely for male gender (n=6, 100%; p=0.041) and resulted in longer postoperative length of stay (8.17 days, p=0.016). Additionally, IAA resulted in higher overall charges ($92,791 versus $53,702; p=0.013), laboratory ($1,929 versus $973; p=0.036) pharmacy ($26,296 versus $14,914; p=0.012), supply ($8,827 versus $5,632; p=0.010), and other charges ($49,750 versus $28,960; p=0.011).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study demonstrated effective linking of NSQIP-P and PHIS databases. There is value in combining different databases, tracking outcomes, and identifying associated costs simultaneously to enhance comparative effectiveness research.

This leads to an abdominal wall defect (AWD)with amnion covered viscera outside of the abdomen. The clinical significance of this anomaly and its management vary considerably depending on the size of the defect. Small fascial defects result in umbilical cord hernias, whereas large defects result in giant omphaloceles with multiple organs outside the abdomen and loss of domain. Given the wide range of presentation, we sought to characterize our experience in management of this rare anomaly over an 11-year period.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients evaluated for an abdominal wall defect at a single tertiary children&rsquo;s hospital between January 2010 and January 2021. Infants with gastroschisis were excluded. Covered AWDs were classified as a cord hernia, small, or giant omphalocele. A giant omphalocele was defined as having a fascial defect &gt;5cm or large amount of liver in the sac. Cord hernias were surgeon described or smaller than 2 cm. Data analyzed included the time to repair and whether the repair occurred during the index hospitalization. We also evaluated the presence of major associated structural, cardiac, or genetic abnormalities and syndromes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 108 patients with covered AWDs. Of these, 37% (n=40) were cord hernias, 12% (n=13) small omphaloceles, and 51% giant omphaloceles (n=55). Major associated anomalies were present in 63% (n = 25) of cord hernias, 46% (n = 6) of small omphaloceles, and 24% (n = 13) of giant omphaloceles. In the case of cord hernias, major anomalies included intestinal atresia (5%, n = 2), Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (15%, n = 6), cardiac structural anomalies (48%, n = 19), and genetic anomalies (7.5%, n = 3). Percent repaired during index hospitalization and median days to repair from birth were as follows: 90% of cord hernias at a median of 1 day [1-353], 100% of small omphaloceles at a median of 1 day [0-6], 75% of giant omphaloceles at a median of 26.5 days [0-1929].

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: The range of clinical presentation of covered AWDs is broad, with a surprisingly high number of cord hernias seen at our institution. While cord hernias are typically associated with the least morbidity, a high percentage are associated with other intestinal anomalies that may warrant surgical exploration, not least of which are intestinal atresias. Furthermore, while the defect may be small, the association to other major congenital anomalies is quite high and must remain a critical part of workup and management.

Over 14 million children in the United States are obese, while many more are overweight. While multiple studies have documented that obesity increases the risk of postoperative complications among adults, little data exists on how obesity impacts surgical outcomes among children. Therefore, we set out to determine if overweight and obese children have different surgical needs than their non-overweight counterparts. Further, we sought to examine if overweight or obese children had worse clinical outcomes for specific surgical procedures.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective chart review of 875 patients between ages 2 and 18 who underwent surgery during 2018 at a tertiary pediatric hospital, based on an a priori power analysis, was conducted. Patients were stratified into 3 groups including &quot;obese&quot; (BMI &gt; 30), &quot;overweight&quot; (BMI 25-30) and &quot;non-overweight&quot; (BMI &lt; 25). Demographic information, medical comorbidities, perioperative data and post-operative complications were collected. A sub-analysis compared differences in children undergoing appendectomy and other gastrointestinal procedures. All categorical analyses were conducted using chi square tests while quantitative information was evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis testing, all at a significance level of p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Eighty-two patients were excluded due to lack of BMI data. Of the remaining 793 patients, 47 patients (5.9%) were obese, 78 (9.8%) were overweight, and 668 (84.2%) were considered normal or underweight (&ldquo;non-overweight&rdquo;). Obese patients were more likely to undergo tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy as well as appendectomy compared to their overweight and non-overweight counterparts (both p&lt;0.05). Additionally, obese patients were more likely to have a past medical history that included chronic lung, renal, or liver disease (p&lt;0.01). On sub-analysis, the rate of appendiceal perforation in those undergoing appendectomy was 16.1% in the non-overweight group vs. 81.8% in the overweight/obese group (p&lt;0.01). Interestingly, patients who were overweight or obese experienced more intraoperative blood loss during GI surgery than their non-overweight counterparts (60 mL and 70 mL vs. 22 mL, p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Children who are obese are more likely to require both tonsillectomy &amp; adenoidectomy and appendectomy than their non-overweight counterparts. During gastrointestinal surgery and appendectomy, overweight and obese children experience higher rates of intra-operative blood loss and perforation, respectively. Future efforts should seek to determine if overweight and obese children experience worse post-operative outcomes for other surgeries and what mitigation measures might help close these care disparities.

Islam<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Florida, Pediatric Surgery, Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are common on children and remain poorly understood. In adolescents and older children, FGID may manifest most often as dyspepsia, postprandial distress and constipation / diarrhea &ndash; also referred to as gastroparesis (GP), biliary dyskinesia (BD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Collectively, these conditions lead to multiple visits to physicians and hospitals and a frustrating delay in diagnoses. The two upper FGID, GP and BD, are more likely to be referred to and evaluated for surgical management. The purpose of this study was to compare a cohort of patients with GP and BD with those with cholelithiasis to better understand the differences in presentation and management as well as outcomes.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective cohort study was performed for all patients with BD, GP and cholelithiasis who required surgery at a single institution over a 10 year period. Inclusion criteria was the need for surgery, and patients who had their procedure at an outside facility or had incomplete records were excluded. Clinical characteristics, demographics, and management as well as outcomes data were collected and analyzed as a whole and in separate cohorts by condition. Comparative statistics were done with students t test and Fishers exact test.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 148 cases of FGID and 295 cholelithiasis patients were noted. The FGID group consisted of 57 BD and 91 GP, with 56 patients having both diagnoses in a metachronous fashion. A majority of the entire cohort (77%) were female, and white (69.3%) with a mean age of 15.6 years. The table notes that FGID cases had a significantly higher proportion of white race, as well as private insurance (used as a proxy for Socio-economic status) and a longer duration of symptoms before diagnosis. Comorbid diagnoses in the FGID patients were significantly higher as were the number of additional (other than primary) imaging tests performed. Comparing GP and BD, we found that GP had higher percentages of private insurance, duration of symptoms, comorbid conditions, and were significantly younger. Complete recurrence of symptoms were noted in 38% of BD, 22% of GP, and &lt;1% of gallstone patients at ~2 year follow up.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: FGID in children and adolescents take longer to diagnose, have more comorbidities, and tend to be white females with private insurance (proxy for higher SES) compared to patients with gallstones in our experience. In addition, the recurrence rates were substantial. Further understanding of this challenging group of patients may allow better patient selection for surgical treatment, in addition to elucidation of the etiology.

Gadepalli<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan, Division Of Pediatric Surgery, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The surgical management of hydrocephalus in neonates can be complicated by prior intra-abdominal processes such necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) due to intraabdominal adhesions or potentially increased abdominal infectious complications. There are no standard guidelines on the timing and type of surgical intervention for CSF drainage in patients with NEC. We sought to evaluate our experience with management of neonates with hydrocephalus and the impact of NEC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using a retrospective chart review (from 2010-2021), we identified patients under one year of age at time of first neurosurgical intervention for hydrocephalus with a history of NEC. We excluded patients who had an implantable reservoir, ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt preceding NEC diagnosis. Patients were stratified by whether they had medical management only or underwent surgical intervention (drain or laparotomy) for NEC. Data analyzed utilizing Kruskal-Wallis and chi-squared tests with a p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 17 patients with NEC, 10 required surgical intervention. Patients in the surgical group were younger at birth (26 vs 29 weeks p=0.02) and at time of NEC diagnosis (27 vs 3 5 weeks corrected p=0.03). Though, surgical intervention for NEC was associated with decreased use of VP for drainage of hydrocephalus (29% vs 80% p=0.03), there was no difference in adhesion burden at the time of VP shunt placement. Two patients (12%) had an abdominal infectious complication after peritoneal shunt placements, one in each group.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

In the largest cohort of patients with NEC requiring intervention for hydrocephalus, NEC severity did not predict difficulty or success of peritoneal shunt placements.

Due to their infrequent occurrence within the pediatric population, management of these lesions has been variable, and the risk of recurrence and or development of metachronous lesions remains unclear. The purpose of our study was to determine the incidence of diagnosis of a recurrent or metachronous benign ovarian neoplasm in pediatric patients drawn from a large multi-institutional pediatric database.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective data extraction from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database after obtaining approval from the Indiana University IRB. We queried the database for patients &lt;18 years old with a diagnosis of a benign ovarian mass or cyst (ICD D270 and equivalent ICD codes) who subsequently underwent an operation to remove the cyst, mass, and/or ovary. The primary outcome was diagnosis of a recurrent or new ovarian lesion, defined as readmission with additional ovarian procedure. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 1,967 pediatric patients who underwent surgery for benign ovarian lesions; of these, 56 (2.8%) had a readmission for ovarian neoplasm, and 15 (0.8%) required an additional operative intervention for excision of an ovarian lesion. The minority of patients underwent ovarian sparing procedures at index presentation (766 (39.0%)), with no significant difference in those admitted once compared to those with a readmission (39% vs 52%, p=0.052).The median age at index procedure was 13.8 [11.0-15.8] years, and the median time to recurrence for an additional procedure was 1.2 [0.85-3.20] years. Median hospital stay over all encounters was 2.0 [1.0-3.0] days. When comparing patients with a single admission to those with re-admission for benign ovarian pathology, the only difference identified in the PHIS database was median length of stay at 2 vs 3 days (p&lt;0.01). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Recurrent or metachronous benign ovarian lesions in pediatric patients are extremely rare, potentially obviating the need for long-term ovarian surveillance via interval imaging after initial resection of the benign ovarian neoplasms. Future work will incorporate a retrospective institutional examination of the same patient demographic to evaluate if these database findings can be corroborated. This will enable us to make stronger recommendations on the duration of postoperative surveillance for recurrence after resection of a benign ovarian lesion.

The incidence of inguinal hernias among premature infants can be as high as 30%; making inguinal hernia repair (IHR) one of the most common procedures performed in this group of patients. The optimal timing of repair, inpatient (IP) vs. outpatient (OP), remains debatable. We sought to compare the 30-day outcomes of IP vs. OP IHR in premature infants by querying a nationally validated and risk adjusted pediatric database. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective cohort study based on the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) database from 2013-2019 was performed. Infants who were born prematurely (&lt;37 weeks gestational age [GA]) and underwent an unilateral IHR were included in the study. Patients were grouped and compared based on those who underwent an IHR as an IP vs. OP. Demographic characteristics were evaluated between the two groups, and those that were statistically different provided the basis for the propensity score (PS) matching. Patients were PS-matched based on the following characteristics: GA at birth, age, and weight at time of surgery, American society of anesthesiology (ASA) score, cardiac risk factors (CRF), preoperative history of (h/o) bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)/chronic lung disease (CLD), oxygen support (OS), ventilatory dependence (VD) and nutritional support (NS).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 457 premature infants were identified. Mean age and weight at time of repair was 127 days and 4.8 kg, respectively. Most repairs were performed laparoscopically (61.1%); however, no statistical difference was noted when comparing IP vs. OP IHR. Patients who underwent IP, as compared to OP IHR, were more likely to be more premature (median IP GA 29 weeks vs. OP GA 32.5 weeks, p&lt;0.001), lower body weight at the time of repair, higher number of co-morbidities (BPD/CLD, CRF, NS, VD, and OS) and higher ASA score (p&lt;0.0001). Patients who underwent IP IHR were also noted to have longer mean operative time (OT) (67.8 min vs. 56.7 min, p=0.002) and anesthesia time (AT) (128.3 min vs. 108 min, p&lt;0.0001). Additionally, IP IHR was correlated with longer hospital length of stay (HLOS) (19.1 days vs. 1.8 days, p&lt;0.0001) and total number of post-operative complications (POC) (10.1% vs. 0.4%, p&lt;0.0001) compared to OP IHR. There were no mortalities noted within 30 days in the study population. After PS matching, 216 patients remained in the analysis. Analysis of the matched cohorts revealed a significantly different HLOS in IP IHR (7.4 days vs. 3.5 days, p&lt;0.001). Additionally, a higher number of POC were noted in the IP repairs (2.8% vs 0.9%), however this was not statistically significant (0.3). In the PS matched cohorts, no difference in OT and AT was noted.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

After PS matching of IP vs. OP cohorts, complication rates were similar, however HLOS was noted to be longer in the IP group. Future studies are needed to identify factors associated with longer HLOS.

Browne<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Lehigh Valley Health Network, General Surgery, Allentown, PA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Lehigh Valley Health Network, Lehigh Valley Reilly Children's Hospital, Division Of Pediatric Surgical Specialties, Allentown, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Appendectomies remain the most common pediatric abdominal surgery with room for improvement regarding cost effectiveness and quality improvement. Same day discharge (SDD) for uncomplicated appendicitis has been shown to have comparable 30 day complication rates, readmissions and ED visits. Despite this fact, the rate of SDD varies from 27-60%. This study aims to evaluate if the time of day of surgery correlates to and significantly impacts SDD in pediatric uncomplicated appendectomies at a single institution.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective study was conducted utilizing the ACS NSQIP-P database for laparoscopic appendectomies performed for acute uncomplicated disease from 01/2018 to 06/2020, after SDD protocol was initiated. Patients with prolonged stays due to medical reasons and complicated (perforated) appendicitis were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed for 30 day readmission, ED visits, surgical site infections, intra-abdominal abscesses, surgery end time and same day/next day discharge. Three time frames were designated to assist in evaluating time of day and associated discharge and were grouped as first third of the day (0000-0759), second third of the day (0800-1559), and last third of the day (1600-1159). Data was analyzed using chi-square analysis. 

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

After SDD protocol was initiated, 285 patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis. A total of 27% of these patients were discharged on the same day of their operation. The majority of SDD patients had their operations in the second third of the day (1.3%, 85.7%, 13 %; respectively, p&lt;0.0001) while the majority of next day discharges were in the last third of the day (6.7, 41.8, 51.4%; respectively, p&lt;0.0001) (Table 1). There was no significant difference in complication rates, readmissions, ED visits, SSI, or abscess between the two groups.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Same day discharge for pediatric uncomplicated appendectomy patients is becoming the standard of care with no significant variability in postoperative readmission and complication rates. Time of day of surgery that occurs in the last third of the day does appear to play a role in preventing SDD. At a single institution with the infrastructure for same day discharge at all times of day, the institutional culture remains more impactful on SDD than evidence-based protocol.

Corbitt<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Children's Medical Center, Dallas, Tx, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Over 100 conditions cause cholestasis in infancy including anatomic biliary obstruction, infection, drugs/toxins, inborn errors of metabolism, and prolonged parenteral nutrition (PN). Development of PN-associated cholestasis is associated with lower birth weight in infancy. However, the length of time to resolution of PN cholestasis has not been investigated in these infants. Further, PN-associated cholestasis is typically diagnosed after excluding other causes of direct hyperbilirubinemia (dBili) which unfortunately includes a battery of tests, imaging, and invasive procedures that carry increased morbidity for low birth weight infants. We aim to investigate the temporal resolution of PN-associated cholestasis in normal and low birth weight infants.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Following IRB approval, we collected retrospective data on infants (age &lt;12 months) admitted between January 2010 and January 2020. Infants with direct hyperbilirubinemia (dBili &gt; 0.4 mg/dL) were selected and stratified by birth weight. Infants who did not survive beyond day of life seven, did not receive PN, or who were diagnosed with a malignancy were excluded. The EMR was queried to identify infants receiving PN, total number of days on PN, and time to resolution of PN-associated cholestasis (days from measured max dBili to measured dBili &lt; 0.4 mg/dL) in infants receiving &ge;14 days of PN. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1700 infants with direct hyperbilirubinemia received PN, ranging from 1-to-515 days. Direct hyperbilirubinemia was positively correlated with number of days on PN (p&lt;0.05). We compared max dBili, days on PN, and time to resolution of PN-associated cholestasis among infants with normal birth weight (NWB, &gt;2500 grams, n=403,), low birth weight (LBW, 1500-2499 grams, n=161), very low birth weight (VLBW, 1000-1499 grams, n=41), and extremely low birth weight (ELBW, &lt;1000 grams, n=198) on PN for &ge; 14 days. The average max dBili measurements for each group were: 3.87 mg/dL (NBW), 3.34 mg/dL (LBW), 4.75 mg/dL (VLBW), and 4.09 mg/dL (ELBW). The average length of time to PN cholestasis resolution was: 42.8 days (NBW), 55.1 days (LBW), 73.9 days (VLBW), and 53.1 days (ELBW) (p=0.03). After correcting for total days on PN, there was no significant difference in time to PN cholestasis resolution between birth weight groups. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Normal birth weight infants received PN for shorter periods and also demonstrated faster resolution of PN-associated cholestasis during the study period. However, when corrected for total days on PN, we found that birth weight does not affect time to PN cholestasis resolution. More severe direct hyperbilirubinemia and longer time to resolution of PN-associated cholestasis are associated with longer periods of PN in infants.

Petroze<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Florida, Pediatric Surgery, Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Acute appendicitis is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission and surgical intervention in the pediatric population. The most common post-operative complication is intraabdominal abscess, which can require readmission and further procedures. Current guidance for the postoperative management of appendicitis discourages continuation of antibiotics post-operatively, except in the case of perforation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single-center retrospective chart review was performed for patients less than 18 with an admitting diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Data abstracted includes patient demographics, initial laboratory values, operative details, antibiotic choice and duration, and microbiology and pathology results. Adverse outcomes including readmission, post-operative abscess, and C. difficile infection were noted.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Between May 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, 219 patients presented with acute appendicitis. The mean age at enrollment was 12.33 &plusmn; 3.67. 133 (60.7%) patients were male and 86 (39.3%) were female. 23 (10.5%) patients were readmitted. Post-operative complications were noted in 15 patients (1 case of C. difficile infection, 14 intraabdominal abscesses). Of the 14 patients who developed an intraabdominal abscess, 11 required drainage. Culture of this fluid revealed pan-sensitive enteric pathogens in 10 patients and a negative culture in one patient. Figure 1 summarizes outcomes by pathology. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Laparoscopic appendectomy is a commonly performed procedure in the pediatric population. Overall, the risk of complication is low, but post-operative abscesses remain relatively common. Interestingly, the rate of post-operative abscess in our cohort is higher in patients with a gangrenous appendicitis than grossly perforated appendicitis. Likely, many patients with gangrenous appendicitis have micro-perforations that are not diagnosed intraoperatively or on gross pathology. Patients with diagnosed perforated appendicitis are routinely given post-operative antibiotics and have a longer post-operative length of stay. Conversely, gangrenous appendicitis is generally treated as simple appendicitis without post-operative antibiotics. These patients have a decreased initial length of stay but a higher risk of readmission. Culture data reveals expected enteric pathogens that are pan-sensitive. Routine post-operative antibiotics in gangrenous appendicitis would likely reduce the abscess rate in these patients.

However, they are also known to increase a patient&rsquo;s bleeding risk after trauma. Alcohol and other drugs are commonly detected among trauma patients. We hypothesized that intoxicated trauma patients on antithrombotic therapy would have a higher rate of falls and increased injury burden than patients who were not intoxicated.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We utilized data from an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma-sponsored prospective, multi-centered, observational study of 15 trauma centers to determine the prevalence and effects of intoxication on patients taking antithrombotic drugs. Intoxication was defined as positive urine toxicology for benzodiazepines, opioids, cocaine, PCP, barbiturates, or amphetamines. Patient demographics, injury burden, antithrombotic agents, and clinical outcomes were reviewed. Outcomes of interest were mechanism of injury, mortality, and hospital length of stay. Bivariate and multivariate regression statistics were performed using Stata v10.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Alcohol intoxication (BAC &gt;0.08mg/dL) was found in 133 (12.4%) patients. Urine toxicology (UT) was available on 646 patients with 196 (30.3%) positive, 58 (29.6%) having polysubstances detected. Intoxicated patients were significantly younger (59.7 vs 71.6, p&lt;0.001) and more likely to be male (73% vs 57%, p&lt;0.001); they were less likely to have been injured by falls (36% vs 79%) as opposed to other forms of blunt injury. Glasgow Coma Score among alcohol intoxicated patients was significantly lower (13.7 vs 14.2, p=0.03). Multivariate models of mortality, injury severity, and hospital length of stay did not demonstrate an independent effect of intoxication nor antithrombotic agents on our outcomes of interest.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Intoxicants are common among patients on antithrombotic agents. However, drugs and alcohol did not significantly impact patient outcomes or mortality.

Between April through June 2020, the period with largest number of COVID-19 patients in our hospital, the volume of patients in the ED decreased by more than 30%. We questioned if our trauma volume changed during this same time period.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We compared ED volume to trauma volume at our Level III Trauma Center, between April 2019 through June 2019 and April 2020 through June 2020 our busiest period of admissions for COVID-19 patients. The patients were entered into a relational database. We compared ground level falls (GLF), motor vehicle crashes including motorcycle (MVC), bicycle or skateboard crashes, assault, and other. We were able to use toll data as a surrogate for traffic volume during the same time periods. Comparisons were made using Chi-Square and the Unpaired student&rsquo;s t-test. Differences were considered significant for P &lt; 0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The ED volume was 6216 versus 9235 patients for 2020 and 2019 respectively, a 33% decrease. There was a 13 % increase in trauma volume in 2020 versus 2019, 308 versus 269, P=NS. When we compared trauma volume as a percentage of total ED volume, the percentage of trauma patients increased, 308/6216 (5.0%), versus 269/9235 (2.9%), 2020 and 2019 respectively, P &lt; 0.0001. The two most common injury patterns admitted to our Trauma Center are GLF and bicycle crashes, respectively. There was no significant difference in demographics or injury patterns between trauma patients presenting to our hospital during the two time periods. In addition, there was no significant difference in any outcome data between the two time periods. Interestingly, the number of MVC&rsquo;s was similar between 2020 and 2019 (24 versus 34, P=NS) despite the fact that there was a more than 40% decrease in traffic volume during 2020. In 2020 the number of crashes per vehicle on the roadways were 24/1.05x10<sup>5 </sup>as compared to 34/6.64x10<sup>6</sup> per vehicle on the roadway, a 37% increase in car crashes per traffic vehicle in 2020.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The trauma volume as a percentage the total ED volume increased during the first wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic. There was no difference in the types and percentages of injuries observed. Despite the fact that traffic volume decreased almost 40 percent between these two time periods, the actual number of motor vehicle crashes remained similar and the number of crashes per vehicle on the roadways increased. These data imply that during a pandemic, Emergency and Trauma Services need to understand volume and injury patterns to staff and resource allocate appropriately.

Given the link between increased stress and alcohol and drug use, our goal was to investigate admission trends and patterns of alcohol and drug use in trauma patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a single center, retrospective cohort study comparing trauma patients admitted before the pandemic (during March 16, 2019-March 15, 2020) with patients admitted during the pandemic (during March 16, 2020-March 15, 2021). Patients screened positive if they had a positive urine drug screen and/or a blood alcohol concentration &ge;10 mg/dL. We compared patient outcomes and injury characteristics of substance screen positive and negative patients admitted before and during the pandemic.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 3906 trauma admissions in the year prior to the pandemic and 3469 patients in the first year of the pandemic. There were no significant demographic differences before and during the pandemic with most patients being male (72%) and a median age of 39. There were significantly more penetrating injuries during the pandemic (13% vs. 17%, p&lt;0.001). There was no difference in the proportion of patients presenting with a positive UDS and/or BAC before and during the pandemic (28% vs. 28%, p=0.85). Among patients with a positive BAC, fewer had a result &ge;200 mg/dL during the pandemic (53% vs. 46%, p=0.003). During the pandemic, substance screen positive patients were more likely to present with injuries caused by motor vehicle collisions (16% vs. 21%, p&lt;0.001) or assaults (10% vs. 17%, p&lt;0.001) and were more likely to sustain severe injuries (Injury Severity Score &ge;16: 12% vs. 15%, p&lt;0.001) when compared to substance screen negative patients. A similar trend of increased injury severity was seen during the pandemic in the total trauma population as well (Injury Severity Score &ge;16: 11% vs. 13%, p&lt;0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite the theoretical risk of stresses during the pandemic leading to increased drug and alcohol use, substance screen positivity in our trauma patients upon admission remained stable. Additionally, the proportion of BAC positive patients with a BAC &ge;200 mg/dL has decreased during the pandemic. This study is limited in its scope, capturing all patients who screened positive, but without further information about the potential presence of substance use disorders. Further investigation of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol or substance use disorders among trauma patients during the pandemic is important as we face ongoing threats of closures due to a changing pandemic landscape.

 Cholecystectomies and appendectomies have long been considered the gold standard in acute care surgery. These procedures provide a service to the patient and help the community at large, as well as generate a source of revenue for the hospital and practitioner. Unknown to most in the surgical community, the COVID- 19 pandemic created a paradigm shift. Due to the prioritization of critically-ill COVID respiratory patients, there were less acute care surgical procedures being performed (i.e.cholecystectomies and appendectomies), thus creating an overall hospital revenue loss. We aim to examine the association between the decreased surgical volume from cholecystitis and appendicitis and its economic effect from pre-pandemic and post-pandemic months.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective data analysis of the patients who underwent cholecystectomies and appendectomies during the months of March 2019 to May 2019 compared to the same months in 2020. We used chi- square and t-tests to compare case numbers in 2019 to 2020.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

There were 345 patients who presented with appendicitis or cholecystitis to Elmhurst Hospital Center (EHC) during the months of March to May of 2019 and the months of March to May in 2020. There were three times as many total operations, or about 75%, in 2019 (261) in comparison to 2020 (84). 

There was a decrease in the number of admissions from 2019 to 2020 for both acute cholecystitis (149 vs. 43, respectively ) and acute appendicitis (112 vs. 41, respectively) without statistical significance difference (P=0.34). The largest decrease in the number of admission per month were observed in April 2019 compared to April 2020 (98 and 9 respectively) which was statistically significant (P&lt;0.01). This was followed by May 2019 compared to May 2020 [69 vs 20, P&lt;0.01 respectively], and March 2019 compared to March 2020 [94 vs. 55, P&lt;0.01 respectively]. 

Next, we observed a similar decrease in operative patterns with both cholecystectomies and appendectomies from 2019 to 2020 (68 vs. 13; 73 vs. 19, respectively) without statistical significance difference (P=0.45). The apparent decrease in the number of operations in 2019 to 2020 were for both inpatient setting [129 vs. 59 respectively , P&lt;0.01] and outpatient setting [132 vs. 25 respectively, P&lt;0.01]. 

As expected, there was six time reduction in revenue for both operations, cholecystectomies and appendectomies, in the months of March-May 2019 ($187,283) in comparison to March-May 2020 ($30,415). Nonetheless, when considering a six month aggregate, there was only about a two time reduction in revenue ($402,800 vs $191,948) . 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 

We observed almost three times reduction in cholecystitis and appendicitis during 2020 pandemic surge as compared to 2019 pre-pandemic data. In addition, the hospital lost over four times the amount of revenue in the same period.

Fox<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Cooper University Hospital, Trauma, Camden, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic was a potential threat to the viability of trauma centers and health systems in general. There was a concern that the bottom line of trauma centers would be negatively affected during this time despite the fact that the fixed cost of maintaining a trauma center persist. We sought to answer the question of how COVID-19 affected patient characteristics as well as trauma center volume, finances and viability.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We reviewed 6,375 patients admitted to our American College of Surgeons verified Level 1 trauma center during two time periods: pre-COVID (February 2019-February 2020) and COVID (March 2020-March 2021). 3,099 patients were admitted pre-COVID and 3,276 were admitted during COVID. Data including case-mix index (CMI), total contribution margin, insurance status, age, race, gender, ethnicity and injury mechanism were collected from the trauma registry and finance databases and analyzed. A p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were no differences in age, race, gender, ethnicity, injury severity score, injury mechanism or length of stay observed between the two time periods. Trauma admissions decreased intially during COVID but returned to and ultimately surpassed admission trends pre-COVID. Trauma revenue and patient acuity increased significantly along with a decrease in the number of underinsured patients during COVID (Table 1). When evaluating all service lines, the trauma center was the highest contributor to overall hospital revenue.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite a decrease in admissions for other service lines and a pause in elective surgeries during the pandemic, the trauma center remained unaffected. In addition, trauma was the most significant contributor to the bottom line of the health system. These findings underscore the need to maintain and even increase trauma center resources and staffing to ensure that optimal care is provided to critically ill and injured patients.

Although these mandated state-wide measures have been necessary to curtail the spread of the virus, little is yet known about the ensuant health consequences of such severe and widespread social distancing. Evaluating the shifts in trauma patterns during these unique conditions can help expose areas for improvement in hospital preparedness. Our goal is to investigate how the nature of traumatic injuries has shifted during the Lockdown and Phase 1 phases of the COVID pandemic. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a retrospective review of electronic health records of all trauma patients at Ochsner-LSU Hospital and separated them based on date of admission into Lockdown (3/22/20-5/14/20) and Phase 1 (5/15/20-6/3/20) groups. Data from the corresponding dates in 2019 were used as a pre-COVID baseline. Traumatic injuries were separated into 8 categories: vehicular collisions, falls, blunt assault, gunshot injuries, stabbings, self-inflicted injuries, animal-related injuries, and pedestrian injuries.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the 2020 Lockdown (n=129) and Phase 1 (n=129) periods, there was a 10.9% decrease in MVC-related trauma (p=.022) and a 10.0% increase in GSWs (p=.002) compared to the corresponding pre-COVID periods (n=173 and n=100, respectively). More alcohol-related trauma occurred during COVID periods than in pre-COVID times (p&lt;.001), with fewer alcohol-related injuries during Phase 1 compared to Lockdown (p=.020). However, there was no change in illicit drug-related injuries in Lockdown (p=.521) and Phase 1 (p=.210). Injury severity scores (ISS) were greater during COVID (mean ISS 13) vs pre-COVID (mean ISS 10) (p=.001). Finally, mortality rates were higher during Lockdown (p=.053) and Phase 1 (0.020) compared to pre-COVID, with a nearly 7-times greater likelihood of dying during Lockdown (OR 6.90) and a 4-times greater during Phase 1 (OR 3.96).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Significant shifts in trauma patterns became apparent during the early months of the shelter-in-place laws. The increase in GSWs and decrease in MVCs is an expected but significant finding, as more people were staying home and experiencing the effects of lockdown fatigue. The strong correlation between alcohol-related injuries and stricter quarantine restrictions suggests that further efforts should be taken to promote improved access to such vulnerable groups to counteract the effects of isolation on alcohol-driven trauma. The increased ISS and mortality were likely related to patient hesitation to venture out of the home and risk exposure to COVID, leaving only more severe injuries to be seen in the hospital; however, it could also be indicative of a strain on hospital resources during the pandemic. This study will be strengthened in its next steps by examining the Phase 2 and Phase 3 COVID data, which is expected to provide a richer picture of the trauma trends during lockdown conditions.

We sought to document the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PTSD in acute care surgeons and to identify potential contributing factors.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The six-item brief version of the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), a validated Likert-scaled instrument capturing PTSD symptomology was used to screen members of an acute care surgery professional organization using SurveyMonkey. Scores &ge;14 were considered a positive PTSD screen, which yields a sensitivity of 0.92&plusmn;0.19, specificity of 0.72&plusmn;0.06, and a diagnostic efficiency of 0.75&plusmn;0.06. Added questions gauged pandemic effects on personal and hospital systems-level factors. Stepwise linear and logistic regression were performed using only fully complete data from attending surgeons. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Complete responses of 334/360 attending surgeons were obtained from 2277 solicitations, with 58/334 (17.4%) screening positive for PTSD symptoms. Factors associated with higher PCL-C scores include increased administrative load, reduced research productivity, and rural practice setting (Table1). Increased odds of PTSD symptomology were again associated with less time for research (2.2[1.1-4.2]; p=0.02), and non-urban practice location (Suburban:2.7[1.2-5.8]; p=0.01; Rural: 4.8[1.8-12.9]; p=0.002). Additional contributing factors included increased ICU coverage (2.9[1.1-4.0]; p=0.03), non-male gender (2.1[1.05-4.1]; p=0.03), loss of bonuses (2.3[1.1-4.6]; p=0.02), and elective surgery cancellation (1.9[0.94-3.7]; p=0.08).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The prevalence of PTSD symptomology in our sample was in range with that reported from surgeon samples (15%-22%). In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, stress was not directly related to infectious concerns but rather to the collateral challenges caused by the pandemic. Understanding factors increasing stress in Acute Care Surgeons is critical as part of pandemic planning and management to reduce burn out and maintain a healthy workforce.

Kao<sup>1</sup>, C. Wade<sup>1</sup>, J. Harvin<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>McGovern Medical School, Department Of Surgery, Houston, TEXAS, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Dronabinol has increasingly been used as an adjunct in multi-modal pain regimens (MMPR) to treat acute pain after injury and minimize opioid exposure, despite lack of evidence in the literature. We hypothesize that dronabinol use is independently associated with decreased inpatient opioid exposure and opioid prescribing at discharge.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (NCT03472469) included 1,561 patients. The effect of dronabinol on inpatient opioid exposure (total morphine milligram equivalents [MME/day]) and opioid prescriptions at discharge (yes/no) were estimated with stratification by risk and regression. All patients who received and did not receive dronabinol were compared. To minimize indication bias, patients who did and did not receive dronabinol were evaluated in four high-risk subgroups: smokers, patients with a positive urine drug screen (UDS) on admission, patients who scored high risk on the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT), and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). For all patients and each of the subgroups, generalized linear models adjusting for differences in baseline variables estimated the independent effect of dronabinol on the outcomes of interest (total MME and opioid prescription at discharge).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

143 (9%) patients were given dronabinol. For all patients, dronabinol was associated with increased total MME (IRR 2.93, 95% CI 2.63-3.26, p&lt;0.001) and no difference in opioid prescribing at discharge (IRR 1.62, 95% CI 0.93-2.82, p=0.088). In the 377 patients with a positive UDS, dronabinol was associated with increased total MME (IRR 2.29, 95% CI 1.79-2.94, p&lt;0.001) and no difference in opioid prescribing at discharge (Table). In the 126 patients found to be high risk by the ORT, dronabinol was associated with increased total MME (IRR 3.39, 95% CI 2.76-4.18, p&lt;0.001) and decreased opioid prescribing at discharge (Table). For the 460 smokers, dronabinol was associated with increased total MME (IRR 2.55, 95% CI 1.94-3.35, p&lt;0.001) and no difference in opioid prescribing at discharge (Table). For the 525 patients admitted to the ICU, dronabinol was associated with increase total MME (2.82, 95% CI 1.86-4.26, p&lt;0.001) and increased opioid prescriptions at discharge (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

In this study, dronabinol was associated with increased opioid exposure in all groups, likely confounded by indication bias. However, dronabinol was associated with no difference or reduced opioid prescribing at discharge in two at-risk groups: those with a positive UDS and those screened as high risk by the ORT. This result indicates dronabinol may be beneficial in patients screened as high risk by the ORT and further evaluation is warranted.

As well, several

studies suggest blood group O may be associated with decreased SARS-Cov-2 infection rates and decreased

severity of illness. We sought to evaluate potential links among trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: After IRB approval, patients admitted 04/20-07/20 wereevaluated. Patients &gt;15 years old, presenting in

hemorrhagic shock, and who received emergency release blood products prehospital or in the trauma bay were

included. Patients who died in the emergency department or prior to collecting nasal swab for COVID were excluded. 

Patients were divided into group O and non-group O blood types. After analyzing all patients, we specifically evaluated

those who were COVID(+).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 417 patients met inclusion, 215 group O and 198 non-group O. There were no di!erences in demographics, mechanism

of injury, or injury severity. With the exception of scene systolic blood pressure (SBP) being higher in group O (median 110 mmHg

vs. 97, p=0.025), there were no differences in scene or arrival vitals, nor in resuscitation requirements. There were also no

difference in outcomes (30-day survival 80 vs 76%, p=0.325). Of the 417 patients, 7% were COVID(+). 19 were group O, 10 were

non-group O. There were no differences in demographics, mechanism, or vital signs, with the exception of higher scene SBP

(median 114 mmHg vs 89) and lower ISS (median 19 vs. 28) in the group O patients; both p&lt;0.05. Length of stay and

complications were lower and 30-day survival significantly higher in group O patients (TABLE).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The current single center study found no di!erence in outcomes or complications based on blood group among

Behm<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Guthrie Clinic, Trauma And Surgical Critical Care, Sayre, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The rampant spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lead to implementing nationwide shutdowns and strict social distancing mandates. Many urban trauma centers anticipated a decline in trauma volumes during this time therefore reallocating hospital resources away from the trauma department. Our rural center followed the urban centers&rsquo; recommendations. This study evaluates trauma trends in a rural level II trauma center during the pandemic. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective analysis of 1865 trauma admissions was performed from March 18 to November 15 prior to (2019) and during (2020) the US pandemic. Mechanism of injury along with Injury Severity Score (ISS) and basic demographics were collected. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare the data from both eras. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There was no difference in the total number of trauma admissions prior to and during the pandemic (953 vs 912; p &gt;0.05). A subgroup analysis based on mechanism showed total blunt traumas decreased (920 vs 858; p=0.02) while penetrating traumas increased (33 vs 54; p=0.02) during the pandemic. Within the blunt trauma subgroup, we noted a significant increase in all-terrain vehicle accidents (31 vs 50, p=0.025) and motorcycle accidents (71 vs 91; p=0.02). There was no statistical difference in the median ISS, falls and motor vehicle accidents across the eras (Table 1). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our rural trauma center reallocated resources away from the trauma service during the pandemic in anticipation for reduced trauma volumes. Our overall trauma admissions did not decline. We saw an increase in recreational vehicle crashes and penetrating traumas, the latter of which are typically associated with acute surgical intervention and thus would require more hospital resources dedicated to the trauma department. When considering the allocation of hospital resources during a pandemic, rural and urban trauma centers should consider their unique patterns of trauma admissions and population demographics.

Spiegel<sup>1</sup>, A. Monreal<sup>1</sup>, M. Darrabie<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Adventhealth Orlando, Surgery, Orlando, FLORIDA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Tracheostomy has many known benefits in the critically ill. Prior studies have shown that tracheostomy has been associated with reductions in ICU length of stay and less sedation. Outcomes following tracheostomy have previously been reported, however, the role and safety of this surgical intervention in COVID 19 patients is unknown. Due to the paucity of information, as well as the need to further characterize these patients, we sought to review the outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients requiring tracheostomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This is a single institution, retrospective review of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ICU who underwent tracheostomy. Inclusion criteria was those patients 18 to 99 years of age, diagnosed with COVID-19 via a positive rt-PCR test, on mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 14 days, who underwent open tracheostomy between March 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021. All patients underwent open tracheostomy in the same fashion. The data was analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics. Our primary aims were to describe the outcome characteristics and determine the safety of performing open tracheostomy on COVID-19 positive patients. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

91 patients with COVID-19 underwent tracheostomy split between 63 males and 28 females. The average age of the patient population was 59.56 years (23 to 91 years). We found that on average, patients underwent tracheostomy in 22 days after being intubated. Operative time on average was 29 minutes. 55.5% of patients required sedation after tracheostomy. In total, the average time of sedation needed after tracheostomy was 3.86 days, with the longest time on sedation being 34 days. Patients were taken off the ventilator in an average of 8.42 days with 63.6% of patients being off ventilatory support in 5 or less days. Overall, of the patients discharged, their discharge time after procedure was 17.5 days and with hospital stay of 40.4 days. Of these patients, it took an average of 12.6 days from tracheostomy to be discharged out of the ICU. There were 3 re-operations for complications in 30 days postoperatively. The overall morbidity and in hospital mortality rate was 15.3% and 10.9%. There were no reported cases of COVID-19 infection among the personnel involved with tracheostomies.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

With the concern of there being overwhelming admissions to the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of medical resources, performing tracheostomies on these patients can help provide more bed capacity and better utilize resources. The rate of morbidity and mortality in this population is similar to previously reported studies of tracheostomies performed on critically ill patients. There were no reported COVID-19 infections among all staff involved in the intra-operative care, which suggests this procedure can be done safely. Although all patients in this study were COVID-19 positive patients, there is a need for further subanalysis of special populations such as those on the support of extracoporeal membrane oxygenation.

Yon<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Sky Ridge Medical Center, General Surgery, Lone Tree, CO, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>New Hanover Regional Medical Center, Wilmington, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Based on recommendations by CMS, elective surgery was stopped during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergent surgical volume was also noted to decrease, raising concerns that patients were reluctant to seek medical care and were presenting in a delayed fashion with more serious disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the number of common emergent surgical procedures performed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and their complications. We hypothesized that the number of procedures would be less with increased complications. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A large clinical database from 185 hospitals was used to identify patients &gt; 17 yo who underwent operative procedures between March 2019 to May 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and March 2020 to May 2020(COVID-19 first wave). Data were abstracted regarding patient demographics and outcomes. Particular attention was given to five procedures: appendectomy, cholecystectomy, craniotomy, exploratory laparotomy, and ERCP. The number of procedures performed for each operation was compared between the pre-COVID and first wave COVID time intervals. These were compared using the G-test. Significance was defined as p-value &lt; 0.05. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

As expected, total operative procedures dropped during COVID (326,726 pre-COVID vs 237,809 first wave COVID). Moreover, there was a significant decline in each of the index emergent procedures.

Complications of each of these procedures were increased during the 1<sup>st</sup> wave COVOD period, including acute kidney injury, infection, SIRS and sepsis. Mortality was increased for exploratory laparotomy, craniotomy and ERCP, but not for appendectomy or cholecystectomy. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

There was a decrease in surgical volume of both elective and emergent cases during the COVID-19 pandemic first wave. This was associated with a concomitant increase in complications and mortality supporting the idea that patients presented to the hospital late with more serious illness.

At the peak of the first US wave, our tertiary, academic, 600-bed hospital transformed the SICU overnight into a dedicated COVID ICU while retaining all its surgical healthcare providers including housestaff, nurses, and intensivists. We hypothesized that worse outcomes would result from a SICU team caring for patients who are typically cared for in a MICU.

Methods

The SICU is a 24-bed unit managed by two intensivists (Trauma/Anesthesia), each with their own team of surgical nurses, APPs and housestaff. Patients are admitted postoperatively or for critical illness from surgical services only. Data was abstracted from a REDCap ICU database (which tracks 26 complications and mortality) for the dedicated COVID period and the periods before and after: Pre-COVID (2020pre, 1/21/2020-3/27/2020, n=223), the first COVID wave (2020COVID: 3/28/2020-6/2/2020, n=112), after the COVID wave (2020post, 6/3/2020-8/8/2020, n=244). Identical timeframes in 2019 (2019pre, 2019intra, 2019post) were queried as historical controls. Inter-timeframe comparisons were by Chi square testing for proportions and t-test for means. Due to unanticipated differences in 2020COVID population demographics (vs 2019intra), a second analysis stratified the same comparisons by race (African American [AA] vs. Non-AA).

Results

2020COVID patients were similar in age and sex but had higher APACHE II scores (Figure A), greater pulmonary (risk ratio [RR]=2.33), renal (RR=3.11), and sepsis-related complications (RR=4.23) and higher mortality (RR=4.08) (p&lt;0.05, Figure B). Other, non-COVID-related complication (cardiac, GI, neurological) rates were unchanged. 2020COVID had a significantly greater proporton of AA paients (p&lt;0.05, Figure C). 2020COVID AA patients were older than Non-AA counterparts (60.0+/-4.1 vs 54.4+/-4.0, p=0.05) and AA 2020COVID patients had higher APACHE II scores than any other group or period (p&lt;0.05, Figure D). Despite this, during 2020COVID, both AA and Non-AA patients had similar complication rates and mortality with both groups demonstrating similarly increased ICU length of stay and mechanical ventilation days (p&lt;0.05) when compared to other time periods.

Conclusion

COVID-19 care increased ICU resource utilization and care intensity. However, despite shifting from surgical care to COVID-19 care, surgical ICU teams were able to maintain similar key patient outcomes when compared to periods of non-COVID care. Knowledge and skill sets required for the unanticipated care of diverse critically ill patient populations should underpin the curriculum and blueprint for surgical critical care delivery.

Yu<sup>2</sup>, W. A. Guo<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>State University Of New York At Buffalo, Surgery, Buffalo, NY, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>State University Of New York At Buffalo, Biostatistics, Buffalo, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Controversy exists regarding the benefit of pan-scan approach in polytrauma. Chest X-Ray (CXR) provides expeditious detection of serious life-threatening injury. Chest computerized tomography CT (CCT) is more sensitive but is more time-consuming, adds on substantial charges and costs, results in harmful ionizing radiation, and leads to unnecessary further workup. In this study, we sought to compare clinical outcomes for blunt thoracic trauma patients who underwent CCT to CXR.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We queried the 2016-2018 TQIP database for adult patients who suffered blunt thoracic trauma and underwent chest imaging study within 24 hours of admission, using ICD 10 codes for CXR and CCT. Data were collected on demographics, length of stay (LOS), need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. We analyzed the data using propensity score matching, cox proportional hazards modeling, and logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The propensity score matching resulted in a total of 14,704 patients with equal number of patients in the CXR and CCT groups. There were no demographic differences between the two groups regarding age, gender, race, comorbidity and injury type. Although ISS was higher in the CXR than the CCT group, there was no difference in the thoracic abbreviated injury scale (AIS) among the CXR and CCT groups. There was no statistical difference in terms of hospital and ICU LOS, major complications (DVT, VAP and PE), and the 24 hr mortality. Logistic regression model demonstrated that patients admitted to hospitals with bed size of 201-400 (OR 0.806, 95% CI 0.747-0.869) and 401-600 (OR 0.831, 95% CI 0.775-0.892) were more likely to undergo CXR only, while community hospitals (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.31-1.35) and Level II trauma centers (OR 1.287, 95% CI 1.18-1.404) had a higher odds in the utilization of CCT (see figure). The Cox regression model analysis showed that the probability of death was significantly lower in the CCT group than the CXR counterpart (HR 0.629, Wald CI 0.482-0.821, p=0.0009).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While there was no difference in terms of hospital and ICU LOS, ICU admission, vent days, major complications and 24 hr mortality compared with CXR, CCT is associated with a signigicant mortality risk reduction. CCT as part of the pan-scan approach in blunt thoracic trauma patients likely detects injuries that require intervention and therefore improves outcome. Increases in hospital resource utilization appear justified by the risk reduction of death associated with CCT. Development of a decision instrument to detect important occult injuries while minimizing the cost, time, and radiation of CT is warranted.

The Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) trial enrolled patients within 2 hours of arrival to the emergency department for a trial of injured patients at risk for massive transfusion. We conducted a secondary analysis to determine how time to randomization affected patient outcomes and the balance between enrollment and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients from the PROPPR trial were compared based on 30-minute time to randomization intervals. Outcomes included 24-hour and 30-day mortality, time to hemostasis, adverse events, and operative procedures. Additional analyses were conducted based on treatment arm allocation, mechanism of injury, and variation in start time (arrival vs. randomization).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 677 patients were included. 387 (57%) patients were randomized within 0-30 min, 207 (31%) within 31-60 min, 60 (9%) within 61-90 min, and 23 (3%) within 91-120 min. Randomization within 30 minutes of arrival was associated with higher injury severity (median injury severity score 29 vs. 26 overall, p&lt;.01), lower systolic blood pressure (median 91 vs. 102 mmHg overall, p&lt;.01), and increased penetrating mechanism (50% vs. 47% overall, p&lt;.01). Faster time to randomization was associated with increased 24-hour (20% for 0-30min entry, 9% for 31-60min entry, 10% for 61-90min entry, 0% for 91-120min entry, p&lt;.01) and 30-day mortality (30% for 0-30min entry, 17% for 31-60min entry, 17% for 61-90min entry, 9% for 91-120min entry, p&lt;.01). There were no significant associations between time to randomization and adverse event occurrence, operative interventions, or time to hemostasis.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Increasing time to randomization in this large multicenter randomized trial was associated with increased survival. Fastest randomization (within 0-30 min) was associated with highest 24-hour and 30-day mortality, but only 57% of patients were enrolled within this time frame. Only 3% of patients were enrolled within the last 30-minute window (91-120 min), with none of them dying within the first 24 hours. For a more optimal balance between enrollment and mortality, investigators should consider shortening the time to randomization when planning future clinical trials of hemorrhage control interventions.

Decreased access to medical care, fear regarding the disease, and social isolation have the potential for negative psychophysical effects. This study examines the impact of the pandemic on long-term functional and mental health outcomes after traumatic injury.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients enrolled in a multicenter prospective study tracking post-discharge outcomes at 6 and 12 months after moderate to severe injury between March and July 2018-2020 were included. The cohort injured during the pandemic (March-July 2020) was compared to the cohort injured on previous years (March-July 2018 and 2019). We performed univariate and multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and trauma quality of life (TQoL), health related quality of life (SF-12), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PCL-5), depression (PHQ-8), and anxiety (GAD-7) 6 months post injury. 

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1,398 patients met inclusion criteria (577 in the 2020 cohort, 812 in the 2018-2019 cohort). In adjusted analysis, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of PTSD (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.54-1.27; p=0.38) and the SF-12 mental composite scores (mean difference -1.16; 95% CI -2.72-0.40; p=0.15) at 6 months between the two cohorts. There was also no significant difference in functional outcomes, including new functional limitations (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.67-1.11; p=0.24), inability to return to work or school (OR 0.94; 95% 0.62-1.42; p=0.78), and chronic pain (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.68-1.14; p=0.33). However, patients injured in March-July 2020 did score significantly worse on the SF-12 physical composite score (mean difference 2.21; 95% CI 0.69-3.72; p=0.004). Furthermore, these patients were also more likely to screen positive for depression (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.02-2.09; p=0.03) and anxiety (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.08-2.26; p=0.02) than patients injured in previous years. 

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients injured during the COVID-19 pandemic had worse mental health outcomes than patients injured prior, including significantly higher rates of anxiety and depression. Interestingly, the prevalence of PTSD was equal amongst groups. Furthermore, physical health outcomes did not vary significantly between the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods.

The Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) trial enrolled severely injured trauma patients predicted to require massive transfusion within 2 hours of arrival to the emergency department (ED). A separate secondary analysis of the PROPPR trial data revealed that all patients enrolled 90 minutes after arrival to the ED were less severely injured with zero mortality. We conducted a secondary analysis of the original PROPPR trial data to determine how a 90-minute enrollment window would have affected patient outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Any patient enrolled in the PROPPR trial more than 90 minutes after arrival to the emergency department was excluded from the analysis. The two treatment arms (1:1:1 vs. 1:1:2) were compared with additional analyses conducted based on mechanism of injury. Outcomes included proximate (1-hour, 3-hour, 6-hour, 12-hour, and 18-hour) 24-hour, and 30-day mortalities, as well as time to hemostasis, adverse events, operative procedures and transfusion requirements.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 680 PROPPR trial patients, 654 were included in this analysis. Of these, 321 were randomized into the 1:1:1 blood product transfusion group and 333 were randomized into the 1:1:2 treatment group. There were no significant differences in demographic or baseline characteristics, including injury mechanism, physiology, or injury severity, between groups. Randomization into the 1:1:1 group was associated with lower 3-hour mortality (6.2%, n=20 vs. 11.4%, n=38; p=0.02) and clinical administration threshold (CAT) (85.3%, n=273 vs. 92.8%, n=308; p=0.002) than the 1:1:2 group. Although not statistically significant, the 1:1:2 group consistently had higher rates of mortality across all measured time points (proximate, 24-hour, and 30-day) (Figure 1). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: With a shortened enrollment window of 90 minutes, analysis of PROPPR trial data reveals that administration of plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio resulted in significantly lower 3-hour mortality and less significant transfusion requirements (as measured by CAT) than administration in a 1:1:2 ratio. Future clinical trials on hemorrhage control interventions should select enrollment windows with careful consideration of enrollment numbers and severity of illness.

Given the magnitude of the pandemic, substantial resources were directed to combat the disease. Superimposed on the COVID-19 pandemic has been a concurrent worsening of longstanding urban gun violence. We sought to evaluate the impact attributable to these two major public health issues on the greater Louisville region, as determined by years of potential life lost (YPLL).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Utilizing the Collaborative Jefferson County Firearm Injury Database, all firearm injuries from January 1, 2011 to March 30, 2021 were examined. COVID-19 data was compiled from the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness. Pre-COVID (March 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and COVID (March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021) time intervals were examined. Demographics, outcomes data, and YPLL were determined for the groups and injury locations were geocoded. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 2011 to 2021, there were 5,275 firearm injuries in Jefferson County, Kentucky of which 82% were interpersonal, 8.9% unintentional, and 7.5% intentional self-inflicted (1.6% unknown). Interpersonal and unintentional firearm injuries increased concurrently with the COVID pandemic. During the COVID time interval, there were 4,574 years of potential life lost to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 9,722 YPLL to all cause firearm fatalities, and 7,898 YPLL due to interpersonal firearm fatalities (Figure 1). In the pre-COVID interval, there were 5,723 and 3,862 YPLL in Jefferson County as a result of all cause firearm fatalities and interpersonal firearm fatalities respectively.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In Louisville, greater YPLL were attributable to firearm fatalities than the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Given the impact of COVID-19 on our country and region, the robust response has been proportionate and appropriate and has decreased the overall burden of disease. The lack of response to firearm injury and fatality is striking in comparison. Additional resources to combat the sequelae of gun violence are needed.

Elkbuli<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>NSU, Miami, FL, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Kendall Regional Medical Center, Department Of Surgery, Division Of Trauma And Surgical Critical Care, Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Thoracotomy performed in the emergency department is a highly invasive emergency procedure reserved for severely injured patients with thoracic injury. The decision to perform thoracotomy entails high risk for the patient and the surgeon alike. Given the time-sensitive nature surrounding the decision to perform a thoracotomy in the emergency department, the evaluation of possible bias in affecting the decision to perform this procedure is important in order to improve patient management and outcomes. The aim of our study is to investigate possible trauma surgeon bias by analyzing disparities in the outcomes of traumatic injury patients who underwent an emergency thoracotomy in the emergency department.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of Adult patients (age &ge; 18 years) who suffered blunt or penetrating injuries to the thorax/abdomen/pelvis and presented to an American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT)-verified trauma center without or without signs of life betweeen 2016-2018. Univariate analyses and adjusted multivariate regression were performed with significance defined as p&lt;0.05.



<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 6,453 patients were analyzed. White/Caucasian patients experienced the lowest adjusted rates of thoracotomy (13.3%, p&lt;0.0001) and mortality (89.2%, p&lt;0.0001) and highest adjusted rate of being transferred to the ICU (10.3%, p&lt;0.0001). Medicare patients experienced the lowest adjusted rate of thoracotomy (8.3%, p=0.03) and highest adjusted rate of transfer to the ICU (21.4%, p=0.0003) whereas self-pay patients had the highest rate of mortality (97.8%, p=0.0004). Compared to male patients, females experienced significantly longer adjusted time-to-thoracotomy (0.14 vs. 0.11 hours, p=0.02) and higher rate of transfer to the ICU (8.9% vs. 5.4%, p&lt;0.0001). Among patient presentations, those who presented to the ED without signs of life after suffering thoracic and extrathoracic penetrating injuries suffered the highest adjusted rate of thoracotomy (29.1%, p=0.001) and mortality (99.2%, p&lt;0.0001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Racial minority and lower socioeconomic status patients experienced significantly higher rates of thoracotomies, complications, length of stay, mortality, and less favorable discharge dispositions. Our findings suggest that while the decision to perform thoracotomy and subsequent management &amp; outcomes is largely dependent on mechanism of injury and patient presentation, there is a possibility of physician bias playing a role. The implementation of interventions aimed at reducing provider bias and assessment of the effectiveness of these initiatives in direct relation to thoracotomy patient outcomes can serve to improve management and promote consistent, high-quality trauma care.

Examining interfacility transfer of trauma patients at the destination TC may provide explanations for the increasing trends of dead on arrival (DOA) patients at the destination facility. We aim to investigate trauma patients alive at their initial facility and then were DOA at the target destination following EMS transfer from one facility to an ACS-verified TC. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective study was conducted using the ACS TQIP dataset (2013-2018) for adult patients who were DOA following interfacility transfer. These patients were analyzed according to injury severity score (ISS), injury type (blunt vs. penetrating), EMS transport mode (ground vs. helicopter), EMS transport time, and level of TC destination (level 1=L1, level 2=L2). 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The majority of DOAs sustained blunt injuries, had a severe ISS (&ge;25), were male, and were aged 18-64. Patients with a low ISS (&lt;15) were more frequently transported via GEMS while those with a severe ISS were mainly transported via HEMS (p&lt;0.001). HEMS exhibited greater transport times to L1TCs and L2TCs compared to GEMS in many ISS groups regardless of injury mechanism. Decreased transfer times &le;60 minutes may reduce the number of patients arriving DOA after an interfacility transfer. Interfacility transfers were associated with a rising number and percentage of DOAs from 2013 (n=142; 0.25%) to 2015 (n=297; 0.32%) but decreased thereafter.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our study findings indicate that the majority of DOAs for trauma patients with blunt and penetrating injuries were transferred to L1TCs &amp; L2TCs from the initial facility, and the prevalence of DOAs was reduced when HEMS &amp; GEMS transfer time was &lt;60 minutes.

Thus, inherent biases may play a role in whether or not the EDT is performed. We aim to investigate racial, socioeconomic status (SES), and gender disparities in the use of EDT and to investigate outcomes of these patients to assess for possible surgeon practice bias.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A nationwide retrospective cohort analysis of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Trauma Quality Programs Participant Use Profile (TQP-PUF) 2016-2018. Adult patients who suffered blunt, penetrating, or other injuries secondary to falls/firearms/MVC/other mechanisms of injury and presented to a trauma center pulseless, with or without signs of life after injury. Rates of thoracotomy, time-to-thoracotomy, transfer to operating room (OR), ED disposition, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU-LOS), hospital-LOS (H-LOS), complications, mortality, and hospital disposition. Univariate analyses and adjusted multivariable regression were performed to account for confounders with significance defined as p&lt;0.05.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 6,453 patients were analyzed. EDT and mortality were significantly higher in minorities and uninsured patients, even after risk adjustment. There were no differences in timing among race groups to EDT. White/Caucasian patients experienced the highest rate of ED initial disposition to the ICU (10.3%, p&lt;0.0001) and lowest mortality rate (89.2%, p&lt;0.0001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Surgeon bias was not seen in the practice of EDT for patients arriving pulseless. However poorer outcomes were associated with minorities and lower SES patients. Thoracotomy rates were higher in minorities and lower SES patients due to more penetrating trauma.

Studies documented COVID-19&rsquo;s effects on urban trauma volume, including a rise in penetrating trauma. Additionally, studies demonstrated that the negative impacts of COVID-19 disproportionately affected minority populations, particularly Black and Hispanic populations. A trauma registry from an urban trauma center in NYC was used to compare demographics and injury characteristics of patients admitted during 2019 and 2020.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was conducted from a Level II trauma center. Jan. 1- Sept. 30 2019 and 2020 were compared. Out of 1,394 patients, 983 admitted to the trauma service were analyzed. Cohorts were subdivided into EARLY (March-May) and LATE (June-Sept.) subgroups, corresponding to phases of NY State and NYC response to the pandemic. Demographics and outcomes were compared between groups prior to and during the pandemic as well as EARLY and LATE pandemic phases. IBM SPSS was used for all analysis; categorical variables were analyzed using a chi-squared test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Trauma center admissions were similar between 2019 and 2020 (478 vs. 505, p=0.36). EARLY admissions were lower and LATE admissions higher in 2020 (p&lt;0.05; Fig. 1A, B). Percentage of Black patients increased in 2020 (Black-Hispanic 20.1% vs. 15.2% and Black Non-Hispanic 39.4% vs. 34.1%, p&lt;0.05). Percentage of White Non-Hispanic patients decreased in 2020 (16.4% vs. 22.6%, p&lt;0.05). Percentage of younger injured patients increased (26-35 years-old: 22.6% vs. 17.6%, p&lt;0.05) while patients &ge;66 years-old decreased in 2020 (19.6% vs. 26.4%, p&lt;0.05). During the pandemic, percentage of out-of-pocket payors increased in 2020 (6.0% vs. 1.6%, p&lt;0.05). A higher percentage of patients presented with worse Traumatic Brain Injuries in 2020 (GCS (3-8): 8.1% vs. 4.7%, p&lt;0.05). There was an increase in the proportion of penetrating injuries (27.4% vs. 20.8%, p&lt;0.05) and a decrease in blunt injuries in 2020 (72.6% vs. 79.2%, p&lt;0.05). MOI varied significantly between EARLY and LATE subgroups of 2019 and 2020 (Fig. 1 C-F).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The number of trauma cases between 2019 and 2020 were similar, while the demographics and patterns of injury for trauma admissions varied significantly following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. These variations highlight healthcare disparities among Blacks and Hispanics during the pandemic. In 2020, there were marked changes in injury patterns at this Level II Trauma Center. Particularly, there was an increase in non-accidental trauma, which seems to reflect a rise in violent crimes throughout NYC during COVID-19.

Using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), we asked whether ACA&rsquo;s expanded Medicaid coverage provision had any bearing on insurance coverage and outcomes for patients diagnosed with ankle fractures.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We defined 2012-2013 as pre-ACA and 2015-2016 as post-ACA. We delineated 2014 as a washout year. We identified patients aged 18-64 years with ankle fractures using ICD 9 codes. Exclusion criteria included poly-trauma and patients dead on arrival. We analyzed patient demographics including hospital payment source along with injury and institutional characteristics, length of stay (LOS) and discharge disposition - home vs. home with services or to a facility constituted primary outcomes of interest. We performed univariate followed by multivariate analyses.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 26,445 patients with ankle fracture; 13,864 (52%) pre-ACA and 12,581 (48%) post-ACA. For hospital payment source, 11% patients used Medicaid pre-ACA vs. 16% post-ACA, whereas 17% were self-pay pre-ACA vs. 14% post ACA (p &lt;0.001). We found the highest Medicaid expansion in the West region (23% post-ACA vs. 10% pre-ACA, p &lt;0.001), whereas the lowest in the South region (12% post ACA vs. 10% pre ACA, p &lt; 0.001). Mean LOS for all patients was 4.3 days and was higher for the post ACA group (5 vs. 3.6 days, p&lt;0.001). Compared to pre-ACA, post-ACA saw more patients being discharged to a facility (8% vs. 17%, p&lt;0.001) or home with services (9% vs. 11%, p&lt;0.001) and thus fewer to home without services (83% vs. 73%, p &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for age, Injury Severity Score, sex, race, ethnicity, region, insurance status, fracture type (closed vs. open) and trauma center level, multivariate analyses reflected increased odds for a longer LOS (&ge;4 days) - odds ratio 1.23 (95% confidence interval 1.16-1.30, p &lt; 0.001) and discharge to a facility/home with services for post-ACA patients (odds ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.53-1.75, p &lt; 0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: ACA&rsquo;s Medicaid expansion provision positively impacted patients with ankle fractures. Specifically the ACA improved resource utilization as seen by longer LOS and discharge home with services or to a facility.

Studying these disparities is essential to reduce preventable gun deaths. This study aims to determine the relationship between sociodemographic factors and firearms used in firearm deaths.



<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death Public Use Record from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) on decedents age 18 years or older who died in firearm-related mortalities from 2009-2018. The primary outcome was the firearm used (handgun; rifle, shotgun, or large firearm; other or unspecified). Factors of interest were race (White, Black, Native American, Asian or Pacific Islander), ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic), sex (male, female), age, marital status (single, married, widowed, divorced), education (no diploma or GED, high school diploma or GED, some college or associate degree, bachelor&rsquo;s degree, graduate degree), and place of death (inpatient, outpatient or ED, dead on arrival, other place). Factors associated with the primary outcome in univariate analyses were included in multivariate logistic regression models for assaults, intentional self-harm, and accidents with each firearm type.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 275,799 firearm deaths from 2009-2018, 3,372 (1.22%) were accidents, 174,658 (63.33%) were from intentional self-harm, and 97,769 (35.45%) were assaults. Forest plots of logistic regressions for handgun use and rifle, shotgun, or large firearm use are shown in figure A and B, respectively. Blacks were less likely to die from handguns (accident: OR=0.70, p&lt;0.05; self-harm: OR=0.84, p&lt;0.001; assault: OR=0.58, p&lt;0.001) and rifles, shotguns, or large firearms (accident: OR=0.30, p&lt;0.001; self-harm: OR=0.37, p&lt;0.001; assault: OR=0.28, p&lt;0.001) than Whites. People who earned at least a high school education more likely used handguns in intentional self-harm (high school graduate/GED: OR=1.09, p&lt;0.001; some college/associate degree: OR=1.34, p&lt;0.001; bachelor&rsquo;s degree: OR=1.33, p&lt;0.001; graduate degree: OR=1.37, p&lt;0.001) than those who did not.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Disparities in firearms used in firearm deaths exist by race and education. These findings could reflect disparities in firearm access across different communities. The data also suggest Black victims were more likely to die from unspecified firearms, which makes evaluating gun control policies, that typically restrict specific types of firearms, difficult. We will need more comprehensive data collection and reporting in order to reduce preventable gun deaths in marginalized communities.

Haines<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Medical advances have significantly increased the life expectancy among older adults in Western nations. Subsequently, the proportion of older patients requiring expert trauma care has risen proportionately. Considering this and given the paucity of literature, there is a need to assess factors associated with transfer disparities within this population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Trauma Data Bank was queried for patients age 65 or older and with an ISS (Injury Severity Score) &gt; 15 between the years of 2007 to 2017. Subsequent level of triage on presentation were grouped as follows: Group A: treated at a level I/II trauma center, Group B: initially evaluated at a lower level of care and subsequently transferred to a level I/II trauma center, or Group C: initially evaluated and remained at a level III/IV trauma center. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to quantify the association between patient outcomes and level of triage/care, and its relation to patient characteristics, including gender, race, and socioeconomic status.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Triage of 210,310 older adult trauma patients with an ISS&gt;15 showed significant findings. American Indians (OR 2.01 [1.76, 2.29]) had higher odds of being transferred to level I/II center while Asians (OR 0.41 [0.38, 0.43]), African-Americans (OR 0.58 [0.55, 0.61]) and Native Hawaiians (OR 0.69 [0.56, 0.85]) having lower odds of being transferred to level I/II center when compared to Caucasians, (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, women were more likely to remain at an ACS III/IV center (OR 1.09 [1.04, 1.14]), (p&lt;0.001). Insurance status was also significantly related to transfer status, with self-pay (uninsured) being less likely to be transferred to a higher level of care (OR 0.68 [0.63, 0.72]); however, this was also demonstrated in private insurance holders (OR 0.67 [0.66, 0.69], p&lt;0.001). We observed that patients who were transferred to ACS I/II centers overall had significantly lower odds of dying. In contrast, Caucasians had significantly higher odds of mortality, with African-Americans (OR 0.82 [0.77, 0.88]) and American-Indians (OR 0.73 [0.59, 0.91]) having significantly lower odds of dying (p&lt; 0.001). Private insurance holders (OR 0.79 [0.76, 0.82]) had significantly lower odds of mortality in comparison to self-pay patients (OR 1.57 [1.43, 1.72]), (p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Socioeconomic status, specifically access to insurance, plays a significant role in triage decisions associated with older adults sustaining trauma, with subsequent association with mortality. Factors such as race and gender, though influential, were found to be less likely to influence triage decisions.

These interactions are part of LEOs mission to protect public safety and can benefit patients in some circumstances. However, both patients and clinicians have also reported disruptions to clinical care, interference with privacy, and additional stress and trauma when LEOs are present during ED care. Systems of structural racism in the US that expose patients of color to intensive policing have been shown to worsen racial health disparities to which law enforcement activity in the ED may further contribute. Still, little is known about the frequency and context of law enforcement activity in emergency care settings. To quantify this phenomenon, we conducted an observational study of LEO presence in the ED.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted systematic social observations of patient-clinician-LEO interactions from 7/6-8/6/2021, 7am-7pm, Monday-Sunday and on 12 additional evening observation periods from 8pm-12am at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center. Nine trained observers noted the time, place, and duration of encounters using a standardized recording instrument. Subsequent to observation, patient medical records were queried for patient&rsquo;s chief complaint, demographic information, ED length of stay and disposition.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: LEOs interacted with 77 patients both directly, in conversation or physical contact, and indirectly, waiting outside or guarding patient rooms (patient median age 29, 73% male, 64% Black). The most common chief complaint was gunshot wound (39%) and motor vehicle crash injuries (21%). A total of 140 direct interactions were observed with a median of 1 interaction per patient (Interquartile range [IQR] 1-3). Direct interactions with patients (n=51) and clinicians (n=46) lasted on average 5 and 2.5 minutes respectively. There were a median 2 LEOs per patient (IQR 1-3). In 4 cases (5%), the patient was a LEO accompanied by additional LEOs. During 348 total observed hours, at least one LEO was present in the ED for 108.4 hours (31% of time observed). 67% of interactions occurred in the ED trauma bay and 33% in the main ED.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: LEO presence is common in the ED of an urban, academic, Level I trauma center and frequently occurs with patients who are not in custody or under investigation. Little policy exists to guide their interactions in these cases, which leaves room for considerable variation in their encounters and treatment. It is incumbent upon the healthcare system to protect patient privacy, safety, and rights by establishing limits for law enforcement activity within clinical space.

As the geriatric population increases in number, so does the incidence of geriatric trauma. Our urban, safety-net trauma center treats geriatric patients with healthcare needs influenced by their social determinants of health. This study aims to characterize penetrating trauma in this population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Data on demographics, injury characteristics, condition on admission, and clinical outcomes were collected on all patients &ge;55 years old with penetrating injuries treated at our hospital between 2010 and 2019. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of this population and univariate analysis to test for associations between variables. Data was stratified by insurance type, intoxication status, and injury intent. Univariate analysis was performed using Pearson&rsquo;s chi square and Fisher-Freeman-Halton tests as appropriate for categorical variables and one-way ANOVAs for numerical variables. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Among 101 patients, average age was 60.7 (&plusmn;6.73) years and 83% were male. The racial/ethnic breakdown reflected the diversity of our population (49% Black, 27% White, 11% Hispanic). In most patients, injury severity score was below 16 (82%), length of stay was short (4.25&plusmn;7.32 days), and discharge was to home (70%).

Analysis showed that the majority of patients had government-sponsored insurance (57%), and many patients were intoxicated on presentation to the hospital (44%). Patients with self-inflicted injuries mainly suffered from injuries to the head/neck (50%, p&lt;0.001), had a longer length of stay than those assaulted (9.27&plusmn;12.96 vs 2.76 &plusmn;3.97 days, p&lt;0.001), and were more often discharged to mental health facilities (64%, p&lt;0.001). Mortality was higher in patients with no insurance than government or private insurance (30% vs 3.4% vs 8.7%, p=0.004).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Geriatric trauma patients are known to have worse outcomes than their younger counterparts. Though most patients had minor injuries and were discharged home in the studied population, these risks are exacerbated by socioeconomic variables such as insurance status and substance use disorders. Hospital stays were longer in patients with government insurance, and mortality was highest among the uninsured. Though patient outcomes did not appear to vary by intoxication status, intoxicated older adults were disproportionately impacted by penetrating traumatic injuries. Further work is needed to better understand these associations found by univariate analysis in a small study size. Self-inflicted penetrating traumatic injuries were redemonstrated as a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality with longer hospital stays. Due to the healthcare barriers faced by this population, geriatricians and trauma surgeons must be proactive and aggressive in their interventions to reduce traumatic injury and improve patient outcomes.

The use of telehealth services has been shown to decrease travel cost, lost time and wages, and increase patient satisfaction. However, the majority of studies were performed in urban settings, among non-surgical patients and did not address the barriers or limitations of patients in rural settings. Incorporating telehealth services among our patients will facilitate compliance with follow-up, provide better access, and enhance patient education. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of telehealth services in our patient population and to gain an understanding of our patients&rsquo; perception of and barriers.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a prospective cohort study utilizing the administration of a brief questionnaire to patients &gt;18 years old admitted to the hospital on the Trauma and Acute Care Surgery services prior to discharge or at the first clinic visit. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of our respondents, 51% were male and 49% were female with a mean age of 44 years. 34% were commercially insured, 23% had Medicare, 11% Medicaid, and 14% were uninsured. In regards to accessing the internet, 89% of patients reported access to the internet at home and 87% use a cellphone as the primary device. When asked which locations they felt comfortable using telehealth, 85% reported comfort with using telehealth at home, 4.3% at a cafe, and 10% at a public library. 70% of respondents had no prior experience with telehealth. 47% would use telehealth services if offered by the PCP and 39% were neutral. 39% agree telehealth will improve the care they receive, 32% agree that telehealth will decrease the care they receive while 26% disagree. 35% agree that telehealth will help improve their understanding of medical conditions while 15% disagree. 61% agree that telehealth will provide faster access to a HCP while 2% disagree. 39% agree that they will receive the same care with telehealth while 24% disagree.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In a rural state where the majority of our patients live a significant distance from the hospital, the utilization of telehealth offers attractive options for both patient and provider. Barriers to such services, such as internet access, was not an issue for the majority of respondents. Our study emphasizes existing data that telehealth services would increase patients&rsquo; understanding of their medical care and conditions. The perception of telehealth appears to be the greatest barrier to utilization, as the majority of patients were concerned that the level of care they receive would decrease using telehealth. Such perceptions, however, can be improved with increased familiarity and education on telehealth services. We believe that offering telehealth services as an adjunct tool after discharge from the hospital is both feasible and promising.

Myers<sup>1</sup>, C. G. Velopulos<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, GI, Trauma, And Endocrine Surgery, Aurora, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Physical violence is pervasive in United States jails and prisons and can lead to violent death. We sought to better characterize trauma-associated deaths of the American incarcerated population through legal intervention or death by guards, police, deputies, and sheriffs by examining the preceding events leading up to violent death, use of restraints and force, demographic features of the victims, and proceeding events such as initiation of medical care. We then compared incarcerated to non-incarcerated individuals in the course of interaction with legal intervention to identify opportunities for injury prevention.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a report utilizing the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) data from the years 2003-2019. We identified deaths that occurred while in custody or incarceration from legal intervention, extracting demographic information including age, race/ethnicity, sex, completed level of education, and mental health history. Event information included weapon type, location of death, incident type, incarceration status, use of restraints, and prone positioning. Narrative reports were utilized to extract information that were not a predefined NVDRS variable. We compared those who were already incarcerated to those who were not.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We included 86 victims that died from legal intervention in the analysis. All victims in our cohort were male and race was a significant factor for death by legal intervention, with Black men constituting 33.7% (p&lt;0.001). During altercations 34.89% (n=30) of victims were placed in restraints with 5 (5.81%) in prone positioning. Comparing incarcerated to non-incarcerated victims, non-incarcerated victims trended toward less restraint use, and were significantly more likely to be reported as having a weapon. Although firearm was the predominant means overall, it was much more likely to be used in dealing with non-incarcerated victims (83.3% vs. 44.6%, p=0.0006).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We found that homicide victims during legal intervention were most likely to be male and white, non-Hispanic; however, Black victims were disproportionately represented in legal intervention deaths compared to their representation in the general population. Additionally, application of restraints, prone positioning, and use of force were important preceding events suggesting these tactics as risk factors for death by legal intervention requiring further investigation. Our findings reinforce that prevention methods should focus on de-escalation, reducing prone positioning, and reexamining restraint practices. Our number of victims may also reflect bias in accurately reporting circumstances of death, which we will further investigate.

Healthcare disparities in pediatric trauma can affect overall morbidity and mortality. However, there is a paucity of data to describe how socioeconomic characteristics and neighborhood disadvantage correlate with specific injuries and outcomes. The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage to bicycle safety and trauma outcomes among pediatric bike vs. auto injuries.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Patients &le;18 years old with bike vs. auto injury mechanism from a Level 1 pediatric trauma center admitted from January 2008-December 2018 were evaluated. Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was used to measure neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage based on patient home address. Patient demographics, injury, and clinical data characteristics [admit Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), and Abbreviated Injury Scores (AIS)] were analyzed. Outcomes included hospital length of stay, ICU admission, complications, hospital readmission, and mortality. Traffic scene data from the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS) were matched to clinical records. Bicycle safety was assessed by helmet usage, road conditions, and the presence of bike lanes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess demographic characteristics related to helmet usage.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 321 patients were evaluated, 84% male, median age of 12 years [IQR 9-13], and 44% were of Hispanic ethnicity. Hispanic ethnicity was greater in the most disadvantaged ADI groups (69%), compared to the middle (13%), or least disadvantaged ADI groups (18%; p&lt;0.001). There were no differences in admit GCS, ISS, length of stay, ICU admission, complications, readmission, or mortality by ADI, although there was a significant difference in Head and Neck AIS by ADI (p=0.01). Mortality occurred in two patients and most (96%) were discharged to home. Of the SWITRS matched traffic records, 14% of collisions occurred in non-daylight and 79% were at locations without a bike lane. The most disadvantaged ADI group was least likely to have worn a helmet (see Figure 1; p&lt;0.001). Hispanic ethnicity and highest deprivation group were independently associated with lower odds of wearing a helmet (AOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-0.9, p=0.03; AOR 0.33 95% CI 0.17-0.62; p=0.001), while patient age and sex were unrelated to helmet usage.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Outcomes for bike vs. auto trauma remain similar across all ADI groups. However, bike helmet usage is significantly lower among children from greater disadvantaged neighborhoods. This research may help support targeted local education and prevention programs to improve bike safety and helmet usage among those at increased risk.

Recent studies have suggested that an initial SBP in the range of 90-110 mmHg in a trauma patient may be associated with poor patient outcome. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of HS patients presenting with an ED SBP between 90-110 mmHg and those with SBP&gt;110 mmHg.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective review of TQIP 2017. Patients (&ge;18yrs) with HS were identified. Shock was defined as SBP &le;90&thinsp;mmHg measured within 1 hour of arrival in all patients who received transfusions. Patients were stratified based on their first recorded SBP within 30 minutes or less of arrival. First SBP was examined and compared against the primary outcome of mortality. The associations between ED SBP and mortality, complications, and transfusions were further examined by backward stepwise regression analyses.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 10,438 (SBP 90-110: 3,600 &amp; SBP&ge;110: 6,838) HS patients were identified. Mean age was 47yrs, 72% were male, and 75% of injuries were blunt. Mean ED SBP was 100 vs. 136 mmHg and mean lowest SBP was 70 vs. 68 mmHg respectively. Median ISS was lower for the first group (22 vs. 24) with similar body distribution. Overall mortality was 23%, 25.6% underwent laparotomy, and 18.2% angioembolization. There were no differences in hemorrhage control interventions, times to intervention, in-hospital complications, transfusion requirements, and hospital LOS, between the two groups. On regression analyses, SBP between 90-110 was not associated with a mortality reduction (OR 1.01;p=0.862).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In our study we showed that 1 in 5 patients presenting with HS eventually die. 2/3 of patients who progress to HS have a normal ED SBP. This data suggests that blood pressures before the onset of shock are not associated with patient outcomes.

Velopulos<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, GI, Trauma, And Endocrine Surgery, Aurora, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The pervasiveness of physical violence in the United States justice system often leads to injury and even violent death for those who are incarcerated. The purpose of this project is to better clarify the differences in death during incarceration between males and females, delineating the differences in demographic features and the circumstances of the violent death including location, injury pattern, and perpetrator. This analysis included legal intervention deaths (victim in custody or in process of custody) including homicide and suicide deaths. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a report utilizing the multi-state National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) data from the years 2003-2019. The NVDRS collects data on all deaths of violent nature. This includes homicides which include legal intervention deaths which apply to any violent death from a police officer, sheriff, guard, or other law enforcement officer. Data are abstracted from both coroner/medical examiner reports as well as legal proceedings on the demographics of both victims and perpetrators, type of weapon used, and other circumstances of fatal injury. Deaths occurring during incarceration or in process of legal intervention were compared for males and females including demographic characteristics of victims and features surrounding the violent death incident. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, there were 4386 victims of violent death in our analysis with 371 female victims and 4015 male victims. There were 3440 victims of suicide, with 333 female victims and 3107 male victims; suicide was the most common cause of death during incarceration for both females and males (89.756% vs 77.38%; p&lt;0.001). Homicide was less common in females (1.62% vs 14.79%; p&lt;0.001) and legal intervention only occurred in males (2.17%; p&lt;0.001). Male victims were more likely to be nonwhite race/ethnicity, while females were more likely to be experiencing homelessness and have documented mental illness (Table).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Most homicide deaths during incarceration occurred in male victims. Suicide was the most likely cause of violent death for both men and women, but was the primary cause for women (89.76%). Women were also more likely to be white, have documented mental illness, and die by poisoning. This study indicates different patterns of homicide during incarceration and legal intervention based on sex, conferring different risk factors considering both demographics and environment. Distinct prevention strategies must take into account how each sex experiences the American justice system.

Velopulos<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, GI, Trauma, And Endocrine Surgery, Aurora, CO, USA","Background: Contrary to popular belief immigrant enclaves produce less crime than other areas of the United States, yet that does not mean they cannot be the victims of violent crime. The purpose of this project is to better characterize the victims of homicides in this population. Specifically, we sought to compare differences in victim demographics, injury patterns, and circumstances of violent death for the immigrant population to native-born victims of homicide. Ultimately, we sought to identify potential intervention strategies for this vulnerable population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We queried the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) data from the years 2003-2019 for deaths in victims who were coded as born outside of the United States. We defined immigrants as anyone born outside of the U.S. We extracted demographic information including age, race/ethnicity, means of homicide, and circumstances surrounding the event to compare immigrant to non-immigrant deaths.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Immigrant victims were less likely to be killed by a firearm and were less likely to have substance use or alcohol implicated. They were more likely to be killed during multiple homicide events that involved suicide of the perpetrator, more likely to be killed during the perpetration of another crime, more likely to be killed by a stranger, and more likely to be killed in a commercial setting such as a grocery store or retail outlet (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Our analysis indicates immigrants are more likely to be victims of during the perpetration of a crime in a commercial setting such as a grocery store or retail outlet by a stranger. Moreover, immigrants are more likely to be a victim in multiple homicide events followed by suicide of the perpetrator. Therefore, injury prevention measures for this population require different techniques focusing on distinct features of victimization centered on random acts in contrast to native-born citizens who tend to be victims of people they know.

Combining social vulnerability data with trauma incidence rates and geographic analysis can help identify regions that could benefit from targeted trauma system interventions. This study combines the SVI with choropleth maps and funnel plots in order to better understand the intersection between social vulnerability and geographic trauma incidence.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective analysis of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) transport data of adult patients in Alabama from July 2015 through June 2020. A choropleth county map was constructed based on SVI score and separated into six regions as defined by the EMS trauma system. Funnel plots were constructed to relate incidence rate to county population, with subgroups formed based on SVI quartile. High outliers were defined as county incidence rates that fell outside the 95% confidence interval. Additional analyses included patients with critical physiology, and those with penetrating, blunt, and burn traumas. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 65,247 trauma incidents occurred during the study period, with a statewide incidence rate of 133 per 10,000 persons. All (n=17) counties in the 4<sup>th</sup> SVI quartile were located in either the West, Southeast, or Gulf (southwest) regions, while none of them were present in the North, Central, or East regions of the state. 11 out of 16 lowest vulnerability (Q1) counties were located in the North, East, and Central regions, with only one of the lowest vulnerability counties located in either the West or Gulf (southwest) regions. Per 10,000 persons, the penetrating trauma incidence was 8.7, 10.7, 13.1, and 12.5 for SVI quartiles 1-4, respectively. 6 out of 17 counties in the 4<sup>th</sup> SVI quartile were high outliers for penetrating injury incidence, compared to 3 of the 17 counties in the 3<sup>rd</sup> SVI quartile, and 1 of 17 and 1 of 16 counties, respectively, for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 1<sup>st</sup> quartile. There were no significant differences between overall, blunt, burn, or critical injuries between SVI quartiles.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The most vulnerable counties in Alabama are all located in the southern and western portions of the state, with the least vulnerable counties clustered in the north, central, and eastern regions. Counties with higher vulnerability were more likely to be high outliers for penetrating trauma incidence than low vulnerability counties, although this finding only trended toward significance.

After serious injury, patient autonomy is often compromised due to fluctuating consciousness and shifting provider focus on surrogates for decision-making. The frequency and type of ethical dilemmas arising in traumatology is unknown. This study aims to better characterize the frequency and type of ethical dilemmas after serious injury. As a descriptive study, our hypothesis is that there is a differential pattern identifiable in trauma-related ethics consultations that is not established in current literature.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: After obtaining IRB approval, all ethics consults regarding trauma patients from January 2014 to January 2021 were reviewed using a qualitative approach from a secure RedCap database developed and managed by a single center ethics consultation service. Representative consult summaries which included ethics issues addressed and consultant&rsquo;s advisory comments were distributed among researchers who independently generated thematic codes. These were aggregated to create a codebook, which was applied to all consult summaries. Iterative and emergent thematic analyses were done to coding results.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 167 trauma patients within the ethics consult database. Most consults were requested by the social worker (25%) and primary attending physician (20%). The highest requests for an ethics consult were Concerns Regarding Surrogates (66%) and Appropriateness of Clinical Care (49%). Consults were placed to help the clinical team clarify hospital policies (72%), resolve conflicts within the clinical teams or between the team and patient families (37%), and clarify goals of care (31%). Most consults tied queries to a litigious impact (73%). A minority of consults had no clear ethical question but served as a written outlet of emotions for the clinical team (13%).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This qualitative study found clear patterns in trauma-related ethics consultations. Our results identified Surrogate Decision Makers and Appropriateness of Care as the two most common ethical problems in a cohort of trauma patients. Future studies should seek to further elucidate the actual incidence of ethical issues that characterize trauma care across multiple centers, and possibly explore parallel issues in non-trauma acute care surgery. Larger epidemiologic patterns may identify modifiable factors that improve resource allocation (e.g., dedicated palliative care, social workers) toward trauma care.

Due to their rarity, RMS are not well characterized. We sought to compare rampage (RMS) and non-rampage (NRMS) mass shooting demographics (victim/perpetrator), time of day, and location.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An open-source database, Gun Violence Archive, was queried for mass shootings from 2014-2018. Mass shooting was defined as 4 or more victims shot at a single event. Source media reports were accessed for data collection. Chi Square was used to compare dichotomous data and T-test for continuous. P&lt;0.05 was significant and Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 31 RMS and 1642 NRMS. RMS had more victims per incident (32.1 &plusmn; 88.8 vs 4.9 &plusmn; 1.7, p=0.01). RMS occurred in morning 6a-12p (45.2%) and afternoon 12p-6p (25.8%), whereas NRMS occurred in evening 6p-12a (37.5%) and night 12a-6a (35.3%), p&lt;0.05. NRMS occurred most often in homes (29.1%), bars (18.1%), and the street (42.1%), p&lt;0.05. RMS occurred most often in businesses (51.6%) and schools (16.1%), p&lt;0.05. Children were less often killed in RMS compared with NRMS (1.9% vs 7.0%, p&lt;0.05). RMS deceased were more often police (4.7% vs 0.9%, p&lt;0.05). RMS deceased were most often White (75%) and Hispanic (12.5%) and NRMS deceased were most often Black (56.3%) and White (27.9%), p&lt;0.05. Women more often died in RMS than NRMS (41.9% vs 27%), p=0.01. Perpetrators of RMS were most often White (63.0%) compared to Black (77.3%) in NRMS, p&lt;0.05.

As a result, we are unable to assess post-discharge care, long-term outcomes, and complete episode expenditures. We hypothesized that we could link an established statewide trauma database with insurance claims data to create a longitudinal accounting of these patients and their course after post-acute discharge.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Trauma collaborative quality initiative (CQI) data (2018-2019) from 34 ACS-COT verified Level 1 and Level 2 trauma centers were linked with a state-wide insurance claims database (claims from Medicare and a large commercial payer). Trauma CQI records were linked to insurance records using deterministic matching, requiring records from both sources to match exactly on center, date of birth, and sex, and within one day of encounter dates. We compared CQI-to-claims match rates by insurance type as coded in the CQI registry (Medicare; large commercial payer; other payers not available in the claims database) using a chi-squared test. 
 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 32,707 trauma CQI records identified, 8,591 matched with a claim in the insurance database for an overall match rate of 26.3%. There was a significantly higher CQI-to-claims match rate for CQI records with Medicare or large commercial payer insurance compared to records from other payers not available in the claims database (42.0%, 34.6%, 5.97%; p&lt;0.001 (Table)).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Trauma registry patients can be successfully linked with their respective claims from insurance payers to create a longitudinal picture of their treatment course after discharge from their initial hospitalization. As data from more payers is made available, we expect the match rates to increase, further adding to the strength of this technique.

For hospitalized patients who cannot meet caloric needs with enteral nutrition (EN), parenteral nutrition (PN) is considered. While early initiation of EN is widely accepted, the timing of PN is less clear for certain populations. Current recommendations address the timing of PN, but the application of these recommendations to patients &ge;65 years of age remains unclear. In this retrospective cohort study, we examine the timing of PN in the geriatric trauma and emergency general surgery population. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective cohort study of geriatric patients (&ge;65 years of age) who received PN while admitted to the trauma and acute care surgery services at North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center from 9/10/2012 to 6/6/2021. We defined early PN as initiation on hospital day 4 or earlier, with late PN defined as day 5 or later. We hypothesized that early PN would be associated with a reduced rate of complications, a shorter length of stay, a lower 30-day readmission rate, and a lower 90-day mortality rate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
From the cohort, 9 patients (13%) received early PN, and 60 (87%) received late PN. Other than baseline functional status, demographic statistics were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean age was 73.44 in the early PN group and 78.63 in the late PN group (p=0.49). Patients receiving early PN had a longer hospital length of stay (36.89 vs.35.47 days, p=0.002) but a shorter intensive care unit length of stay (10.78 vs. 19.82 days, p=0.029). There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day readmission rate or 90-day mortality. Patients who received early PN had a lower incidence of pneumonia (0% vs. 30%, p=0.028) without a significantly lower number of days on mechanical ventilation (6.00 vs. 9.28, p=0.11). There was no significant difference in the rate of other complications, such as bloodstream infection, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Early initiation of PN in geriatric patients admitted to trauma or acute care surgery has not demonstrated absolute superiority over late initiation of PN. Since early PN and late PN have different advantages in the outcome measurements of interest, shared decision making with patients or their powers of attorney is encouraged. Additional research with a larger sample size and multiple institutions would further clarify the risks and benefits of early PN.

The pharmacokinetics of antibiotics during resuscitation in bleeding trauma patients are poorly understood. Evidenced-based dosing guidelines are lacking for patients receiving blood products. Hence, we hypothesized that our trauma patients presenting in hemorrhagic shock have a high rate of subsequent infection and that antibiotic dosing varies widely among this cohort of patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients at our urban level one trauma center over the last three years who received greater than two units of blood and antibiotics within the first 6 hours of arrival and survived beyond three days. We recorded patient demographics, presenting hemodynamics, injury specifics, blood products received, timing and type of antibiotics dosed and redosed, indication for antibiotics, infections, and infection type. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
One hundred and sixteen patients met criteria for inclusion. 46% of patients suffered infection during their hospital stay, and 13 patients had more than one infection (PNA = 23, SSI = 18, UTI = 13, bacteremia = 9, abdominal abscess = 5). Increasing incidence of infection was associated with increasing injury severity score, lower initial systolic blood pressure, increasing number of packed red blood cells received within 6 hours, and increasing mortality (p-values &lt; 0.05). 55/116 (47.4%) of patients were redosed with antibiotics within the first 12 hours of arrival, and the timing of this dose varied widely among patients (Figure 1). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Infection rates are high among our trauma population receiving blood transfusion, and antibiotic redosing varies widely. This research provides the groundwork for our prospective trial studying the pharmacokinetics of Cefazolin in bleeding trauma patients.

Kopp<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>New York Presbyterian Queens, Department Of Surgery, Flushing, NEW YORK, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Performance improvement has become a major part in the daily management of the intensive care unit (ICU). Multiple quality metrics have been identified that impact patient care in the ICU and warrant frequent analysis. With the standardization of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the United States, quality control has become easier, but not all EHRs are able to generate reports that meet the needs of the ICU. Developing and maintaining a database involves data collection, data input and data analysis, which can be a time-consuming process. We describe a custom, inexpensive, and efficient method of data collection and analysis that we developed to assess quality measures in our Surgical ICU.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A customized ICU progress note (PN) was created in the EHR (Sunrise Allscripts v18.4), containing all the desired quality metrics to be measured. Using Visual Basics for Applications (VBA) embedded within Microsoft Excel, we created a code that divides the note into specific columns within the database allowing for data analysis. An ICU PN is generated daily for each patient. Each note is then copy and pasted into the Microsoft Excel database. Separate code is written for data analysis. We measured the time necessary for data input per patient using this method compared to manual data entry. Accuracy of the data collected using VBA was assessed by manual verification of abstracted data. We were also able to increase the number of quality or patient-related data points measured from 31 to 41 elements with the capability of adding more as needed by modifying the note.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The development of a customized ICU progress note allowed us to collect specific quality metric data more efficiently. Average time for data input using VBA vs manual entry was 51.9 seconds vs 182 seconds (p&lt;0.05), a 71.4% improvement in efficiency. Data from 14 randomly selected patients was manually verified for accuracy, revealing 76% accuracy rate in automated data abstraction.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Using a standardized ICU PN with a code embedded within Microsoft Excel, we were able to create an ICU quality metrics database. This system allows more efficient data abstraction without significantly compromising accuracy. Furthermore, it allows for more robust data collecting. This can be replicated with any EHR that allows for custom note templates, and the ability to create a VBA script to run in Microsoft Excel. This innovation can be used by hospital systems seeking to monitor and improve ICU quality matrices but lacking advanced built-in data extraction capabilities in their EHR, without significant additional cost or manual labor.

However, no association between ABO blood type and mortality was reported in a recent US-based, single institution study. The objective of this study was to undertake a secondary analysis of the Pragmatic, Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) trial to determine an association with blood type and mortality among severely injured patients receiving massive transfusion in a multicenter US population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The PROPPR trial was an investigation of differential blood product ratios for post-traumatic resuscitation. A Generalized Estimating Equation logistic regression (to account for clustering by study site) adjusted for age, gender, Injury Severity Score, and the Revised Trauma Score was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between in-hospital mortality and blood type.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 680 patients enrolled in the trial, 655 had blood type data; of those, 322 (49.2%) were type O, 213 (32.5%) were type A, and 120 (18.3%) were Type B. Multivariable models suggest that blood type O was not associated with mortality compared to types A and B combined (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51-1.84), type A alone (OR 0.88 95% CI 0.45-1.73), or type B alone (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.55-2.58).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Blood type was not associated with mortality among patients enrolled in this large, multicenter trial of massive transfusion for major bleeding following severe injury.

Cox<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Division Of Trauma & Acute Care Surgery, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Forward military medical treatment facilities lack x-ray imaging capability, limiting providers in their evaluation and treatment of casualties, who occasionally must be evacuated to higher levels of care just for imaging. Ultrasound is the only modality currently available, but has limited applications in treating trauma and extremity injuries. A portable x-ray capability near the point of injury would facilitate care, and some Special Operations teams have even used non-medical x-ray devices such as those designed for assessing explosives in remote environments. There is a need for a portable, compact, durable, battery powered, and easy to use x-ray device to safely produce quality images. US Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) has identified the Smart-C (Turner Imaging Systems, Orem, UT), which is FDA approved, as having the potential to satisfy many of these requirements. This study sought to identify whether the Smart-C could be modified to meet military requirements for advanced imaging in forward environments.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A mixed-methods ethnographic evaluation comprised of demonstration of equipment and observation of use, interviews with military and civilian surgeons, and post-demonstration survey was conducted. The content of the survey was derived from a thematic analysis of the interviews.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The equipment demonstration introduced the device to providers. We subsequently conducted interviews with 10 surgeons, many of whom have experience working in the deployed military setting. The responses were used to design an online survey, which was sent to 20 providers. Analysis of the interviews and survey responses revealed that clinicians identified chest and pelvic imaging as the most important use for a battery powered and portable x-ray device. Other indications included the assessment of extremity injuries and urgent care complaints to limit unnecessary evacuations. The survey showed that the Smart-C could be used by many deployed providers including surgeons, non-surgeon physicians, advanced care providers and medics. The most common location identified for this capability was a role 2 (forward) medical treatment facility, with most respondents rating weight as the most important factor in the design and potential utility of the device, followed by durability and battery life. Limitations of the device include needing a larger size of detector to allow for assessment of chest and pelvic injuries. Potential civilian uses for this device included sports medicine clinics, ICUs, or rural clinics.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study has demonstrated that the Smart-C device has the potential for use in military forward operational environments. It has also generated feedback to the manufacturer to guide the further development of the device, to ensure that it meets the requirements of military medical providers.

Trauma clinical decision support systems (CDSS) improve adherence with evidence-based practice. Unfortunately, a key limitation to the utility of these systems is poor usability and the lack of a user-centered design (UCD). CDSS usability optimization varies in methods deployed and rigor, and rarely combines user and expert-driven methods. The objective of this study was to compare a combined versus single method of identifying usability issues in a rib fracture CDSS care pathway. A critical secondary objective was to conduct a thematic analysis to identify guiding principles for trauma CDSS UCD.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A rib fracture CDSS was previously developed, piloted at an ACS-verified level 1 trauma center, and was planned to scale across 10 level 2-4 verified trauma hospitals. This study was conducted prior to scaling to optimize usability and improve clinician acceptance and adherence.

User-driven usability evaluation: 10 clinicians were selected for simulation-based usability testing using snowball sampling. End-users participated in a novel team based approach (MD/APP + RN) to simulate realistic workflow. Following written informed consent, participants were audio recorded and screen captured performing tasks in the simulated environment using think aloud and open-ended questions.

Expert-driven heuristic evaluation: Two trained (MPH and MS) usability experts conducted a heuristic evaluation of the CDSS using Nielsen&rsquo;s 10 usability heuristics.

Usability issues were identified, catalogued, and ranked on an ordinal scale from cosmetic to catastrophic by each method. 4 severe and 13 mild usability issues were modified prior to scaling. Thematic analysis was utilized to create a supplemental framework for the UCD of trauma CDSS.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
79 usability issues were identified across the two methods of evaluation. 63% of issues were identified by experts and 52% by end-users. Notably, 58% of severe usability issues were identified by expert evaluation alone. Five themes were identified: transparency, functionality and integration into workflow, automated and non-interruptive, flexibility in options, and layout and appearance. Different themes were preferentially identified by different methods (Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
UCD is a critical component of CDSS development and is especially important in trauma patients who benefit from providers adhering to evidence-based guidelines. We propose routine dual-method usability evaluation by experts and end-users during development to optimize UCD. User-centered CDSS should be designed to be transparent, function as intended, integrate into clinician workflow, be maximally automated, flexible to accommodate different institutions and populations, and presented in a clear and simple way.

Martyak<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Eastern Virginia Medical School, Department Of Surgery, Norfolk, VIRGINIA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Shock Trauma Center at University of Maryland, Surgical Critical Care, Baltimore, MARYLAND, USA","Introduction

Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have gained popularity since their introduction as they provide a viable alternative to vitamin K antagonists without needing regular monitoring. There is an increase in elderly patients on NOACs admitted for traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Literature suggests that thromboelastography (TEG) is a reliable technique to measure anticoagulation (AC) status in patients on NOACs. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of TEG in detecting NOAC-related coagulopathy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective chart review of 456 TBI patients on AC admitted at Sentara Norfolk General from 2015-2020 was performed. Inclusion criteria comprised patients on NOACs with a TEG performed at presentation, totaling 71 patients. Analysis of results included TEG values, worsening head CT scan, change in GCS score, and death.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

TEG results showed 0% elevated R time, 1.4% high K time, 1.4% low alpha angle, 4.2% low max amplitude (MA), and 4.2% high LY30 in patients on NOACs. A subset analysis on patients with worsening head CTs revealed 0% high R time, 0% high K time, 0% low alpha angle, 4.8% high MA, and 4.8% high LY30. TEG results were not significantly different between patients who received PCC4 vs those who did not. In patients with worsening head CTs, 42.9% received PCC4, whereas 21.9% did not. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Results of this study suggest TEG does not reliably assess NOAC related coagulopathy. As no TEG showed any expected abnormality caution must be used when using this tool to assess NOAC related coagulopathy or effective reversal. Based on our results utilization of TEG to assess NOAC related coagulopathy must be further investigated.

Additionally, providers are also required to select at least one taxonomy to associate with their NPI that defines their clinical practice (e.g. specialty and relevant sub-specialty). This taxonomy allows payers and agencies to monitor the expertise or level of care rendered. Subsequently, with more research utilizing claims data, the NPI has become an important variable in order to identify a provider&rsquo;s specialty (and sub-specialty) in regards to treatments provided and procedures performed. However, it is unclear if the NPI taxonomy selected is actually an accurate assessment of the provider&rsquo;s true clinical practice or specialization.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data was obtained from the department webpages (Orthopaedic Surgery and General Surgery) at 3 different academic healthcare institutions. The surgeon&rsquo;s specialty (orthopaedic or surgery) as well as any subspecialty (e.g. trauma, adult reconstruction, vascular, transplant, etc.) was recorded. Department members were excluded if they were research only, were not physicians, were oral surgeons or lacked an NPI. The specialty and sub-specialty listed on the website was then compared to the taxonomy(s) listed on the surgeon&rsquo;s NPI record and assessed for agreement and accuracy. A chi-square analysis was performed to evaluate whether specialty or institution affected the agreement.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 295 surgeons (90 orthopaedic &amp; 205 general) at 3 institutions. Of these, 293 (99%) selected a taxonomy consistent with their specialty, however only 188 (63.7%) had a taxonomy that was consistent with their primary subspecialty. Orthopaedic surgeons had a significantly lower rate of subspecialty-taxonomy agreement than general surgeons (51% vs. 69%, p=0.003). The was no difference in the rate of subspecialty-taxonomy agreement across institutions or orthopaedic subspecialties, however there was across general surgery subspecialties (p&lt;0.001). We also identified 6 subspecialties (23 surgeons) without a relevant taxonomy (Table).



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The NPI taxonomy is not very accurate for describing a surgeon&rsquo;s subspecialty or actual practice. Caution should be taken when utilizing this variable to risk adjusting a surgeon&rsquo;s specialization in the analysis of claims data. Further work is needed to discern the reasons behind these inaccuracies and efforts should be considered to educate physicians on the importance of this issue.

This has led to rising interest in various metrics to assess the quality-of-care patients receive, including mortality and readmissions. The increased efficiency of trauma systems has resulted in improved survival of trauma patients. Our goal was to determine if these quality indicators differ based on trauma center designation for older adults.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a retrospective analysis of Medicare inpatient claims (2014-2015) of older adult trauma patients (&gt; 65 years). Quality indicators were mortality and readmission rates at 30 days. Trauma center designation was categorized as Level 1, 2, 3, and Non-trauma centers (NTC). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association of trauma center designation, readmission, and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 754,313 trauma admissions were identified; mean age was 82 years (SD 8.5), 513,934 (68.1%) were female and 690,672 (91.6%) were white. Mean ISS was 9.50 (SD 5.8). 341,546 (45%) patients were treated at a NTC. 30-day mortality was 7.99% and 21,615 (2.87%) were readmitted within 30 days. In unadjusted analysis, level 1 trauma centers had the highest 30-day mortality rate (9.48%, p&lt;0.001) and 30-day readmission rate (2.93%, p=0.453) when compared with other centers. After adjusted analysis, level 2 TCs (odds ratio [OR] 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88 &ndash; 0.94), level 3 TCs (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82 &ndash; 0.89) and NTCs (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.78 &ndash; 0.84) had lower odds of death when compared with level 1 trauma centers. Age, gender, black/other race, ISS, Charlson score, hospital teaching status, hospital size, and hospital region were significantly associated with 30-day mortality. After adjusted analysis, there was no difference in odds of readmission based on trauma center designation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Even though readmission rates did not differ based on trauma center designation, mortality rates were higher in patients treated at level 1 trauma centers, which remained significant after accounting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Further work is needed to explore other quality of care metrics beyond mortality in the trauma population.

It is generally assumed that patients who sustain one type of violent trauma are at risk for sustaining another type. We aim to determine the incidence of and risk factors for recidivism following violent injury. We hypothesize that being the victim of violent injury is a risk factor for subsequent violent trauma.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective, multicenter review of patients who sustained blunt assault or penetrating trauma from January 2013 to December 2019 in Washington, DC. Recidivism was defined as the ratio of readmitted patients among those who survived a previous admission. Univariate associations between each readmission and age, sex, mechanism of injury, AIS, ISS, treatment hospital, and discharge disposition were determined. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to evaluate the incidence of recidivism over time. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the association between characteristics at first admission and time-to-readmission.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The recidivism rate in 13,211 patients was 6.3% (Table 1). 714 patients had 1 re-admission (5.4%), and 122 patients had 2 re-admissions (0.9%). Patients aged 14-30 or 31-45 years had the highest incidences of recidivism (p&lt;0.001). Injury type (blunt vs penetrating) was not associated with readmission, but patients were more likely to be re-injured by the same MOI at a subsequent admission. Risk factors for readmission on multivariate analysis were head AIS &gt;/= 3, male sex, and discharge against medical advice or to jail. Discharge to nursing facility had a negative association with recidivism.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Although it is assumed that once a patient is a victim of violence, they are at risk of falling victim to violent trauma again, incidence of recidivism was found to be relatively low. Despite this, victims of violence aged 14-45 remain an important target population for future violence prevention measures.

Erb<sup>1</sup>, A. Malhotra<sup>1</sup>, G. An<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Vermont College Of Medicine / Fletcher Allen Health Care, Surgery, Burlington, VT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Transfer of trauma patients whose injuries are deemed unsurvivable often result in early death or transition to comfort care and could be considered futile. In rural settings this could have considerable impact on system (e.g. medical transport) and hospital resources, and families (due to travel burden). Identifying features of these patients may provide insight into processes (e.g. telemedicine) to alleviate this impact and help optimize their triage and management.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This is a retrospective study of all interfacility trauma transfers to a single rural Level I trauma center (L1TC) from 2014-2019. Futile transfers were defined as death, hospice, or declaration of comfort measures within 48 hours of transfer without procedural or radiographic intervention at the accepting L1TC. Potentially futile transfers were defined as patients with only confirmatory imaging (no interventional radiologic or operative procedures) at the L1TC, diagnoses with low survivability (e.g. severe cerebral or brainstem injury, severe burns, traumatic aortic rupture), and diagnoses that may favor hospice (e.g. elderly polytrauma). Age, sex, co-morbidities, mechanism of injury, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and physiologic parameters (respiratory rate (RR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) were analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictors of futile transfer.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 3,368 trauma transfers within the 5-year period, 9 (0.27%) met criteria as futile and 28 (0.83%) met criteria as potentially futile. Futile and potentially futile patients were significantly older with falls as the most common mechanism. Futile and potentially futile transfer patients were found to have a significantly higher comorbidity index, lower GCS, higher ISS and serious or greater head and external injuries. Logistic regression found physiologic and injury characteristics, age, GCS, and ISS as significant (p &lt;0.001) predictors of futile trauma transfer (Table 2).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Futile trauma transfers are a small proportion of transfers to a rural L1TC. However, given that rural settings are characterized by sparse populations with baseline access challenges and limited resources in terms of transport and tertiary care beds, even small numbers may have significant impact on resource utilization and logistical-emotional burden on families. Future work would include a larger study to verify and identify further independent predictors of futile transfer, a more granular characterization of the potentially futile cohort, evaluation of systems-level impact (e.g. medical transport network) and assessment of survivor/family perceptions and satisfaction.

Damage control laparotomy is an essential lifesaving maneuver that has become a mainstay in the management of the traumatically injured patient. Massive transfusion protocols are often used to resuscitate patients and support them until the injury can be addressed in the operating room. While these maneuvers are essential, once the patient arrives to the operating room a significant amount of time and resources have been exhausted without gaining significant ground in definintive treatment of the patient. We hypothesize that there is a subsegment of patients who would benefit from hemorrhage control in resuscitation bay. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 


We performed a retrospective analysis of the National Trauma Databank (NTDB) from 2017-2018 for all cases that underwent an exploratory laparotomy after sustaining a traumatic abdominal injury on their first day of admission. Cases were excluded if they did not undergo an exploratory laparotomy on the first day or if they had a major vessel injury, critical injury outside of the abdomen, or if the number of packed red blood cell units was not reported. Major vessels were defined as the aorta, vena cava, and the iliac arteries and veins. Major vessel injuries were excluded as packing alone cannot address the hemorrhage. Variables of interest were age, gender, injury severity score, mortality, time in the emergency department, time to operating room and units of packed red blood cells used. Cases were analyzed for frequency and distribution.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:


A total of 1,923 cases were identified for analysis. 1,334 cases met our exclusion criteria. The population was 77% male with a median age of 32 IQR (23,48), a median systolic blood pressure of 124 IQR (105, 142) in the emergency department, and a median injury severity score of 13 IQR (8,19). The median time in the emergency department was 54 minutes IQR (25,117), the median time to the operating room was 76 IQR (44, 148) , and the median amount of packed red blood cells used were 1000 mL IQR (600, 2100). Overall mortality in ths population was 6%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

In this population, there was a significant amount of time spent prior to arrival in the operating room with a commensurately large blood transfusion requirement. We theorize that emergency department laparotomy with packing prior to moving to the operating room would decrease blood transfusion requirements as well as morbidity and mortality in this select group of patients.

One significant cause of morbidity is lymphedema from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) performed for confirmed node positive disease. High pathological complete response (pCR) rates seen after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) in certain types of breast cancers, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), has encouraged a shift away from ALND in favor of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), a procedure often combined with targeted axillary dissection (TAD). Our objective was to determine if cN1 TNBC patients with a complete clinical response (cCR) to NAST demonstrate a significant OS difference when treated with SLNB in comparison to ALND.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective analysis on female adult patients in the American College of Surgeons&rsquo; National Cancer Database (NCDB) with non-metastatic cT1-cT4, cN1, unilateral TNBC with a cCR to NAST between 2012 and 2017. Patients were divided into SLNB and ALND groups which were propensity score matched to compare OS using a Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis. A Cox univariable and multivariable regression analysis was used to identify significant OS predictors.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 2,953 adult females met selection criteria. 1,062 (36.0%) patients underwent SLNB and 1,891 (64.0%) patients underwent ALND.

Patients were subdivided into ypN0 and ypN+ groups and, again, propensity-matched. In the ypN0 subgroup, 884 patient pairs were matched and no significant OS difference was found in SLNB vs. ALND (85.29 vs. 82.60 months, p=0.638). In the ypN+ subgroup, 129 patient pairs were matched and a downward trend in OS was found in the SLNB patients in comparison to the ALND patients (64.37 vs. 72.45, p=0.085). Cox univariable and multivariable regression analysis identified increasing age, medial tumors, advanced T stage, partial or no in-breast response, and pathological nodal status as unfavorable predictors of OS.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: SLNB and ALND have comparable OS outcomes in TNBC cN1 patients who show a cCR to NAST with ypN0 status, but SLNB may have worse OS outcomes in comparison to ALND in patients with ypN+ status. Until results from ongoing clinical trials are available, residual nodal disease in SLNB should prompt further adjuvant therapy.

Inherent with surveys, poor response rates remain a challenge in evaluating short- and long-term PROs. Some studies suggest that direct engagement with survey participants may improve overall response rates. In this sub-study of a longitudinal, randomized controlled trial, we sought to evaluate the effect of patient engagement and results feedback on longitudinal survey completion, which was not a primary or secondary outcome of the initial clinical trial objectives. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Newly diagnosed stage 0-III breast cancer patients seen at an academic breast center between June 2019 and July 2021 were invited to participate in a longitudinal PRO study. Patients willing to participate were emailed the BREAST-Q preoperative module, a validated PRO tool evaluating four QoL domains: satisfaction with breasts, psychosocial well-being, physical well-being, and sexual well-being. The patients also received the BREAST-Q postoperative module gauging the same four domains at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after surgery. Upon enrollment in the study, patients were randomized into the intervention arm &ndash; who received survey results upon completion - or the control group &ndash; who received no feedback. The primary endpoint for this sub-study was completion rate for each survey offered.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 204 patients offered the preoperative PRO module, 92 were in the intervention group and 112 were in the control group. The baseline preoperative survey completion rate was 65.2% for the intervention group and 63.4% for the control group. Longitudinal rates of completion for the postoperative PRO surveys among patients who had completed the pre-operative survey are shown in Figure 1. A Poisson regression was used to compare overall rates of completion between the two study arms, and there was no difference between the two arms at alpha = 0.05 (IRR 1.23 [95% CI 0.99-1.52]).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this prospective, randomized-controlled study, patients who had undergone breast surgery and were able to see their PRO results over time demonstrated similar completion rates for subsequent PRO surveys compared to their counterparts who did not receive their results. However, these early data are inconclusive given the relatively small sample size, and the trends demonstrated in Figure 1 are promising. More longitudinal survey completion data will need to be accrued in order to conclusively determine the effect of this intervention on PRO survey response rate.

Women &ge;70 years old with early-stage, hormone-receptor positive, clinically node-negative breast cancer are eligible for omission of two previously routine breast cancer therapies: axillary staging with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and adjuvant radiotherapy. However, two-thirds of these women continue to receive at least one of the low-value services. One hypothesis is the lack of decision support tools for this population. In response, we adapted a breast cancer decision aid to help older women identify treatment preferences and consider omission of SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We enrolled women &ge;70 years old without a history of breast cancer of various educational, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. We adapted a previously published breast cancer decision aid to a format acceptable to older patients through &ldquo;think aloud&rdquo; interviews in which participants verbalized their thoughts while reading the decision aid. Transcripts were thematically analyzed, and the aid was iteratively revised. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Participants (n=10) expressed competing preferences and values influencing their perception of the decision aid in five ways. First, they were surprised to discover age-based distinctions in care. While most recognized altered priorities and responded positively to age-specific recommendations, some were concerned age cut-offs may be arbitrary and fail to account for increasing longevity. Second, preferences for patient autonomy differed, ranging from wholly patient-directed to clinician-directed decision-making models. When learning they had treatment choices, women who preferred clinician-directed decisions voiced frustration or anxiety, whereas women who preferred autonomy appreciated the recognition that patient values differ. Third, some participants distrusted medical providers and doubted that they would respect patient wishes. Fourth, almost all participants wanted more, rather than less, information and explanation of concepts. Lastly, many desired more empathetic language and tone. Most participants preferred a paper format to annotate before reviewing it with their physician.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Adapting a breast cancer decision aid for older women required consideration of patient perception of age-specific recommendations, preference for autonomy, distrust of medical providers, desire for detailed information, and need for empathetic language and tone. These factors should be considered when approaching shared decision-making with older women with breast cancer.

Bradycardia and hypotension progressing to asystole and shock are rare but morbid consequences of an extreme vagal reaction. The vasovagal response has been well-documented during abdominal laparoscopic insufflation, with the mechanism thought to be increased vagal tone caused by peritoneal stretch. Pre-operative beta blockade increases this risk. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have also been described during breast surgery in the setting of breast augmentation and during retraction for reduction mammoplasty. The hypothesized mechanism is chest wall stretch, however this is incompletely understood. We speculate that stretch from hematoma following breast surgery may similarly trigger an autonomic response, resulting in hypotension disproportionate to the degree of blood loss. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a single-institution retrospective review of patients returned to the operating room for hematoma evacuation following partial mastectomy or mastectomy without reconstruction from 2011 to 2021.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Sixteen patients with a median age of 58 (range: 46-76) returned to the operating room for bleeding following partial mastectomy or mastectomy without reconstruction. The average hematoma size was 353mLs (range: 50-1000mLs). The average minimum heart rate was 67 (range: 47-82) and the average maximum heart rate was 89 (range: 67-147). The average blood pressure nadir was 95/46 (range: 147-41/71-30). 56% of patients recorded a MAP &lt; 60 at some point in the peri-operative period. 19% of patients were taking pre-operative beta blockers. 44% of patients displayed lightheadedness, dizziness, and somnolence, and 38% displayed syncope or near-syncope. 6% of patients complained of chest pain, and 38% of patients complained of breast and shoulder pain. No patients received atropine or other vagolytic medications; rather, the anesthesia team managed the intraoperative hypotension by administering fluids and vasopressors.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Hematoma following breast surgery may result in hypotension disproportionate to the volume of blood loss. While not all patients exhibit this physiology, the hypotension may be profound and inappropriately treated if vagovagal response is not considered. Patients with larger hematomas (500-600mLs) and outpatient beta blockade are more likely to exhibit symptoms. Given none of the patients in this series lost over 1500cc of blood, symptoms should reflect Class I or II shock (normotensive with possible tachycardia). The hypotension without compensatory tachycardia observed in some of these patients is more consistent with a vagal response due to chest wall stretch rather than hypovolemic shock. Due to the dearth of information surrounding this topic, the potential risk of an overwhelming parasympathetic response progressing to asystole, and the risk of fluid overload or unnecessary transfusions, this clinical finding warrants further research and education.

The management of patients with axillary lymph node-positive breast cancer has evolved significantly in the last few decades. Multiple trials have evaluated the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The ACOSOG Z1071 trial reported a 12.6% false-negative rate with SLNB among patients who converted to clinically N0 disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A subset analysis of this trial demonstrated that clip placement at diagnosis of node-positive disease with the removal of the clipped node during SLNB reduces the FNR of SLNB to 6.8% after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, different methods have been evaluated to optimize the identification and excision of the biopsy positive clipped axillary lymph node at the time of SLNB, which can be challenging due to interval normalization of the clipped node. This study examines the factors that might contribute in identifying the clipped nodes and facilitating surgical excision.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All breast cancer patients with biopsy-proven metastatic axillary lymph nodes who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection between 2018 and 2020 at a single institution were identified. A retrospective chart review was performed, and demographic, preoperative, and intraoperative variables were compared between localization and non-localization groups using Fisher&#39;s exact and McNemar&rsquo;s tests. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Ninety-eight patients who met inclusion criteria were identified. Age ranged from 25-84 years with a mean age was 51.5 + 12.2 years. Of the 53 patients with putative ultrasound-detectable clips, 26 (49%) were localized. Of the 40 patients with abnormal post-neoadjuvant therapy nodes on imaging, 25 (62.5%) were localized. Abnormal preoperative imaging was significantly associated with localization (odds ratio 1.26, 95% CI 0.61-2.68, P = 0.004). However, putative ultrasound-detectable clips and node status on final pathology were not significantly associated with localization. Twirl-shaped clips were significantly associated with localization, with 14 of 28 localized (OR 2.142, 95% CI 1.14-4.50, P &lt; 0.016). The confidence interval associating ultrasound visible clip brands and node-positive disease with localization skewed towards a positive correlation, although P &gt; 0.05.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The study suggests that lymph nodes with abnormal imaging after neoadjuvant therapy are more likely to be localized, while nodes that completely normalize remain difficult to localize. With better neoadjuvant therapy, localizing lymph nodes for axillary staging continues to be a challenge. Better technology for localization is needed to be able to localize clips after prolonged neoadjuvant therapy.

Chamberlain<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>HCA Healthcare/USF Morsani College of Medicine GME: Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point, Department Of Surgery, Hudson, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Microinvasive breast cancer, also commonly known as ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCISM), is a distinct clinical entity from DCIS and invasive breast carcinoma. Multiple small retrospective studies and a few larger analyses have attempted to elucidate the incidence and risk factors associated with axillary involvement in DCISM. This systematic review analyzes the largest sample size to date on the topic and provides clarity on the need for axillary staging. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A comprehensive PUBMED and Google Scholar search was conducted utilizing the keywords microinvasive breast cancer, DCISM, axillary staging, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). 28 studies involving 3,484 DCISM patients were identified for analysis. Primary endpoints were a positive SLNB and secondary endpoints were an analysis of possible risk factors for axillary involvement and the incidence of micrometastases, macrometastases, and isolated tumor cells. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

3,484 DCISM patients underwent axillary evaluation. 327 (9.4%, 95% CI [.07-.12]) patients had a positive axillary finding of cancer. Amongst studies reporting subgroups, 97 patients (3.3%, 95% CI [.02-.05]) had axillary macrometastases, whereas micrometastases and isolated tumor cells were noted in 125 (4.8%, 95% CI [.04-.06]) and 85 (3.3%, 95% CI [.02-.05]) respectively. Further examination of the literature demonstrates that large volume DCIS, comedoform necrosis, women &lt;50 years of age, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion are significant risk factors associated with axillary involvement

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

DCISM is a more aggressive entity than DCIS with higher axillary involvement (9.4% v 1-2%). Findings of limited axillary LN involvement in the setting of DCISM may have therapeutic implications guiding the selection of additional surgery, radiation fields, as well as the use of adjuvant hormonal and/or systemic therapy. The likelihood of axillary involvement can be partially predicted based upon patient specific and histologic specific features, but not in all cases. We recommend a low threshold to perform a SLNB in DCISM preceded by presentation at a multidisciplinary tumor board.

Surgical resection is the gold standard for early stage breast cancer. Incomplete resection (positive surgical margins) are associated with increased risk of recurrence and inferior survival. Endocrine therapy is recommended as the essential systemic treatment for hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer after surgery. We assessed the impact of adjuvant treatment for stage 1 HR+/HER2- breast cancer with microscopic residual disease. We hypothesized that chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy would not be associated with improved survival relative to endocrine therapy alone. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Cancer Database was queried for pathologic stage I HR+HER2- breast cancer patients treated with partial mastectomy and adjuvant whole-breast irradiation between 2004-2017. The prevalence, predictors, impact and adjuvant treatment approaches to positive surgical margins were investigated. Overall survival was compared between systemic treatment groups using multivariable cox proportional hazards regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among the 230,983 pathological stage 1 HR+HER2- breast cancer patients, a positive surgical margin was identified in 6,091 (2.6% of resections) patients, including 3,561 with microscopically positive (R1) margins (1.5%), 88 with macroscopically positive (R2) margins (0.04%) and 2,442 (1.1%) with residual disease not otherwise specified. Compared with complete resections, patients with positive margin (Haz. Ratio=1.379, P&lt;0.001) including R1 resections (Haz. Ratio=1.299, P=0.003) was associated with inferior overall survival. Among the R1 patients, 78.7% received endocrine therapy only, 11.7% received both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, 1.2% received chemotherapy only and 8.5% received no systemic therapy. After controlling for patient, facility and tumor characteristics, endocrine therapy alone provided greatest superior survival benefit to no systemic therapy (Haz. Ratio = 0.378, p&lt;0.001) followed by combination chemotherapy and endocrine therapy (Haz. Ratio = 0.446, p=0.020). Compared with endocrine therapy alone, addition of chemotherapy is not associated with additional overall survival benefit ( Haz. Ratio=1.179, P=0.595, Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The administration of chemotherapy in addition to hormone therapy is not associated with an improved survival in early stage HR+HER2- breast cancer with microscopic residual disease undergoing endocrine therapy alone. Further study is warranted to clarify the role of chemotherapy in this population as this retrospective study does not suggest a benefit.

Axillary management for breast cancer has advanced significantly over the years, with significant de-escalation of axillary surgery. However, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) remains an important procedure in selected cases. Given the procedure&#39;s complexity and associated morbidity, we developed a referral program for ALND to utilize the experience and special services available at our center, most notably immediate lymphatic reconstruction. We are reporting the preliminary findings of a novel Axillary Surgery Referral Program.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The Axillary Surgery Referral Program was established in 2017 in close collaboration between the section of breast surgical oncology and the division of plastic surgery. Patients with breast cancer and indications for ALND are referred to the program for assessment and potential surgical intervention. We conducted a retrospective review of cases referred for axillary dissection. We report on the referral characteristics and operational processes of the program.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 83 patients have been referred to the program since 2017. Most cases (~95%) are referrals from outside the state. The annual number of cases has increased throughout the program&rsquo;s duration. Patient care coordination is facilitated by breast cancer nurse navigators. The indications for referrals (Table 1) are positive sentinel lymph nodes in patients not meeting ACOSOG Z0011 criteria, residual nodal disease following completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, locally advanced disease, and shared-decision between patient-physician for not pursuing a targeted axillary dissection. Patients traveling from beyond the state have post-op care managed with a combination of telehealth, local surgeon care, and return visits as needed. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The Axillary Surgery Referral Program has expanded since inception, with the majority of patients referred for management of positive SLNB and not meeting criteria for ACOSOG Z0011. Our program provides an opportunity for a greater number of patients to benefit from our unique services available for axillary surgery, while providing an excellent learning opportunity for residents and trainees on a procedure that is becoming less common. In the future, we intend to assess patient and provider satisfaction with the referral process, as well as prospectively track long term patient outcomes.

However, its role in the microbiome remains controversial. The gut microbiome has shown to play an important role in immunology and cancer. Further, recent data has suggested a relationship between the gut microbiome and breast cancer (BC). These studies have shown that the gut flora of patients with BC differs from that of healthy patients. Research regarding enterococcal infections and its sequela is limited and further research is needed in order to understand the relationship between infection and cancer. Enterococci may prevent the development of BC through complex immunologic and microbiotic adaptations following an enterococcal infection. This study investigated the effect of enterococcus infection and the incidence of BC.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective study (2010-2020) was provided by a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant national database and conducted using a Humans Health Insurance Database. International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> codes, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), and National Drug Codes were used to identify BC diagnosis and enterococcus infection. Patients were matched for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), antibiotic treatment, and region of residence. Chi-squared, logistic regression, and odds ratio were implemented to assess significance and estimate relative risk.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Enterococcus infection was associated with a decreased incidence of BC. 671 out of 28,518 (2.35%) patients with a prior enterococcus infection and 1,459 out of 28,518 (5.12%) patients without enterococcus infection subsequently developed BC. The difference was statistically significant (p&lt;2.2x10-16). Logistic regression also indicated enterococcus infection was associated with a decreased incidence of BC (RR=0.60, 95% CI [0.57, 0.63]). Treatment for enterococcus infection was analyzed and controlled for in both enterococcus infected and noninfected populations. 398 out of 11,523 (3.34%) patients with a prior enterococcus infection and treated with antibiotics were compared to 624 out of 11,523 (5.41%) patients with no history of enterococcus infection (control) and received alike antibiotic treatment. Both populations subsequently developed BC. Results remained statistically significant (p&lt;2.2x10-16) with a relative risk of 0.57 (95% CI [0.54, 0.60]).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study shows a statistically significant correlation between enterococcus infection and a decreased incidence of BC. Further exploration is needed to identify and understand not only the role of enterococcus in the microbiome, but also the protective mechanism(s) and impact enterococcus infection may have on BC development. Ultimately, further research is needed in order to understand the complex and intricate relationship between the microbiome, immunology, bacterial infections, and carcinogenesis.

Breast cancer metastasis to the ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes (ISCN) was considered stage IV disease until AJCC 6<sup>th</sup> edition in 2003. Currently, ISCN is classified as advanced locoregional disease (N3c or stage IIIC). With improved imaging, positive ISCNs are increasingly detected at presentation in locally advanced breast cancers. Surgical management of the supraclavicular (SC) nodal basin remains controversial. We sought to identify and describe breast cancer patients at our institution presenting with ISCN disease, response to therapies, surgical management, adjuvant treatment and outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single institution retrospective chart review was conducted on patients presenting with clinical T1-T4N3cM0 breast cancer between September 1998 and January 2021. Patients were screened for imaging or biopsy proven ISCN disease. Data was analyzed with descriptive statistics for demographic and disease characteristics. Kaplan-Meier estimates and curves were generated and log-rank tests were used to compare locoregional recurrence between patient who underwent surgical resection of ISCN +/- radiation or radiation therapy alone. Chi-square tests, Fisher&rsquo;s exact test, Kruskal-Wallis tests were used on the demographic and clinical variables.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Our initial database query resulted in 257 patients with clinical and pathological N3c disease After excluding patients with concomitant distant metastases, 18 (7%) patients with imaging or biopsy proven isolated ISCN disease were included for chart review. The median age was 56.4 (range: 33-75). Median primary tumor size was 3.9cm (range: 0-8.5cm). Most patients were white (n=14, 78%), Hispanic (n=3, 17%), and black (n=1, 5%). Nine (50%) patients were estrogen receptor positive, 7 (39%) were progesterone receptor positive, and 5 (28%) were HER2 positive. Sixteen (89%) patients were given neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Almost all patients (94%) underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Four (22%) patients underwent targeted supraclavicular lymph node (SCN) excisional biopsy using radar reflector localization, 3 (17%) had ipsilateral supraclavicular nodal dissection (ISCND) and 11 (61%) did not undergo SCN surgery. In patients having SCN resection (targeted dissection or ISCND), 71% had NAC (n=5). Residual SCN disease was identified in 2 patients (40%). All patients underwent radiation to include the ISCN fossa. Local and distant recurrence rate of patients who underwent SCN resection was 57.1% and recurrence free survival (RFS) at 24 months was 80%. The RFS at 24 months for those treated with radiation only was 78%. There was no difference in recurrence rate between targeted ISCN excisional biopsy and ISCND (57.1% vs 54.5%, p &gt; 0.99).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
For breast cancer patients with ISCN metastasis, ISCN resection did not affect recurrence rate or recurrence free survival. Surgical management of the SCN offers no benefit over radiotherapy alone on short term follow up.

The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of abnormal mammograms and breast cancer mortality in Mexico.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively analyzed Mexican data sets from 2013 to 2019 (except 2018). Records without report or classified as BI-RADS 6 were excluded. Prevalence of abnormal mammography (BI-RADS 0, 3, 4, or 5), and prevalence of biopsy recommendation (BI-RADS 4 or 5) were calculated. Females were classified according to age groups (&lt;40 years, 40 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, and &ge;60 years) and compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. States were classified into quartiles according to the gross domestic product per capita (GDP). Crude mortality rate is reported per 100,000 females.

Abnormal mammograms were identified in a of 10.9% of cases. Females younger than 40 years old had higher rates (26%) when compared to the other groups (p&lt;0.01, Figure 1.A). Similarly, recommendation for biopsy was identified in 0.7% of all cases and the rates were higher in those females younger than 40 years old (p&lt;0.01, Figure 1.B). Crude mortality rate increased from 16.7 deaths per 100,000 females in 2013 to 18.9 deaths per 100,000 females in 2017, and those females older than 60 years had the highest mortality number (p&lt;0.01, Figure 1.C). The States with the highest mortality rate were those classified as High and Middle-Upper by GDP, particularly those in the North and Center of Mexico.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Breast cancer mortality in Mexico is rising, particularly in those females older than 60 years. We think that females younger than 40 years had higher rates of abnormal mammogram and biopsy recommendation because this group probably represents a high-risk group. A National policy to increase mammograms performance in combination with complementary studies are needed with the intention to decrease cancer mortality.

The purpose of this study was to compare survival after SLND to ALND in men with clinical T1 or T2 invasive primary breast and positive sentinel lymph nodes. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adult men with clinical T1 or T2 invasive primary breast cancer, clinically negative lymph nodes at presentation, and 1-2 positive sentinel nodes, who underwent mastectomy from 2010 to 2015 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base. SLND was defined as &le;6 lymph nodes removed and ALND was defined as &ge;10 lymph nodes removed, based on prior published definitions. Patients who had an unknown type of axillary surgery or 7-9 lymph nodes removed were excluded. Propensity scores were created for the odds of undergoing ALND, based on age, clinical stage, tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, hormone receptor status, receipt of radiation, chemotherapy, and/or hormone therapy. Patients were matched 1:1 based on propensity score. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Subset analysis was performed in patients who underwent radiation. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In total, 609 patients were identified; 44.5% (n=271) of patients underwent ALND. Unadjusted, ALND was associated with treatment at an academic center (36.9% vs. 24.3%; p=0.0030), estrogen receptor positive disease (99.3% vs. 96.5%; p=0.0133), and HER2-positive breast cancer (12.2% vs. 7.4%; p=0.0458) when compared to patients who underwent SLND only. Unadjusted, median survival was similar for patients who underwent ALND and SLND (5-year survival: 78.7% vs. 71.4%; p=0.0889). However, after matching there was a trend towards superior survival for patients who underwent ALND compared to SLND (5-year survival; 78.2% vs. 68.7%; p=0.0681). On subset analysis in patients who underwent radiation, ALND was associated with significant survival benefit compared to SLND alone after matching (5-years survival: 88.9% vs. 66.9%; p=0.0239).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: The results of this study suggest a trend towards improved survival for male breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes who underwent ALND compared to SLND, especially in patients who underwent radiation. Further studies are necessary validating these findings in a larger cohorts with longer survival follow-up.

James<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Breast Surgical Oncology, Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Patients with breast cancer face a wide range of health-related quality-of-life issues. Integrating patient-reported outcomes (PRO) data into patient assessment can improve care quality. With this in mind, we created a breast surgery outcomes database that includes PRO data as a novel approach to informing strategies to improve patient experience in breast cancer surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We created the Breast Cancer Surgery Quality Improvement (BCSQI) database using a customized REDCap system. All patients who have their initial breast cancer surgery performed at the BIDMC BreastCare Center<sup>TM</sup> are entered into the database. The system software automatically sends a survey (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Breast; FACT-B) to each postsurgical patient at 3 months, evaluating elements of health-related quality of life. Domains include physical, social, emotional and functional well-being.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Currently, 151 of the 817 patients in the database have responded to the survey after three months (~20% response rate). Patients reported high levels of satisfaction with their physical well-being (PWB; 89.6%), social well-being (SWB; 86.5%), emotional well-being (EWB; 64.7%), and functional well-being (FWB; 73.8%). Patients reported positive experiences regarding breast cancer-specific quality-of-life symptoms (BCS; 67.9%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We developed a novel quality database that assesses patient-reported outcomes following breast cancer surgery. Our preliminary data indicate that PROs for most domains are high 3 months after surgery; however, emotional well-being and breast-specific quality of life symptoms are the lowest rated domains. These data help to inform post-surgery expectations and can direct efforts to provide additional patient support.

Furthermore, the bacterial profile in healthy and cancerous breast tissue differs with a higher relative abundance of bacteria capable of causing DNA damage in breast cancer patients. Previous bacterial infections may change the composition of the microbiome and partially account for the environmental factors promoting breast cancer. One study found that higher amounts of Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Enterobacteriaceae, of which Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a part of, was present in breast tumor tissue. Based on E. coli&rsquo;s ability to damage DNA, it is hypothesized that there is an increased risk of breast cancer associated with previous E. coli infection. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between E. coli infection and the incidence of breast cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Holy Cross Health, Fort Lauderdale provided access to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) compliant national database for the purpose of academic research. International Classification of Disease 9th and 10th Codes (ICD-9, ICD-10) were used to conduct a retrospective analysis using data from January 2010 to December 2019. All breast cancer diagnoses and all patients infected versus not infected with E. coli that underwent typical E. coli treatment were investigated. The obtained data was matched for age, Charlson Comorbidity Score (CCI score), and antibiotic treatment. Standard statistical methods were applied to determine statistical significance and odds ratio was used to estimate the relative risk. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The incidence of breast cancer was 2.51% and present in 2043 patients in the E. coli group compared to 5.996% and present in 4874 patients in the control group. The incidence of breast cancer was 3.84% and present in 1223 patients in the treated E. coli group compared to 6.38% and present in 2034 patients in the treated control group. The decreased incidence of breast cancer in the E. coli and treated E. coli groups was statistically significant with a p-value of 2.2x10-16 and 2.264x10-16, respectively. The odds ratio in the E. coli and treated E. coli groups was 0.784 and 0.787 with a 95% confidence interval, respectively (0.756-0.813; 0.743-0.833). The current study shows a statistically significant decrease in breast cancer incidence in association with previous Escherichia coli infection.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Researching the relationship between single bacterial species is important as only up to 10% of breast cancer risk is attributable to genetics, while the contribution of environmental factors including previous infections potentially accounts for a majority of preventable risk. Further evaluation is recommended to assess the potential and mechanism of E. coli in decreasing the risk of breast cancer.

In the acute trauma setting, the effect of BMI on trauma patients with mild TBI (GCS 13-15) has not been fully investigated. This study evaluated the potential effects of extreme BMI on outcomes in trauma patients with mild TBI.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective chart review was done for adult trauma patients requiring ICU admission at our center from 2013 to 2019. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were compared according to BMI during their index hospitalization. Multivariate logistic regression and Fishers exact test were utilized to identify clinical outcomes and mortality in these cohorts. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1448 trauma patients were identified during the period of interest. During their ICU admission, obese patients were more likely to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR=5.39, p&lt;0.03), cardiac arrhythmias (OR=4.24, p&lt;0.03) and pressure ulcers (OR=4.57, p&lt;0.02). Underweight patients were more likely to have venous embolic events (OR=7.40, p&lt;0.05). For patients with more than 2 days of ICU stay (n=553), compared with normal BMI patients, obese and underweight patient had a higher mortality (Obese: OR=2.14, p&lt;0.05, underweight OR=3.49, p&lt;0.05). Obese patients were also more likely to have preexisting comorbidities: diabetes (34.7% vs 13.5%, p&lt;0.001), hypertension (53.4% vs 29.5%, p&lt;0.001).

When working with other providers, physicians may uncover errors from a different healthcare system that have affected their patients. This survey study aimed to expand on the previous findings about intersystem medical error discovery (IMED) by describing cancer specialists&rsquo; perspectives on IMED disclosure to patients and feedback to the responsible provider. Given the limited institutional and professional guidelines on IMED, we anticipated that full disclosure to patients and feedback to responsible providers would be limited by challenges such as increased uncertainty about the error and personal discomfort with providing feedback.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted an online and paper-based survey from July 2020 &ndash; January 2021 with cancer specialist physicians from a single National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Center. An email invitation was sent to a random sample of 100 specialists. Participants were surveyed regarding their values, thresholds, and barriers to disclosing IMED to patients and providing feedback to the responsible provider. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
39 physicians began the survey, with varied response rates to survey questions. Most physicians believed that it was necessary to disclose medical errors that occurred at a different health system (72%) and that there can be a standard to disclose medical errors, despite situational context (60%). Regarding patient disclosure, physicians reported they are more likely to disclose to the patient with increasing severity of harm of the error from minor (69%) to severe (94%). They were still likely to disclose even with uncertainty, specifically about whether an error had occurred (66%) or the source of the error (59%). Concerning feedback to the responsible provider, more than half of participants agreed that it is important to communicate with the responsible provider about IMED (90%), and most agreed it is fair to do so (90%), especially if a similar error has been made in the past (97%). Physicians said they are more likely to give feedback if they have a pre-existing relationship with the responsible provider (97%) or if there is a potential for a lawsuit (90%). Challenges to feedback included an unclear source of error and limited time for feedback.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
IMED disclosures to patients and feedback to responsible providers are more likely to occur when there is increased certainty about the error and tangible consequences to patients. Having a standardized framework or societal guidance as well as building intersystem relationships may facilitate IMED disclosure and feedback. Setting the precedent for IMED disclosure will require intersystem coordination and institutional buy-in.

Stitzenberg<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill, Surgery, Chapel Hill, NC, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Composite area socioeconomic status (aSES) measures are increasingly utilized in health services research. Worse aSES is consistently associated with poorer short- and long-term outcomes across the cancer care continuum. However, there are multiple published measures of aSES, and there is little evidence on the comparative performance of these measures. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the comparative model performance of four commonly used aSES measures on two outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer: 1) guideline concordant care and 2) overall survival. We hypothesized adding aSES measures would improve overall model ability to predict guideline concordant care and overall survival compared to models with standard clinical and demographic data alone.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We included patients with colorectal cancer from 2006-2015 from the North Carolina State Cancer Registry matched with Medicare, Medicaid, and Private insurance claims. The primary outcomes were 1) guideline concordant care (defined broadly using National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines), and 2) overall survival. The primary aSES study variables were the Social Deprivation Index (SDI), Distressed Communities Index (DCI), Area Deprivation Index (ADI), and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). We used multivariable logistic modeling and Cox proportional hazards modeling to assess the adjusted association of each indicator, in separate models, with guideline concordant care and overall survival, respectively. We compared model performance for each SES indicator model with the base model that includes only standard sociodemographic and clinical data (age, sex, race, cancer stage, Charlson comorbidity index, insurance, and marital status) using likelihood ratio testing, and area under the curve assessments to compare SES indicator models with each other.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

We included 9,457 patients with colorectal cancer. We found that the ADI, SVI and SDI, but not DCI, were significantly associated with receiving guideline concordant care and significantly improved model fit over the base model on likelihood ratio testing. AUC analysis showed that all models had similar AUCs (Table). With respect to overall survival, we found that all indices were independently and significantly associated with survival, and significantly improved model fit over the base model on likelihood ratio testing. AUC analysis again showed all aSES measures had comparable performance for overall survival at 5 years.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

This analysis demonstrates that most aSES measures improved model fit over clinical and individual sociodemographic measures with respect to guideline concordant care and overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer. This demonstrates the importance of including these measures in risk adjustment models. However, of the commonly available measures, no one measure stood out as superior to others.

The present study aimed to define the incidence of VTE following major intraabdominal or intrathoracic cancer resection in a contemporary cohort and to evaluate its association with in-hospital mortality, costs and 30-day readmissions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adults undergoing elective gastrectomy, colectomy, pulmonary lobectomy, pancreatectomy or esophagectomy for malignancy were identified in the 2016-2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database using International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision codes. Operative approach was categorized as open or minimally invasive. Definition of VTE encompassed deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Multivariable linear and logistic models were developed to evaluate associations between VTE and post-operative outcomes. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, with secondary outcomes of length of stay (LOS), costs and 30-day non-elective readmission. Risk-adjusted outcomes are reported as estimates (rate per 100) or beta coefficients.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of an estimated 167,483 patients, 1.2% developed VTE. Rates of VTE were highest for esophagectomy (3.3%) and gastrectomy (2.5%), and lowest for lobectomy (0.8%). Patients with VTE were older (70 years vs 68 years, p&lt;0.001), more frequently male (56.8% vs 49.0%, p&lt;0.001) and had a greater comorbidity burden as defined by the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (6 vs 3, p&lt;0.001). VTE was more common with open operations compared to minimally invasive (1.7% vs 0.7%, p&lt;0.001). After adjustment, VTE was associated with significantly increased risk of mortality across all resection types (Figure). VTE conferred the greatest risk-adjusted increase in mortality for lobectomy (11.8% vs 1.0%, p&lt;0.001) followed by esophagectomy (14.0% vs 3.8%, p=0.01) and pancreatectomy (12.0% vs 1.9%, p&lt;0.001). Across all operations, VTE was associated with greater risk-adjusted hospitalization duration by 10.1 days (95% CI: 9.1-11.1) and index hospitalization costs by $40,900 (95% CI: $36,000-$45,800). Compared to patients without VTE, the adjusted rate of readmission for those with VTE was greater for both colectomy (15.8% vs 8.9%, p&lt;0.001) and lobectomy (14.5% vs 7.8%, p=0.003).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: VTE is strongly associated with poor outcomes and greater resource use following major abdominal and thoracic surgery for malignancy. This study quantifies the clinical and cost burden of VTE in a contemporary cohort, identifying the continued need for strategies to prevent and optimize management of VTE in patients undergoing cancer resections.

Early identification of life-threatening injuries and appropriate trauma triaging is associated with reducing mortality and morbidity. The literature supports using lactate as an indicator for OR team activation on hospital arrival, however, there may be other predictors pre-hospital. We sought to identify whether trauma activation pages accurately predict OR activation and which additional physiologic factors exist to improve paging and OR activation accuracy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted a 10-year retrospective review of the regional trauma database at Erie County Medical Center, a Level I trauma center, for penetrating thoracoabdominal gunshot wounds from 2009-2019. All trauma page 1 patients were identified and stratified into direct OR, CT to OR and survived vs. expired groups for direct OR. We excluded all dead-on arrival and walk in patients. Outcomes and patient characteristics were compared univariately using paired T tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

217 Trauma level 1 patients (116 direct OR and 101 CT to OR) were identified. Direct trauma patients had a higher ISS (23.23 vs. 17.33 p&lt;.001), lower SBP (98.79 vs. 131.2 mmHg p&lt;.0001), and DBP (63.44 vs. 81.48mmHg p&lt;.0001) blood pressures when compared to the CT group. Their GCS was also significantly lower in direct patients (10.54 vs. 13.88 p&lt;.0001). Direct to OR patients were more acidotic as indicated by pH (7.24 vs. 7.33 p&lt;.0001), ED CO2 (19.43 vs. 21.34 p&lt;.001) and anion gap (17.4 vs. 12.15 p&lt;.0001). INR for direct was higher than CT to OR (1.63 vs. 1.13 p&lt;.05), indicating higher rates of coagulopathy. The mortality rate for Direct to OR is 38.79% compared to the CT group at 5.94%. 45 of the 116 direct OR patients died, yielding mortality rate of 38.8%.

Chest patients who died (n-28) had lower SBP (83.91 vs. 98.79 mmHg p&lt;.05), lower DBP (28.28 vs. 57.4 mmHg p&lt;.001), lower GCS (5.82 vs. 12.26 p&lt;.0001) and lower heart rates at 83.91bpm vs. 115.65bpm p&lt;.05). They were more acidotic (pH 7.04 vs. 7.21 p&lt;.001) and more severely injured as indicated by ISS (38.79 vs. 26.1 p&lt;.001). Abdominal patients who died (n=16) were more severely injured as indicated by ISS (22.56 vs. 13.38 p&lt;.001), had lower SBP (72.36 vs. 125.81 mmHg p&lt;.001) and DBP (50.36 vs. 82.8 mmHg 1 p&lt;.001) blood pressures. They were more acidotic by pH (7.04 vs. 7.33), had larger base deficits (14.86 vs. 5.7 p&lt;.001), higher ED CO2 (22.67 vs. 20.03 p&lt;.01) and had a lower Sao2 (76 vs. 96.83 p&lt;.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We show that stratification of trauma 1 pages predicts different outcomes. Patients who went directly to OR had more physiologic abnormalities than CT patients. Development of early warning systems for trauma preparedness could be developed utilizing prehospital parameters. Effective prehospital evaluation and trauma team activation metrics need to be developed to accurately identify injury severity for proper trauma paging with possible OR not ED rescucitation for these patients.

The aim of our study is to describe outcomes of isolated-severe TBI patients undergoing craniectomy.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a one-year (2017) analysis of the Trauma Quality Improvement Program. We identified adult (&ge;18 years) blunt trauma patients with isolated-severe TBI (head AIS&ge; 3; GCS&le; 5; extra-cranial AIS&le; 2) who underwent craniectomy. Primary outcome was discharge disposition. Secondary outcomes were survivor-only length of stay (LOS), and repeat craniectomy. Descriptive statistics were performed.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 490 adult, isolated-severe TBI patients who underwent craniectomy were identified. Mean age was 46&plusmn;18 years, 74.1% were male, and median ISS was 26[21-30]. Median time to first craniectomy was 143[100-295] minutes. Overall, 63% survived, of whom 54% were either discharged to home or in-patient rehabilitation, and later time to craniectomy was associated with increased survival (Figures).

Video review of these procedures provides granular time-based data for performance improvement. Using resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) as a model, we sought to compare three methods of data collection (abstraction from trauma video review (TVR), retrospective electronic medical record review (EMR) and prospective real-time observation (PRO)) with the hypothesis that TVR data collection results in less missing data and less bias than EMR or PRO.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We included patients undergoing RT at an urban academic trauma center. Key data on the timing and completion of 104 milestones of RT (including time of arrival, medications, and elements of RT such as aorta cross-clamp) were collected using TVR, EMR, and PRO. We used chi^2 to compare missing milestone data between methods. TVR recorded timing directly, and we calculated bias in measurements of time elapsed for EMR and PRO with respect to TVR.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We included 148 patients (mean age of 27, 88% male, 95% Black, 79% with penetrating trauma). TVR had less missingness than EMR (15% vs. 19%, p=&lt;.001) or PRO (15% vs. 27%, p=&lt;.001) including in such key milestone variables as time of incision (0% vs 24% and 20%, p&lt;.001), time of pericardiotomy (9% vs 100% and 41%, p&lt;.001), and time of aortic cross-clamp (22% vs 35% and 45%, p&lt;.005). There was not significant evidence of a difference between EMR review and prospective review (p=.09). For timing data alone, video review was also significantly more granular than EMR review (p&lt;.0001) and prospective observation (p=.0038). Prospective and EMR timing data showed 6%-193% bias for indicators of interest, with a mean bias of 68%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In high impact, low frequency procedures such as RT, data collected using TVR results in less missingness and bias than data collected by EMR review or PRO. EMR data may be limited by competing priorities. PRO may be limited by an observer&rsquo;s ability to see what is happening and their knowledge of the procedure at hand. Additionally, unlike prospective real-time data collection TVR abstraction does not require continuous research assistant presence. For these reasons, TVR represents the gold standard in data collection for research and quality improvement efforts resuscitative thoracotomies.

Chicago experienced a historic gun violence surge in 2016 with dramatic decline to baseline rates in 2018. This study aimed to understand the 2016 Chicago peak in gun violence through the direct accounts of violence prevention and intervention focused community-based organizations (CBOs) in Chicago.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Participants were recruited from a list of 40 violence prevention and intervention focused CBOs in Chicago. A semi-structured interview guide was developed with insight from qualitative experts and non-participant staff from a close partnering CBO. The interview sought to understand factors associated with the 2016 gun violence peak and how it compared to the current spike in violence. 30-60 minute interviews were conducted with CBO representatives and clients, which were audio recorded and transcribed. A code book was created and coding of all transcripts by two coders with iterative reconciliation was performed. Thematic analysis was conducted to discover central themes. Category formulation and sorting was done for data reduction and thematic structuring of the data. The range and central tendency of these themes are reported.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

19 representatives from 14 organizations were interviewed from the south, west and northside of Chicago. Poverty was a central theme of Chicago&rsquo;s 2016 gun violence spike. Poverty manifested through infrastructural and community-level disinvestment in violence-affected communities with subthemes below.

CBO participants highlighted lack of funding for violence prevention and intervention as a subtheme and precursor to 2016&rsquo;s violence. Illinois&rsquo; July 2015 budget impasse cut critical funding for CBOs, resulting in diminished or ceased operations city-wide which preceded the start of the 2016 peak.

Second, CBOs identified marginalized youth as a key subtheme to the 2016 spike. Lack of opportunities for youth aged 14-19 drove them to join groups engaged in violence that could offer protection, opportunity and support in resource-limited communities.

A third subtheme reported by CBOs was justice-seeking retaliation in response to unsolved violent injuries and homicides. Participants described a pervasive disengagement from police and mistrust in the justice system, leading victims and families to seek justice through extra-judicial means that contributed to 2016&rsquo;s peak. Participants noted that lack of guardianship by law enforcement made communities feel unsafe and isolated.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

Poverty is a central theme associated with gun violence through infrastructural and community-level disinvestment. Violence prevention and intervention focused CBOs offer insights into the array of contributors that are unique compared to that of researchers and law enforcement.

Marsh-Armstrong<sup>1</sup>, M. D. McCarter<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, School Of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, Department Of Surgery, Division Of Surgical Oncology, Aurora, CO, USA&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, Surgical Outcomes And Applied Research (SOAR), Aurora, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors specific to the GI tract. Important prognostic features of primary GISTs include tumor mitotic rate, tumor size, tumor location, and mutational status, yet one common feature of primary GISTs for which prognostic significance is unknown, is mucosal ulceration. The current study aims to investigate whether ulceration is an independent prognostic factor of GISTs.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective study was conducted of 513 patients who received care at a tertiary referral center with a suspected or documented diagnosis of primary GIST between the years of 2000 and 2020. Relevant patient sociodemographic and clinicopathologic information was extracted from the electronic medical record. Ulceration was confirmed by definitive documentation in the endoscopic or histopathologic report. The significance of ulceration in GIST was then compared to other known prognostic factors and patient prognosis. This study was approved by the institutional IRB. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

Of the 513 patients reviewed, 310 primary GIST patients with known ulceration and disease status were identified and assessed for further analysis. Of those, approximately 27.4% (n=85) demonstrated mucosal ulceration. Gastrointestinal bleeding (65.9%) was the most common indication for endoscopy in which patients were found to have an ulcerated GIST at endoscopy. This compared to incidental finding (44.0%) and abdominal pain (36.9%) in the non-ulcerated group.

After a median follow-up of 35.4 (IQR=46.1) months, patients with ulcerated primary tumors experienced higher rates of tumor recurrence (31.8% vs 12.9%, p&lt;.001) and metastasis (34.1% vs 11.1%, p&lt;.0001) than the non-ulcerated GIST group. Likewise, ulcerated tumors were associated with a mitotic rate &gt;5/50 HPF (37.7% vs 16.9%, p&lt;.001). Ulceration was also associated with cKIT Exon 11 mutations (40.0% vs 24.9%, p=.009). Primary tumor location did not vary significantly across ulcerated and non-ulcerated groups, with gastric (62.4% vs 57.8%, p=.46) and small intestine (37.7% vs 36.4%, p=.84) sites accounting for the majority of locations. On univariate analysis, ulceration of GISTs was highly associated with disease progression (HR=2.66, 95% CI 1.61 &ndash; 4.39, p=.0001). Ulceration also appears to be an independent risk factor on multivariate progression-free survival analysis, pending additional evaluation.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Ulceration in gastrointestinal stromal tumors is associated with GI bleeding, increased mitotic rate, Exon 11 mutations and risk of disease progression. Overall, ulceration in GISTs is associated with elevated risks of tumor recurrence and metastasis, and appears to be an independent risk factor for disease progression. Further assessment of the significance of ulceration in GISTs is warranted.

Performance of major lung resections at high-volume (HV) hospitals has been shown to reduce operative mortality. However, what threshold of case volume meaningfully impacts surgical outcomes is unknown. We determined a clinically meaningful cut-point for defining HV centers for major lung resections and assessed the impact of hospital volume on surgical outcomes and overall survival.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We identified adult NCDB patients with SCLC/NSCLC undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy between 2004-2015. A multivariable model with restricted cubic splines was built to predict 5-year overall survival according to average yearly case volume, adjusting for demographic/clinicopathologic factors. This data was then analyzed using a change-point procedure which identified two regression lines and a distinct segmentation at 54 cases/year. Hospitals were subsequently divided into HV (&gt;/=54 cases/year) and low-volume (LV, &lt;54 cases/year) groups. Chi-square tests were used to analyze group differences. Logistic regression was utilized to assess the impact of hospital volume on surgical outcomes. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Our cohort consisted of 284,138 patients (31.5% treated at HV centers). Treatment at a HV center was associated with increased likelihood of R0 resection (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.35-1.46). Patients treated at HV centers were also significantly more likely to have an adequate lymph node evaluation of 10 or more nodes (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.68-1.74). HV centers also had significantly decreased 30- and 90-day postoperative mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.72-0.80 and OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.78-0.84; respectively) after adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidities, histology, surgery type, and stage. Stage-specific overall survival was significantly improved at HV vs LV centers.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Treatment at a HV center is associated with significantly improved oncologic and surgical outcomes. The performance of 54 major lung resections a year is a clinically meaningful cutoff to differentiate HV and LV centers. This should be considered when evaluating regionalization of lung cancer care to improve patient outcomes.

Prior work demonstrates that cancer patients are more likely to seek care at their local hospital when it is affiliated with a well-known cancer hospital, but recent evidence suggests that their outcomes may be worse. A better understanding of cancer center participation in health system integration is necessary to determine optimal strategies for delivering accessible, high-quality cancer care in an increasingly consolidated healthcare marketplace.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We aimed to describe the proportion and types of United States (US) Commission on Cancer (CoC)-accredited centers that are affiliated with a health system and to compare health systems that have a CoC-accredited center to those without a CoC-accredited center. CoC-accredited centers were identified from the CoC online search tool and categorized using CoC definitions. Health system participation and characteristics were determined by linkage to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Compendium of United States Health Systems.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 1,062 CoC-accredited adult hospitals, 95% are in a health system, including all NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers, and NCI-designated networks, 98% of academic cancer centers, 96% of comprehensive community cancer centers, and 99% of CoC-defined integrated networks. Eighty-nine percent of community cancer programs and 67% of hospital associate cancer programs are in a health system. Of 607 health systems evaluated, 434 (72%) had at least one CoC-accredited center. Compared to health systems with a cancer center, systems without an accredited cancer center have fewer hospitals, beds, and annual discharges, and are less likely to include a teaching hospital. Systems with a cancer center are more likely to have at least one hospital with a high uncompensated care burden, but there was a trend toward a greater higher overall uncompensated care burden in systems without a cancer center.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Most CoC-accredited cancer cancers participate in a health system, and most systems have at least one cancer center. Smaller non-academic systems are less likely to integrate a cancer center. While treatment in a system with a CoC-accredited center does not guarantee high-quality cancer care, treatment in a system without an accredited cancer center may exacerbate existing cancer care disparities.

Busch<sup>2</sup>, A. D'Angelo<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Studies report higher burnout in women faculty surgeons compared to men. However, little work has been done identifying underlying mechanisms for these gendered differences. Gendered differences in the experience of microaggressions, which are unconscious or subtle acts of discrimination against members of a minority group, may be one mechanism that explains this relationship. Therefore, we hypothesized that both burnout and gendered micro-aggressions are significantly higher in women faculty surgeons and that the presence of gendered micro-aggressions mediates the relationship between gender and burnout.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In this cross-sectional study, an electronic survey was sent to surgical faculty at seven institutions across the United States. Variables included gender identity, race, average hours worked over the past 2 months, the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), and a modified Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions Scale (REMS) to assess gender-based microaggressions. In previous literature, validity evidence has been established for this modified REMS quantifying the presence of gendered micro-aggressions in the workplace. To assess the hypothesis, a mediation model was tested using model 4 of the PROCESS Macro in SPSS. Confidence intervals were based on 5000 bootstrap samples.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 110 participants (40% female) completed the survey. The hypothesized indirect effect from gender to burnout (M = 2.70/5, SD = .81), through gender based microaggressions (M = 1.64/5, SD = 1.06), was significant, B = -.25, SE B = .17, CI [-.42, -.09]: female surgeons reported higher levels of gender-based microaggressions, which in turn predicted higher levels of burnout. The overall model was significant, R<sup>2</sup> = .15, F(4, 105) = 4.59, p = .002. See Figure 1 below for the full model with individual pathways. Neither covariate, race nor hours worked, were significant in the model.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Consistent with prior research, we found that female gender is marginally associated with higher rates of burnout. However, our work offers a potential mechanism behind this relationship: we demonstrate that gendered microaggressions mediate the relationship between gender and burnout. By identifying this underlying cause of burnout for women surgeons, we make a novel and important contribution to the literature and offer insight into a pressing phenomenon. These multi-institutional data provide a focus for targeted initiatives that could decrease the rates of burnout and the impact of gender bias on surgical faculty.

Mentorship has been well studied in the field of academic medicine and demonstrates a correlation with job satisfaction, retention, and success. While many surgical faculty may naturally develop mentor relationships within their division, we established a formal mentorship program to provide junior faculty with unbiased mentors to ensure success in their careers, to guide them toward successful promotion and to cultivate interdivision connections. We subsequently assessed satisfaction of this formal interdivision mentorship program.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The Department of Surgery Mentorship Program was established in 2016 to provide assistant professors with guidance in clinical and academic practice. The Vice Chair of Faculty Development selected the mentor-mentee pairings. Mentees were surveyed with an email questionnaire about the benefits, value, and drawbacks about the program.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The program had 34 mentor-mentee pairings since its inception. The mentee response rate to the survey was 74%. Overall, the mean program satisfaction was 3.72 out of 5 (5=best). Mentees who rated the program highly were more satisfied with communication, felt more comfortable with their mentors and did not feel burdened by coordination of meetings. The strongest predictor of satisfaction of the program overall was meeting frequency. The most satisfied participants met with mentors at least yearly, with the majority meeting every 6 months or more. Aligning with this finding, the most common feedback was suggesting meeting reminders for more frequent meetings. Areas that mentees felt they benefited most from was advice regarding promotion, developing a research plan, and time management.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Participants in a Department of Surgery Mentorship Program felt they benefited most from advice regarding academic promotion and guidance from mentors on factors contributing to academic success. Many mentees commented on their desire for more frequent meetings with their mentors. We will utilize the information gleaned from this survey to make adjustments and improvements in the program.

The objectives of this study were to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing residents as leaders of a large-scale institutional quality improvement effort and to evaluate trainees&rsquo; perceived education and value from participation in the project.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: As part of an institutional quality improvement initiative, trainees from the Departments of Surgery and Anesthesiology at a single academic medical center were teamed with institutional content experts in seven key risk factor areas within preoperative patient optimization. These risk factor domains included hematology, opioid dependence, social determinants of health, infectious disease/glycemia, nutrition, cognitive impairment, and frailty/prehabilitation. A systematic review of each subject matter area was performed using the MEDLINE database. Evidence-based statements and institutional recommendations for the screening and management of each risk factor were developed. These findings were presented to the Departments of Surgery and Anesthesiology and approved utilizing modified Delphi consensus methodology. Upon project completion, an electronic survey was administered to all individuals who participated in the process to assess the perceived value of participation.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 51 perioperative stakeholders participated in recommendation development: 26 trainees and 25 content experts. Resident physicians led 6 out of 7 groups specific to a subject area within preoperative optimization, tasked with organizing meetings, overseeing the literature review process, and drafting recommendations. A total of 4,649 abstracts were identified, of which 456 full text articles were selected for inclusion and used to guide the development of 29 evidence-based statements and 36 institutional recommendations. 17 out of 26 (65.4%) trainees completed the survey after completion of the project. The vast majority of trainees reported increased understanding of their preoperative optimization subject area (15/17 [88.2%]) as well as the Delphi consensus method (14/17 [82.4%]) from participation in the project (Figure). 14 out of 17 (82.4%) trainees stated that they would participate in a similar quality improvement initiative again.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We demonstrate a novel way to involve trainees in an institutional quality initiative which served to educate trainees in quality improvement, the systematic review process, Delphi methodology, and preoperative optimization. This study provides a framework that other residency programs can use to engage residents in large-scale institutional quality improvement efforts.

We hypothesized that residency programs&rsquo; online presence would have increased utility and influence for applicants.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Substantial surgery residency website modifications were undertaken in the summer of 2020. Pageviews were gathered by our institution&rsquo;s information technology office for comparison across years and programs. An anonymous, voluntary, online survey was sent to all interviewed applicants for our 2021 general surgery program match. Five-point Likert-scale questions evaluated applicants&rsquo; perspective on the online experience.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our residency website received 10,650 pageviews in 2019 and 12,688 in 2020 (p=0.14). Pageviews increased with a greater margin compared to the anesthesia program (p&lt;0.01). From 108 interviewees, 75 completed the survey (69.4%). They indicated our website was satisfactory or very satisfactory compared to other programs (83.9%) and none found it unsatisfactory. Applicants overall stated our institution&rsquo;s online presence impacted their decision to interview (51.6%). Programs&rsquo; online presence impacted the decision to interview for white applicants (68%), but significantly less for non-white applicants (31%, p&lt;0.03). We observed a trend that those with fewer than average interviews (&lt;18) put more weight on online presence (65%), compared to those with greater than 18 interviews (35%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Applicants utilized program websites more during the 2021 virtual application cycle; our data show most applicants depend on institutions&rsquo; websites to supplement their decision-making.

In this study we trended the demographic, additional degrees pursued, and scientific publication characteristics of the past presidents of major academic surgical societies to gain an understanding of the changing faces in surgical leadership. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Board Certified Docs database was queried for demographic information of the past presidents of the Association of Academic Surgeons (AAS), Society of University Surgeons (SUS), and American College of Surgeons (ACS). The Web of Science database was queried for the quality and quantity of their publications from 1970 to 2020. Measures of academic output, including author&rsquo;s personal impact factor (m-index) and number of publications were compared pre and post induction. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 140 presidents were identified from AAS, SUS and ACS. There were no female presidents before 1990, and percentage of female presidents significantly increased from 10% in the 2000s to 36.7% in the 2010s (p=0.028). The non-White presidents significantly increased from 6.6% in the 2000s to 40% in the 2010s (p&lt;0.001). The most common area of expertise in the 1970s was cardiothoracic surgery (27%) and has shifted to surgical oncology (27%) in the 2010s. There were 40% of presidents who held an additional degree in the 2010s as compared to the 13.3% in the 2000s (p=0.039), with the bulk being MPH (15%) (Figure 1). Bibliometric analysis reveals a significant higher number of publication per year in the post-induction phase than the pre-induction phase (11.81 &plusmn; 19.57 vs 5.45 &plusmn; 3.92, p&lt;.001), as well the m-index (2.03 &plusmn; 1.68 post-induction vs 1.39 &plusmn; 0.79 pre-induction, p&lt;.001). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There have been changing faces in the academic surgery leadership. The improved gender and racial representation in academic surgery leadership mirrors the recent gender and racial equality movement. The increasingly pursued advanced degrees potentially confers the leaders an advantage in facing the challenges of the dynamically evolving healthcare landscape. Past presidents&rsquo; high research productivity and impact in the post-induction phase may be an indication of their maturity and extensive collaborations in the scholarly pursuit.

Transitioning from medical student to surgical intern is accompanied by increased responsibility, stress, and clinical burden. This environment lends itself to imposter syndrome (IS), a psychological condition grounded in self-doubt causing fear of being discovered as fraud despite adequate abilities. While prior studies confirmed preresidency preparatory courses effectively improve learners&rsquo; clinical skills and knowledge, their effect on IS remains unknown. We aimed to determine whether a two-week surgical boot-camp for fourth-year medical students would improve confidence in technical skills, knowledge, and IS.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Thirty medical students matching into surgical specialties completed the boot-camp in February 2020. Pre/post-surveys assessed confidence levels using a 1-5 Likert scale regarding 32 technical skills and knowledge points organized into four assessment categories. IS was assessed using the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), a widely used validated tool to assess internal experiences of fraudulence and worthlessness; the higher the score, the more frequently and seriously IS occurs (CIPS&lt;40: few IS characteristics, 41-60: moderate, 61-80: frequent, &gt;80: intense). Pre and post-survey results were linked to subjects using randomly assigned identifiers which remained blinded to study investigators.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Median subject age was 27 years (IQR 26, 28), 20 (66.7%) were male, and 21 (70%) were Caucasian. 23 (76.7%) had a break in training with a median of 2 years (IQR 1, 3) outside of medicine. Table 1A revealed significantly improved confidence scores in all assessment categories when comparing pre vs post-surveys (p&lt;0.05). 28 (93%) subjects had moderate, frequent, or intense imposter syndrome characteristics both before and after the course. However, when comparing pre vs post-surveys there was no change in median CIPS [65.5 (IQR 52, 75) vs 64 (52, 75), p=0.70]. Females had higher pre-survey CIPS than males [68.4 (SD15.2) vs 61.6 (14.9), p=0.02]. There was no strong correlation between age and CIPS in the pre-survey (SRCC 0.29, p=0.19) or post-survey (SRCC 0.31, p=0.10). While subjects who worked outside of medicine had a stronger relationship with IS (SRCC 0.37, p=0.05), multivariate regression analysis (Table 1B) did not reveal significant differences when adjusting for age, gender, race, years worked outside of medicine, or breaks in medical training.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

We found imposter syndrome to be highly prevalent among medical students who matched into surgical subspecialties with 93% affected by moderate, frequent or intense IS. While we found surgical boot-camp to improve trainee skill and confidence, IS was unchanged. This further confirms IS is unrelated to skill. We advocate for the use of surgical boot-camps as a tool to prepare medical students for residency, along with additional research to identify strategies to improve IS among surgical trainees to avoid future burn out.

Elkbuli<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Nova Southeastern University, Miami, FLORIDA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Kendall Regional Medical Center, Department Of Surgery, Division Of Trauma And Surgical Critical Care, Miami, FLORIDA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Citations provide readers with the source of information being referenced within a study, crediting previous work that has been conducted on the topic. Accurate citation practices are key to furthering knowledge in an efficient and valid manner. Previous studies on citation inaccuracies have been limited by small sample sizes and only investigated journals from specific surgical subspecialties. The objective of this study is to investigate the prevalence of citation inaccuracies from 2015-2020 in original research studies from the top 10 ranked surgical journals and to identify common citation inaccuracies and
evaluate potential solutions to prevent them.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective study evaluating the citation accuracy of the most cited original research studies in the top 10 surgical journals from 2015-2020. Of the 600 included studies, 10 citations were randomly selected and evaluated for accuracy. Categories of inaccuracy included fact not found, study not found, contradictory conclusion, citation of a citation, and inaccurate population.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 5973 citations were analyzed for accuracy. The evaluated studies were cited a mean of 78.5 times and referenced an average of 30.5 citations. Out of the citations analyzed, 15.2% of them contained an inaccuracy, of which 77.2% were major inaccuracies. There was no statistically significant difference in inaccuracy rates from 2015-2020 (p=0.38). Annals of Surgery, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Annals of Surgical Oncology had significantly more citation inaccuracies than other journals evaluated (p&lt;0.05). JAMA Surgery, The Journal of Endovascular Therapy and The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery had significantly fewer citation inaccuracies. We identified no significant difference in the citation inaccuracy rate (p=0.21) between studies based on level of evidence.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although 84.8% of citations from 2015-2020 were determined to be accurate, citation inaccuracies continue to be a prevalent issue throughout highly-ranked surgical literature. Not all citation inaccuracies are detrimental to science, however there is a high risk for the dissemination and propagation of misinformation, posing serious implications on research credibility and patient care practices. There are many possible solutions for the prevention and correction of inaccuracies, however widespread adoption may be limited by lack of awareness. Future research should continue to track citation inaccuracies over time and evaluate the adoption and effectiveness of these solutions.

Mukherjee<sup>1</sup>, A. Abbott<sup>1</sup>, C. Streck<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Medical University Of South Carolina, Charleston, Sc, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: For decades, the 3-digit Step 1 score has been used to competitively evaluate and compare candidates during the residency application process; however, in 2022 all scores will be converted to pass/fail. Another quantitative measure will likely gain importance in its stead, one such being clerkship performance grades.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This study aims to determine the consistency and reliability of clerkship grades for general surgery applicants. Candidates&rsquo; Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) letters from 146 unique US medical schools were reviewed for number of grading tiers used and honors criteria from the 2019 application cycle.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The median number of grading tiers for each core clerkship was four. Over a third of medical schools (35.5%) do not provide overall medical student performance rank. Schools in the Central US region more often rank their students in five tiers compared to the South (p&lt;0.005). Variable percentages of students achieve the highest honor tier across the core clerkships; an average of 35% of students meet the highest honors criteria in Surgery. More students at US News and World Report Top 20 medical schools achieve the highest honors tier, and this was found to be statistically significant across every clerkship and overall class rank (Fig 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Medical schools grading variability may challenge residency programs&rsquo; ability to stratify desirable applicants. In conclusion, further transparency and standardization may be required to compare students objectively and fairly from medical schools across the country.

Shelton<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Medical students encounter a wide range ethical dilemmas and professionalism issues during their clinical rotations. These issues reflect students&rsquo; perceptions of their learning environment that will impact their professional development and shape how they may handle such challenges independently. Given the intensity of the environment, surgical rotations are anecdotally perceived as more challenging than medical rotations. However, it is unknown if the type of ethically challenging cases experienced are different between the disciplines, and how students work through them. Here, we utilize our longitudinal bioethics curriculum database to understand if there are unique problems encountered in surgical rotations in an effort to tailor teaching and maximize student education on these difficult topics.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All third-year medical students on their Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Surgery rotations were surveyed as a part of the required ethics and professionalism curriculum during the 2020-2021 academic year. Students described a patient care concern they observed on the rotation, which they categorized as: ethical, professional, quality of care, or medical. They indicated if they shared their concerns with a mentor, wish to emulate the mentor, and if they experienced moral distress related to the case. These variables were compared between surgical clerkships (&ldquo;SC&rdquo;, Surgery and OB/GYN) and non-surgical clerkships (&ldquo;NSC&rdquo;, Internal Medicine and Pediatrics).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 1,068 cases were submitted across the clerkships. Cases categorized under professionalism were more common in SC than in NSC (25.4% vs 13.4%, p&lt;0.001) while quality of care concerns were cited more frequently in NSC (39.2% vs 29.5%, p&lt;0.01). Ethical and medical issues were similar between the groups. Students in SC were less likely to share their concerns with a mentor or wished to emulate the mentor than those in NSC (both p&lt;0.001). Finally, the degree of moral distress experienced in responses to these cases in SC was greater than in NSC (p&lt;0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The categories of concerns and dilemmas reported by students differ by rotation, and medical students in SC are less likely to share their issues with a clinical mentor than NSC. This presents an opportunity for surgical educators to improve communication and approachability to encourage students to discuss ethical and professionalism concerns that they have. With residents more commonly acting as clinical mentors in SC than NSC, this education can be broadened to include house staff. These findings highlight the importance of addressing issues that are specific to the surgical field early in graduate medical education so that residents can practice openness and model exemplary behavior for the students they teach.

<strong>Introduction</strong>: Recent social justice movements, Me Too (2017) and Black Lives Matter (2020), have highlighted the need for improved diversity and inclusion. These movements have emphasized the need for inclusivity of all genders and races in all sectors including surgical editorial boards. There is currently not an established, standardized method to assess the gender, racial and ethnic makeup of surgical editorial board rosters, yet artificial intelligence is a method that can be utilized to determine gender and race in an unbiased manner. The aim of the present study is to determine if recent social justice movements correlate with an increase in diversity-themed articles published and if there is an increase in the gender and racial makeup of surgical editorial boards determined by artificial intelligence software.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Impact factor was used to assess and rankhighly regarded general surgery journals. The website of each of these journals was examined for pledges of diversity in their mission statements and core beliefs of conduct. To determine the number of diversity-themed articles that were published during 2016 and 2021, each surgical journal was analyzed for diversity-themed articles using 10 specific keywords in PubMed. To determine the racial and gender makeup of editorial boards in 2016 and 2021, we obtained the current and the 2016 editorial board roster. Roster member images were collected from academic institutional websites. Betaface facial recognition software was used to assess the images. The software assigned the gender, race and ethnicity of the image supplied. Betaface results were analyzed using a Chi Square Test of Independence. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We analyzed 17 surgical journals. Only 4 of 17 journals were found to have diversity pledges on their website. For diversity themed publications, 1% of articles in 2016 and 2.7% in 2021 were published specifically about diversity. There was a significant increase in the amount of diversity articles/journal published per year in 2016 (6.59) compared to 2021 (25.94, P&lt;0.001). There was no correlation between impact factor and articles that publish diversity keywords. 1,968 editorial board member images were analyzed using Betaface software to determine gender and race in both time periods. There was no significant increase in diversity of editorial board members regarding gender, race, and ethnicity temporally from 2016 to 2021.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In the present study, we found that although the number of diversity-themed articles has increased over the last five years, however the gender and racial makeup of surgical editorial boards has not changed. Further initiatives are needed to better track and diversify the gender and racial composition of surgical editorial boards.

Quaintance<sup>1</sup>, M. Moncure<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Missouri Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, MO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented disruption in medical education worldwide. Due to the volatile nature of this virus, medical education was radically changed from in-person learning to virtual teaching. It was thought that the loss of hands-on, collaborative experience would be a detriment to medical education. However, it has also been shown that this change in medical education has demonstrated students&rsquo; ability to adapt, innovate, and understand the dynamic nature of medicine. The goal of this project is to determine the effectiveness of the new clinical curricula created due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical clerkship at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: IRB approval was granted from the University of Missouri-Kansas City. De-identified data was collected regarding students&rsquo; performance on the Clinical Performance Evaluations from June 2019 to February 2021. Pre-COVID data ranged from June 2019 to February 2020, and COVID data ranged from June 2020 to February 2021. Secondary outcomes measured included students&rsquo; NBME scores, standardized patient exam scores, and overall clerkship grades. Data analysis was conducted via T-test to determine any differences in clinical evaluations.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The comparison of students&rsquo; Clinical Performance Evaluation scores from before COVID-19 to during COVID-19 demonstrated no stastically significant difference, with a p-value of 0.170. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference when comparing students&rsquo; NBME scores, Standardized Patient Exam scores, and overall clerkship grades, with p-values of 0.214, 0.390, and 0.194, respectively. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted medical education in a multitude of ways. Students had to adjust to online education platforms, which decreased their ability for hands-on clinical experience. However, the implementation of online teaching webinars, simulations, and educational clinical skills videos allows students to engage in content they would learn during their in-person clinical experience. The data from this study demonstrates no significant difference in any outcomes between the students who experienced the traditional, pre-COVID teaching methods versus the students who experienced the new COVID clinical curriculum. Students were able to successfully accustom themselves to this new way of learning. This data demonstrates students were able to successfully integrate the new curriculum into clinical practice. The continued use of virtual tools, such as simulations, clinical videos, lectures, and workshops can benefit surgical trainees. Further studies should be conducted with other core clerkships to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the effectiveness of their new curricula.

Rogers<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Physician&rsquo;s high rates of burnout have been shown in several studies to be related to external environmental factors such as perceptions of job demands and resources. Job crafting is one strategy from other professions that can improve balance between job demands and resources to enhance wellbeing. We hypothesized that a job crafting intervention for healthcare leaders would result in improved wellbeing, lower burnout, and enhanced job resources. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Residency program directors and other leaders at one tertiary academic medical center were invited to participate in a two-workshop series on job crafting. Fourteen individuals across 6 departments enrolled and completed an electronic survey before and after the sessions that included the Well-Being Index (WBI), Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9), Job Resources scale of the Job Demands Resources Questionnaire, and Job Crafting Scale, as well as a session evaluation. Pre- and post-intervention scores were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank sum tests. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
All but one participant completed both pre- and post-intervention surveys (93%). Satisfaction with the job crafting intervention was high, with 86% agreeing it was useful overall and that they could apply information from the sessions. 93% stated it was a valuable use of their time and would recommend it to others. Participants increased their job crafting behaviors following the intervention, with 46% increasing structural and social resources (p=0.03), and 85% decreasing hindrance demands (p=0.02). Increased meaning in work was identified by 38% post-intervention (p=0.04). No statistically significant differences were identified in WBI scores at high risk for burnout pre- and post-intervention (86% for both), but 30% of participants had an absolute improvement (decrease) in their WBI score. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
A job crafting intervention was associated with high rates of satisfaction among multi-specialty healthcare leaders at one institution. The intervention was successful in increasing job crafting behaviors and perceptions of meaningful work, but did not result in a change in risk for burnout. Future efforts will be directed at modifying this intervention as a full leadership development program.

As of 2019, medical schools are admitting equal numbers of men and women and leaders in academic surgery have targeted efforts to increase the numbers of underrepresented minorities (including women) in surgery. In 2020, 43.1% of all general surgery residents at ACGME accredited programs were women indicating an increasing interest in surgery among female medical students. The purpose of this study is to examine the proportion of women in academic surgery at our institution and compare it to national rates. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Roster was utilized to collect faculty data based on department, rank, and gender at both our institution and nationally in the year 2020. Faculty count was assessed at the end of each calendar year per AAMC national reporting standards. Faculty were stratified based on rank: professor, associate professor, assistant professor, and instructor. Only faculty with full-time appointments in the department of surgery were included. Chi-square tests were performed for categorical variables with an alpha level of 0.05. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 109 full-time faculty at our institution in 2020, 27.5% are female compared to 26.9% nationally. There was no significant difference in proportion of female assistant professors at our institution compared to nationally (43.2% vs 30.6%, p=0.108). There was no significant difference in proportion of associate professors (25.0% vs 23.3%, p= 0.834) at our institution compared to nationally. The proportion of female professors both at our institution and nationally were not significantly different, but both were the lowest proportion of any rank (11.8% vs 13.7%, p=1.00). There was no significant difference in proportion of female instructors (33.3% vs 58.8%, p=0.238). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite national and institutional focus on eliminating disparities, women are still underrepresented in surgery at every academic rank nationally. Future studies must examine the barriers to promoting women within academic surgery.

The lasting impact of reduced caseloads and service redeployments on procedural-resident training has been underexplored. This longitudinal study investigates the long-term perspectives of residents and faculty on resident technical skill decay over time.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Web-based cross-sectional surveys were distributed to residents and faculty immediately after, (July, 2020) and one year after, (July, 2021) COVID-19 related redeployments at two large, academic medical centers in New York. Residents (91) and teaching faculty (36) of general surgery, plastic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, urology, and anesthesiology programs were surveyed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 52 residents and 33 faculty from 6 specialties completed the follow-up survey at one year. As consequence of redeployment and reduced case volumes by 90%, 64% of residents and 75% of faculty reported a significant reduction in resident technical skills in the short term, with significantly less (41% of residents and 21% of faculty) reporting persistent reduction in technical skill after one year (p&lt;0.05). Residents who were concerned about fulfilling ACGME case requirements (44%) were more likely to endorse skill decay initially (p&lt;0.05); however, after one year, significantly fewer residents (16%) were concerned about achieving ACGME case requirements (p&lt;0.05). 75% of residents and 100% of faculty were confident residents would be able to practice independently at conclusion of their training. 67% of residents and 64% of faculty felt that residents experienced a durable improvement in critical care skills. Residents also reported a positive long-term impact on professional core competencies at one year.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite the immediate perception of resident technical skill decay after pandemic-related redeployments, after one year, residents and faculty were less likely to endorse skill decay, instead reflecting positively on attainment of other nontechnical skillsets. Furthermore, the majority of residents were no longer concerned about case volumes and consequence on technical skill development. Longitudinal surveillance of residents after a short-term redeployment suggests recovery of temporary skill decay and return of resident confidence upon resumption of traditional training. Procedural resident trainees exhibit resilience in their ability to effectively bounce back after a break from usual practice. Promoting resident progression relies not only on ensuring depth of operative volume to develop technical skills, but also on supporting comprehensive clinical experiences to foster other essential competencies.

Tele-Education Assisted Mentorship in Surgery (TEAMS) is a novel educational methodology that utilizes remote hands-on high-fidelity low-cost simulation and longitudinal individualized mentorship to teach and support the adoption of new surgical techniques.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: TEAMS was used to teach ten oncoplastic breast surgical techniques to 27 rural and international general surgeons from August 2020 to May 2021. Participants had online didactic lectures and delivery of a box of synthetic simulation materials to their residence. The 3-hour remote hands-on course included clinical videos, live demonstrations, and individualized mentorship during simulation. Longitudinal individualized mentorship continued post-course. Course satisfaction, learner confidence, surgical technique utilization, and mentorship interaction were assessed at the end of the course and then at 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Analysis of variance and linear regression were performed.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Follow-up survey data was available for 74.1% of learners. High levels of course satisfaction were reported (mean rating: 4.52/5); 100% of respondents reported the course changed their practice and accomplished the learning objectives. Learner confidence significantly improved for all ten oncoplastic breast surgical techniques and positively correlates with the frequency of surgical technique utilization (R2= 0.4793) (p=0.027) (Figure).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: TEAMS is a novel educational methodology to support surgeons in the adoption of new surgical techniques. Personalized delivery of simulation materials and training along with surgical technique utilization reinforces learner confidence.

There is an abundance of published &ldquo;resident-as-teacher&rdquo; programs (RATPs), but most are geared towards medicine-based services. This study explores what medical students found to be the most valuable characteristics and teaching methods of their best surgical resident teachers.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Semi-structured interviews were conducted of third and fourth year medical students at a single academic institution. Interviews followed a guide based on personal experiences with a single, self-selected resident teacher from the participant&rsquo;s surgery core clerkship. Analysis proceeded using the inductive and comparative approach of interpretive description.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Six students were interviewed. When asked about the characteristics of the best surgical resident teacher, participants were most likely to reference the resident&rsquo;s intentionality with teaching, ability to create a safe welcoming environment, and role model behaviors (Table 1). Most participant teaching encounters were in the form of chalk talks that their resident teacher intentionally set aside time for, mainly on whiteboard or paper. Overall, meaningful learning opportunities occurred through close observation of their resident&rsquo;s behaviors and interactions. The most common challenges to teaching that participants acknowledged were time constraints specific to surgery (compared to internal medicine) and working with difficult team dynamics.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The best resident teachers on the surgery clerkship exhibit distinct qualities that foster student learning. These findings offer a basic framework about the makings of effective surgical resident teachers, serving as a reminder that a little extra investment in medical students can go a long way.

However, the role of the H-index in the promotion of surgical faculty is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the H-index of surgical faculty at the time of their promotion to Associate(ASSOC) and Full Professor(FULL).


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We reviewed the data of 34 faculty from Department of Surgery at our institution who had been promoted during the years 2006 to 2021. Gender, years of hiring, positions at hiring, years of promotion, years used for each promotion, tenure status, and academic productivity at year of hiring, year of each promotion and years between promotions were obtained. Academic productivity was assessed by bibliometric indices including total number of publications, total times cited and H-index, which were obtained from Web of Science. Data of faculty who were promoted from assistant professor(ASSIST) to ASSOC were compared to faculty who have been ASSIST for at least 5 years from hiring to 2021(n=11). Continuous data was reported as mean &plusmn; standard deviation. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare bibliometric indices between different groups. Linear regression was used to assess the factors associated with time needed for promotions. Statistics analysis was performed with IBM SPSS 27.0. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistical significance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 2006 to 2021, 31 faculty were promoted to ASSOC. At hiring, faculty who were promoted to ASSOC had significantly more citations than their cohorts who were not promoted(452.2&plusmn;767.7 vs. 170.6&plusmn;311.6, p=0.035). At the time of ASSOC promotion, faculty had 43.2&plusmn;47.6 publications, 986.3&plusmn;1189.4 citations and H-index of 13.3&plusmn; 8.6 with a median of 11.0. It took faculty 5.6&plusmn;2.3 years from hiring to ASSOC promotion. H-index at hiring was independently associated with the time needed for ASSOC promotion.(F(1, 26) =10.371, p=0.003, adjusted R square 0.258, unstandardized beta= -0.167, p=0.003). From the time of hiring to ASSOC promotion, promoted faculty had 21.5&plusmn;33.5 publications and gained 664.4&plusmn;1011.6 more citations. When comparing these to the academic productivity of cohorts who hadn&rsquo;t been promoted since hiring, not promoted cohorts had less publications(10.18&plusmn;9.9, p=0.005) and less citations(32.0&plusmn;26.1, p&lt;0.001). 11 faculty were promoted to FULL. It took faculty 7.0&plusmn;3.0 years to be promoted from ASSOC to FULL. At the time of FULL promotion, faculty had 37.82&plusmn;30.1 publications, 890.6&plusmn;566.7 citations and H-index of 13.9&plusmn; 7.7 with a median of 15.5.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: For surgery faculty, H-index at the promotion of ASSOC and FULL were 13.3&plusmn; 8.6 and 13.9&plusmn; 7.7 respectively at our institution. 5.6&plusmn;2.3 years and 7.0&plusmn;3.0 years were needed for promotion to ASSOC and FULL respectively.

Some specialties, in particular, have persistently been perceived as unfriendly to LGBTQI+ trainees; consistently among them has been the field of general surgery.

This study aimed to describe the perspective of current medical students regarding LGBTQI+ education and the acceptance of LGBTQI+ trainees among different specialties.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A cross-sectional voluntary anonymous online survey was distributed through REDCap to all medical students (n=495) at a state medical school. Medical students&#39; sexuality and gender identity were queried. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed, the responses were classified into two groups: LGBTQI+ and non-LGBTQI+.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 212 responses were queried. 80% of all respondents perceived Orthopedic Surgery to be the least LGBTQ+ friendly among all specialties followed by General Surgery (75%), and Neurosurgery (51%).

After analyzing sexual orientation as an influence on choosing a future specialty for residency only 1% of non-LGBTQI+ students indicated that their sexual orientation influences their specialty of choice in comparison with 30% of LGBTQI+ students (p&lt;0.001). Finally, more non-LGBTQI+ students indicated that they believe they are receiving appropriate education on caring for LGBTQI+ patients as compared to LGBTQI+ students (71% and 55%, respectively, p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
LGBTQI+ students are still hesitant to pursue careers in General Surgery as compared to their non-LGBTQI+ peers. The perception of surgical specialties to be the least welcoming to LGBTQI+ students continues to be a concern for all students. Further strategies of inclusivity and their effectiveness need to be studied.

Anjaria<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Veterans Affairs New Jersey Health Care System, Department Of Surgery, East Orange, NJ, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>New Jersey Medical School, Department Of Surgery, Newark, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: It is pivotal for surgery residents to develop both surgical skills and confidence; two essential elements for any competent surgeon. There have been increasing concerns over lack of preparedness for surgical trainees to practice independently after completing residency as evident by the increasing number of residents who seek fellowship, as well as surveys of residents, faculty, and program directors. We have previously shown that resident autonomy has decreased overtime overall for surgery residents. The purpose of this study is to examine changes in operative autonomy in surgical residency within each PGY level.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective analysis of the Veterans Association Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) database. All general surgery, vascular surgery, and thoracic surgery cases performed at Veterans Affairs hospitals from 2004 to 2019 were included. Cases were categorized and analyzed by level of resident autonomy, PGY level, and year of operation. Level of resident autonomy is defined based on documented &ldquo;primary operating physician&rdquo; at the conclusion of each surgery in the database as follows: attending primary (AP), attending operating with resident (AR), or resident primary without attending scrubbed (RP). Work portion of CMS RVU (wRVU) as defined by VASQIP was used to capture the complexity of the surgical case. Standard statistical tests were used to analyze and compared level of resident autonomy and case complexity between different PGY levels throughout the years.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 444,712 cases were analyzed, with 85% of cases being AR, and 8% of cases RP. At each PGY level, the percentage of RP cases ranged from 6.05% to 10.68%, with the highest percentage found at the PGY5 level. From 2014 to 2019, the number of RP cases across each PGY level declined significantly (Table 1). Analysis of wRVU from 2004 to 2019 did not show any trend within each PGY level. Inguinal hernia repair is the most commonly performed RP case across all PGY levels.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Cases with the resident as the primary surgeon without an attending scrubbed have markedly decreased over time and this holds true in all PGY levels. This effect is most profound at the PGY 3 level, possibly due to a shift in training focus during the early years of residency from intraoperative skills to perioperative management and critical care. Chief residents are affected by the degradation of operative autonomy to a lesser degree. Case complexity has seen a progressive increase by PGY level afforded to resident autonomous cases, which is appropriate. The complexity of cases has remained relatively stable over time within each PGY level, demonstrating that the decrease in resident autonomy is not due to changes in case complexity. Provided that the case is level appropriate, residents should be given more autonomy in the operating room as early as possible in their training.

A resident cosmetic clinic was created at our large academic center in 2007 to address the need for independent assessment and treatment. The cosmetic clinic has traditionally provided non-surgical facial rejuvenation with neuromodulators and soft-tissue fillers. This study focuses on an assessment of the patient population seen in the clinic to identify typical referral patterns in an effort to understand patient motivations and enhance recruitment and create a comprehensive resident experience.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective chart review of all the patients seen in our institution&rsquo;s Plastic &amp; Reconstructive Surgery Resident Cosmetic Clinic was performed from 1/1/2019 to 8/13/2021. Patient demographics, type of injectable received (neuromodulator versus soft tissue filler), location of injection, additional cosmetic procedures and referrals were examined.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 106 patients met study criteria. Median age of patients was 46 (range 24-77). A total of 88 (83%) patients received only neuromodulator, 9 (8.5%) only receiving soft tissue filler, and 9 (8.5%) receiving both. The most common muscles for neuromodulator injection were the frontalis, corrugators and procerus. 52 (49%) patients worked in healthcare at our institution, 8 (1%) were self-employed, 23 (22%) were retired or had no occupation listed. Of the 106 patients, 41 (39%) had been seen two or more times in clinic. Only 19 (18%) patients had undergone additional cosmetic procedures. Sixteen of the 106 patients were referred to the resident clinic from the attending cosmetic clinic.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients seen in the resident cosmetic clinic were largely middle age females employed at the institution; with the majority of receiving neuromodulator injections. Patients were occasionally referred to the resident clinic from attending cosmetic clinic. The results of this study and a parallel study investigating population trends in attending clinics may better inform the best process for recruitment and expansion, which would certainly improve resident education.

In order to continue resident education, the Virtual Education Platform (VEP) and Virtual Visiting Professorship (VVP) lectures were immediately created and implemented for plastic surgery residents. This study investigates the efficacy and progression of the VEP on resident learning since the start of the pandemic.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Since its creation in March 2020, the VEP consists of VVP lectures, grand rounds, journal clubs, portfolio conferences, M&amp;M conferences, and national plastic surgery organization lectures held over Zoom (Zoom, Inc., San Jose). Each week, plastic surgeons from various institutions present VVP lectures on their fields of expertise. In May 2020, residents and speakers completed two different surveys that assessed the effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages of the VEP and VVP using a 5- point Likert scale. In August 2021, follow-up surveys were administered to residents to re-assess the efficacy of the VEP and VVP. Wilcoxen rank and chi square tests were conducted to compare survey responses between 2020 and 2021.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 19 (90.5%) residents and 10 (90.9%) speakers responded to the 2020 surveys. 15 (88.2%) residents responded to the 2021 follow-up survey. In 2020, speakers represented nine academic institutions, including one internationally. 90% of speakers thought the VVP was very important to resident education. 60% of speakers preferred in-person over virtual lectures. 89.5% of residents agreed that the VVP should continue after the shelter-in-place is lifted.

From the follow-up survey, 73% of residents agreed that didactics are better done virtually than in-person. 100% of residents agreed that virtual conferences should remain a core medium in residency education, even after social distancing requirements subside.

Easy accessibility without travel time was the most commonly mentioned advantage of the VEP for residents in both 2020 (57.9%) and 2021 (93%), with significantly more residents citing this benefit in 2021 as compared to 2020 (X<sup>2</sup> = 5.4, p=0.02). The most commonly reported disadvantage for residents was the lack of social interaction and community in both years (36.8% and 46.7%, respectively). Since the start of the VEP, residents&rsquo; attitudes shifted such that significantly more residents liked and were satisfied with the VVP lectures between 2020 and 2021 (p=0.04). The VVP lectures were also mentioned as the most helpful lectures for residents in both years (94.7% and 46.7%, respectively).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The VEP and VVP received overwhelmingly positive feedback. Virtual education continues to be integral to resident education as effective learning can still be achieved. The VVP is novel in its quick development, implementation, and high efficacy during an unprecedented time. Future studies should survey larger audiences to understand the long-term benefits and how to create a greater sense of community.

Although positive volume-outcome relationship has been demonstrated for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and stenting (CAS), the impact of race and insurance on access to high volume centers (HVCs) remains unstudied. The present study aimed to assess race- and insurance-based disparities in access to HVCs and revascularization strategy (CEA vs CAS).

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adults (&ge; 18 years) undergoing CEA or CAS were identified in the 2005-2018 National Inpatient Sample. Annual, institutional volume of CEA and CAS were tabulated, and hospitals in the top quartile annually were considered HVC. Multivariable logistic models were developed to evaluate the association of race and insurance status with undergoing operation at HVC or undergoing CAS versus CEA. Logistic and linear regression was used to examine the impact of HVC on mortality, stroke, and costs.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of an estimated 1,317,256 eligible patients, 12.7% were non-White and 6.8% were underinsured. Compared to White patients, non-White patients less frequently received care at HVC (56.4% vs. 61.5%, p=0.002) and more frequently underwent CAS instead of CEA (20.5% vs 14.7%, p&lt;0.001). Similarly, underinsured patients less frequently received care at HVC (57.6% vs 60.4%, p=0.001) and more frequently underwent CAS over CEA (21.8% vs. 15.1%, p&lt;0.001). Receiving carotid revascularization at HVC was associated with improved outcomes, including decreased odds of mortality (AOR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99) and stroke (AOR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.68-0.86), and a reduction in hospitalization costs by $2,700 (95% CI: 2,200-3,200). After adjustment, Black, Hispanic, and other non-White patients had lower odds of undergoing carotid revascularization at HVC compared to White patients, as did Medicaid and uninsured patients relative to those with private insurance (Figure). Non-White patients had greater odds of undergoing CAS over CEA (AOR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.06-1.26, ref: White patients). Similarly, uninsured patients (AOR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.15-1.38) as well as those with Medicaid (AOR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.13-1.30) had greater odds of undergoing CAS rather than CEA compared to privately insured patients.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Compared to White and privately insured patients, racial minorities and underinsured patients have reduced access to high volume hospitals and have greater odds of undergoing carotid stenting rather than endarterectomy. Further systemic efforts to provide equitable access to specialized centers may reduce the observed disparities in carotid revascularization.

Lattimore<sup>1</sup>, T. N. Showalter<sup>1</sup>, S. L. Showalter<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Adjuvant radiation is standard treatment after breast conserving surgery (BCS) in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) involves the delivery of a single dose of radiation to the tumor bed at the time of BCS. Data is inconsistent regarding cosmetic outcomes after treatment with conventional breast IORT (CB-IORT), with many studies showing inferior results compared to whole breast irradiation (WBI). Precision Breast IORT (PB-IORT) is a novel method that improves CB-IORT through customized, three-dimensional treatment planning for an accurate, higher dose IORT that better targets at-risk breast tissue. PB-IORT avoids radiation to the skin and chest wall, potentially improving cosmetic outcomes. To date, PB-IORT has been shown to provide excellent cosmesis. The purpose of this study is to determine factors associated with poor cosmetic outcomes in patients treated with PB-IORT.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
PB-IORT is offered as part of an ongoing multi-institutional Phase II clinical trial. The study cohort consisted of all patients treated at the University of Virginia that had completed a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. Patients completed the Harvard cosmesis evaluation at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. A poor cosmetic outcome was defined as scoring &ldquo;fair&rdquo; or &ldquo;poor&rdquo; on the Harvard Cosmesis evaluation, or &ldquo;some&rdquo; or &ldquo;very much&rdquo; on any of the three general cosmesis categories (color, size, or shape). Univariate statistical analysis was performed utilizing R statistical software.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The final cohort included 201 patients of which 167 (81%) had a good cosmetic outcome and 39 (19%) had some aspect of a poor cosmetic outcome. The two groups didn&#39;t significantly differ in BMI, smoking status, or tumor size. The two groups didn&#39;t differ in catheter fill volume or skin to catheter distance. Factors associated with any aspect of a poor cosmetic outcome included having DCIS (58.8% vs 79;5%, p=0.03), postoperative seroma (26.0% vs 48.1%, p=0.04), re-excision for positive margins (1.3% vs. 10.3%, p=0.01), re-excision for close margins (0.63% vs 7.9%, p=0.02), and receipt of additional radiation (0.6% vs 10.3%, p=0.01). All patients with a poor cosmetic outcome had DCIS in their pathology specimen.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
PB-IORT is unique in the ability to allow for individualized treatment while sparing normal tissues. These results demonstrate that tumor and procedural factors affect cosmetic outcomes. Those with positive or close margins are at increased risk for a poor cosmetic outcome. Importantly, these findings demonstrate the deleterious effects that additional surgery and WBI have on cosmetic outcomes after treatment with PB-IORT.

Verma<sup>1</sup>, K. Darbinian<sup>1</sup>, J. Festekjian<sup>1</sup>, P. Benharash<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of California - Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flaps are increasingly used over other autologous methods of breast reconstruction. We examined the relationship between hospital expertise and resource use in patients undergoing DIEP breast reconstruction and hypothesized increasing center volume to be independently associated with reduced hospitalization costs and complications.

<br><br><strong>Method</strong>: 

All elective adult (&ge;18 years) hospitalizations for DIEP flap breast reconstruction were tabulated using the 2016-2018 Nationwide Readmission Database. Patient, hospital and operative characteristics including laterality were ascertained. Annual volume of DIEP reconstructions at each center was treated continuously with restricted cubic spline analysis in order to characterize the relationship between volume and index costs. High Volume hospitals (HVH) were defined as those above the inflection point of the volume spline while others were considered low volume (LVH). Mixed regression models were developed to delineate the association of covariates with outcomes of interest.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of an estimated 21,675 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 4,914 (23%) received a concomitant mastectomy while 11,907 (55%) had bilateral DIEP reconstruction. Utilization of DIEP increased significantly throughout the study period (45% in 2016 to 56% in 2018, p&lt;0.01) and accounted for 51% of all autologous reconstructions performed in 2018. The mean costs for isolated DIEP reconstruction were $32,907 [IQR 32,479-33,168] and $35,149 [IQR 34,441-36,037] with concurrent mastectomy. After performing restricted cubic spline analysis, the threshold cutoff point was determined to be at 55 annual cases. Compared to LVH, reconstructions at HVH incurred significantly lower unadjusted costs ($30,589 vs. $35,837 p&lt;0.001) and shorter hospital stay (3.7 vs 4.7 days, p&lt;0.05). On adjusted analysis, more recent calendar year (&beta;: -$938, 95% CI -1347, -529) and age (&beta;: -$243/year, 95% CI -284, -203) were independently associated with decreased costs. Increasing hospital volume exhibited an inverse relationship with hospitalization costs as shown in the Figure. HVH status was linked to lower odds of overall (AOR 0.50 p&lt;0.01), thrombotic (AOR 0.17 p&lt;0.01) and wound complications (AOR 0.10 p&lt;0.05) as well as 90-day readmissions (AOR 0.62 p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Despite the highly complex and specialized nature of DIEP reconstruction operation, it now constitutes for more than 50% of all autologous flap breast reconstructions in the US. Despite wide adoption, a strong inverse cost-volume relationship persists which may better inform policy and referrals to suitable centers for DIEP breast reconstruction.

Murine femoral artery wire injury (FAWI) is a commonly used model of neointimal hyperplasia, an inflammatory process resulting in restenosis and failure of surgery for arterial occlusive disease. High-parameter flow cytometry allows high-resolution classification, quantification, and sorting of cell populations from a single tissue sample, but has not previously been used to study the dynamics of post-operative inflammatory cellular infiltration following FAWI.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We designed an 18-fluorochrome flow cytometry panel for leukocyte identification in digested femoral artery (FA) samples. C57BL/6 mice underwent FAWI followed by euthanasia at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days post-injury. Injured left femoral arteries and uninjured right femoral arteries were enzymatically digested into single cell suspensions that were stained and analyzed on a BD FACSymphony A5 flow cytometer and FlowJo v10 software. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of femoral artery frozen sections from the same time points with CD45 primary antibodies was used to validate leukocyte quantification from flow cytometry.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Both IF cell counts and flow cytometry quantification suggest that infiltrating CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes plateau in quantity by 7 days post-injury, then begin to decline by 14 days post-injury (Figure, panel A). As expected, injured femoral artery samples demonstrated significantly higher numbers of live leukocytes (Live/Dead<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup>) than uninjured femoral arteries at the 1-day (54,883 vs. 777 cells, p=0.05), 3-day (32085 vs. 534 cells, p=0.004), and 7-day (49,885 vs. 970 cells, p=0.02) post-injury time points. Using our high-parameter flow cytometry panel, we were able to identify and quantify live leukocyte (Live/Dead<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup>), CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>), B-lymphocyte (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>), neutrophil (CD45<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup>), NK cell (CD11b<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>), eosinophil (SiglecF<sup>+</sup>), dendritic cell (CD64<sup>-</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>), classical/intermediate/non-classical monocyte (CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD64<sup>-</sup>Tim4<sup>-</sup>), and multiple macrophage (CD64<sup>dim</sup>/<sup>+</sup>Tim4<sup>-</sup>/<sup>+</sup>) sub-populations and quantify them across a 14-day post-injury time course (Figure, panel B). Leukocyte infiltration at the 1-day post-injury time point was dominated by neutrophils, however, by 7-days post-injury, macrophage sub-populations composed the majority of infiltrating leukocytes.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our high-parameter flow cytometry method allows for broad phenotyping of highly defined leukocyte sub-populations infiltrating in the arterial wall following FAWI with a single staining panel. This methodology has numerous downstream applications, including time-series analyses, cell sorting for gene expression analyses, identification of inflammatory surrogate markers (in conjunction with cytokine analysis), and correlation with vascular lesion formation.

Providing a functional copy of the deficient fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) gene in utero, before development of a fully functional immune system, can induce tolerance to the transgene as well as mitigate concerns for immune reaction to the viral vector, and rapid expansion of fetal cells may improve the extent of liver repopulation with genetically corrected hepatocytes while preventing early organ damage from disease. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Direct fetal intrahepatic injections of a lentiviral vector carrying the human FAH gene under control of the alpha-1 antitrypsin promoter were performed in six FAH<sup>-/-</sup> pig fetuses at 66-73 days of gestation at a dose of 3x10<sup>8</sup>-1.6x10<sup>9 </sup>transducing units per fetus. Mothers were maintained on the protective drug 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) through gestation, and piglets were maintained on NTBC until weaning. After weaning, four pigs were cycled on/off NTBC to stimulate expansion of FAH-positive hepatocytes. Cure was determined through clinical, biochemical, and histological parameters: NTBC-independent growth; normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests; and liver repopulation with corrected, FAH-positive hepatocytes. PCR screening of maternal and fetal tissues was performed to evaluate for target and off-target vector presence. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics analysis was also performed to explore lentiviral integration profile in the liver. Finally, RNA sequencing was performed to evaluate changes in hepatic gene expression after in utero gene therapy as compared to no treatment, NTBC treatment, and wild-type. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of the long-term animals, two achieved NTBC independence immediately, without requiring any cycles on the drug, and two achieved NTBC-independent growth at 35-72 days post-weaning, after 2-4 cycles on the drug. This was accompanied by normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels showed an age-appropriate decrease over time. On immunohistochemical analysis, FAH-positive hepatocytes were present at birth and had begun to clonally expand by 8 days of life. This expansion continued over time, with complete repopulation with FAH-positive hepatocytes seen by 278 days of life, and no evidence of histopathological abnormalities or hepatocellular carcinoma found. NGS showed a benign lentiviral integration profile within the liver that was broadly reproducible between animals. RNA sequencing showed a gene expression profile after in utero gene therapy that approached that of wild-type animals and was markedly different from that of FAH<sup>-/-</sup> animals off NTBC.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Lentiviral liver-directed gene therapy delivered in utero provides a stable, long-term cure for HT1 with an acceptable safety profile for both mother and fetus.

Rosengart<sup>1</sup>, M. Neal<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Pittsburgh, Surgery, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Exposure to differing wavelengths of light affects various physiologic processes such as immune response to sepsis and ischemia reperfusion. Previous data has suggested a role of circadian regulation in fibrinolysis and thrombosis. We hypothesized that varying light exposure prior to induction of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) would attenuate the subsequent immune cell response.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Mice were exposed to ambient light (N =15, fluorescent white light, 400 lux), blue light (N = 15, 442 nm, 1,400 lux), and red light (N = 15, 617 nm, 1,400 lux) with a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle for 72 hours. After 72 hours of light exposure, mice were subjected to an experimental model of DVT formation that includes complete ligation of the inferior vena cava (IVC). Thrombus and blood samples were harvested for analysis. Neutrophils were isolated from mice exposed to the varying wavelengths of light and the degree of neutrophil extracellular trap activation (NETosis) was measured. Next, the supernatant of activated platelets (releasate) was isolated from the platelets of animals exposed to ambient, red, or blue light and NETosis was measured on ex vivo neutrophils after exposure to the platelet releasate.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Exposure to red light resulted in reduced clot weight compared to blue light-exposed mice (Ambient 16.5&plusmn;7.7mg, Red 4.2&plusmn;5.1mg, Blue 19.9&plusmn;8.7mg; p&lt;0.01, Fig 1A). Immunofluorescence images of thrombus revealed lower cellularity and reduced NET formation in the red-exposed thrombi (Ambient NETs per neutrophil in thrombi 0.16&plusmn;0.02, Red 0.11&plusmn;0.09, Blue 0.40&plusmn;0.08; p&lt;0.01 Red vs. Blue). Isolated neutrophils from red light-exposed mice also showed reduced NETosis ex vivo. Strikingly, platelet releasate from these animals markedly reduced neutrophil activation (Figure 1B).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Taken together, these data suggest that red light exposure results in reduced thrombus burden by attenuating NETosis in venous thrombosis. Fewer NETs are noted in the thrombus and reduced NETosis is seen in neutrophils of red light-exposed animals. Platelets in these animals show reduced activation, suggesting that the mechanism for this phenomenon may be a result of reduced platelet-neutrophil interactions.

It is also the leading cause of death with COVID-19. Acute inflammation is a central feature in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury (ALI) and subsequently ARDS. The need for mechanical ventilation can further exacerbate lung damage by ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Current treatment for ARDS is mainly limited to supportive care. We have previously shown that intratracheal (IT) delivery of CNP-miR146a, a radical scavenging cerium oxide nanoparticle (CNP) conjugated to the anti-inflammatory microRNA(miR)-146a, reduces bleomycin-induced acute lung injury by decreasing inflammatory infiltrates and oxidative stress. We hypothesized that CNP-miR146a treatment would further protect against secondary VILI by decreasing pro-inflammatory signaling in a bleomycin lung injury model.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 8-10 week old C57BL/6 mice (n = 64) were given IT bleomycin (5units/kg) to induce lung injury or 50&mu;L saline (control). Three days following injury, mice received IT administration of 1ng/50&mu;L CNP-miR146a (Bleomycin + CNP-miR146a) or an equivalent volume of saline (Control, Bleomycin). At seven days post-injury, a subset of mice were anesthetized, tracheostomized, and mechanically ventilated for 3 hours at tidal volume 20cc/kg, respiratory rate 75 breaths/minute, and positive end expiratory pressure 3 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 (+VILI). Whole lungs were then harvested and processed for total RNA extraction. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to evaluate expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA (p&lt;0.05 significant).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In this two-hit model, we found that bleomycin injured lungs were prone to a second-hit injury from mechanical ventilation. Compared to ventilated controls, ventilated bleomycin-injured mice had significantly higher relative gene expression of pro-inflammatory IL-6 (p = 0.0272), IL-8 (p = 0.0168), and TNF&alpha; (p = 0.0253). In addition, treatment with CNP-miR146a significantly lowered expression of IL-6 (p = 0.015), IL-8 (p = 0.0061), and TNF&alpha; (p = 0.0002) compared to control, ventilated, bleomycin-injured mice.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Treatment of bleomycin-induced lung injury with CNP-miR146a significantly decreases pro-inflammatory gene expression and provides additional protection against inflammation due to secondary VILI. CNP-miR146a has significant promise as a potential therapeutic for the treatment of ARDS and mitigation of secondary VILI.

Via pre-transplant serum cytokines and chemokines, we have identified a pre-LT biomarker panel, the immune frailty index (IFI), which accurately stratifies patients at high risk for post-transplant morbidity and mortality. Patients with low IFI (score 0-2) have 95.5% 1yr survival compared with 46.2% for high IFI (score 3-4). The exact genetic mechanisms responsible are largely unknown. Here we evaluate the gene expression patterns responsible for these immunophenotypic alterations.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patient serum was obtained pre-transplant and PBMCs isolated per protocol. Multiplex cytokine and chemokine analysis was performed via Luminex. IFI was calculated from pre-transplant HCV viremia, Eotaxin, MMP3, and Fractalkine. IFI-high were matched 1:2 with IFI-low based on age, sex, and cause of liver disease and were compared to healthy controls (NHC). RNA-seq was performed on isolated PBMCs and gene expression patterns assessed. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Gene expression analysis was performed on 22 LT recipients (n=7 IFI high, n=15 IFI low) and eight NHCs. Donor and recipient characteristics were similar between groups. IFI high had more positive cultures within 1-yr post-op (4 vs 1, p&lt;0.01) and lower 2-yr survival (56% -v- 100%, p&lt;0.01). PCA analysis demonstrated four patterns of gene expression (clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4). Four patients died during a median follow up of two years, all within the IFI-high group. Among these, 3/4 (75%) died secondary to infection-related complications (i.e. immune dysfunction), all in cluster 3. IFI-high patients predominantly grouped in cluster 3 and showed the most variability when compared to NHCs, cluster 5 (Figure 1). Gene pathway analysis revealed oxidative phosphorylation genes were comparatively upregulated and glycolysis was downregulated in cluster 3. Specifically, genes responsible for mitochondrial respiration were significantly upregulated in cluster 3, suggesting dysregulated cellular energetics. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pre-transplant immune dysfunction in LT recipients is associated with significant alterations in immune cell metabolics, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. This leads to impaired cellular function and differentiation. This may direct immune frailty and increase LT recipients&rsquo; susceptibility to post-operative complications and death. A better understanding of these pathways will allow for better assessment and targeted interventions for patients pre-transplant to improve outcomes.

Ronnekleiv-Kelly<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin, Department Of Surgery, Division Of Surgical Oncology, Madison, WI, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Wisconsin, Biotechnology Center, Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The circadian clock is a cell-autonomous molecular feedback mechanism found in nearly every organ of the body that is designed to maintain homeostasis. Previous studies have suggested disruption of the clock in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may portend worse outcomes for patients. We sought to further understand the ramifications of disrupting clock function on PDAC progression.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: CRISPR/Cas9 was utilized to achieve circadian disruption by knockout of the core circadian clock gene Arntl in a cell line derived from an aggressive PDAC mouse model (Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup> Tp53<sup>-/-</sup> Pdx-1 Cre (KPC)). Two separate Arntl knockout clones (KPC<sup>AKO</sup>) were validated with targeted sequencing and western blot analysis. To create tumors, a total of 100,000 cells from either KPC or KPC<sup>AKO</sup> clones in 50 &mu;L (1:1 DMEM:Matrigel) were injected into the right flank of 6&ndash;8-week-old syngeneic wildtype C57Bl/6J mice. Tumors were measured twice weekly for 28 days, and tumor weight was collected at the study endpoint. To assess for the presence of chemotherapeutic resistance, cells were subjected to gemcitabine and cell survival and Caspase 3/7 activity were assessed. All in vitro experiments were independently replicated three times.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Sequencing of both KPC<sup>AKO </sup>clones indicated the presence of an identical frameshift mutation of Arntl resulting in early truncation of the ARNTL protein. Loss of protein was confirmed with western blot analysis. Heterotopic flank tumor experiments revealed an early acceleration of cell growth in both KPC<sup>AKO</sup> clones resulting in larger tumor weight (Figure 1). To identify additional mechanisms of selective growth advantage, cell survival was compared following 48-hours of gemcitabine treatment, which demonstrated resistance of both KPC<sup>AKO</sup> clones compared to wildtype KPC (IC50 28 and 21 vs. 12 nM [p=0.03]). Increased survival of the KPC<sup>AKO</sup> cells was found to be secondary to increased resistance to apoptosis with 25 nM-1 &mu;M treatment (2.6-5.3-fold increased resistance; all p&lt;0.05). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The core circadian gene Arntl is essential for maintaining clock functionality. Disruption of Arntl in a PDAC cell line led to a more aggressive cancer phenotype and conferred resistance to gemcitabine &ndash; a backbone of PDAC chemotherapy. Furthermore, KPC<sup>AKO</sup> resistance appeared to be secondary to decreased apoptosis. Future experiments will begin to parse the mechanism by which loss of Arntl promotes PDAC progression and therapeutic resistance.

M. Lattimore<sup>1</sup>, T. N. Showalter<sup>1</sup>, S. L. Showalter<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Adjuvant radiation is standard treatment after breast conserving surgery (BCS) in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) involves the delivery of a single dose of radiation to the tumor bed at the time of BCS. Data is inconsistent regarding cosmetic outcomes after treatment with conventional breast IORT (CB-IORT), with many studies showing inferior results compared to whole breast irradiation (WBI). Precision Breast IORT (PB-IORT) is a novel method that improves CB-IORT through customized, three-dimensional treatment planning for an accurate, higher dose IORT that better targets at-risk breast tissue. PB-IORT avoids radiation to the skin and chest wall, potentially improving cosmetic outcomes. To date, PB-IORT has been shown to provide excellent cosmesis. The purpose of this study is to determine factors associated with poor cosmetic outcomes in patients treated with PB-IORT.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
PB-IORT is offered as part of an ongoing multi-institutional Phase II clinical trial. The study cohort consisted of all patients treated at the University of Virginia that had completed a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. Patients completed the Harvard cosmesis evaluation at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. A poor cosmetic outcome was defined as scoring &ldquo;fair&rdquo; or &ldquo;poor&rdquo; on the Harvard Cosmesis evaluation, or &ldquo;some&rdquo; or &ldquo;very much&rdquo; on any of the three general cosmesis categories (color, size, or shape). Univariate statistical analysis was performed utilizing R statistical software.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The final cohort included 201 patients of which 167 (81%) had a good cosmetic outcome and 39 (19%) had some aspect of a poor cosmetic outcome. The two groups didn&#39;t significantly differ in BMI, smoking status, or tumor size. The two groups didn&#39;t differ in catheter fill volume or skin to catheter distance. Factors associated with any aspect of a poor cosmetic outcome included having DCIS (58.8% vs 79;5%, p=0.03), postoperative seroma (26.0% vs 48.1%, p=0.04), re-excision for positive margins (1.3% vs. 10.3%, p=0.01), re-excision for close margins (0.63% vs 7.9%, p=0.02), and receipt of additional radiation (0.6% vs 10.3%, p=0.01). All patients with a poor cosmetic outcome had DCIS in their pathology specimen.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
PB-IORT is unique in the ability to allow for individualized treatment while sparing normal tissues. These results demonstrate that tumor and procedural factors affect cosmetic outcomes. Those with positive or close margins are at increased risk for a poor cosmetic outcome. Importantly, these findings demonstrate the deleterious effects that additional surgery and WBI have on cosmetic outcomes after treatment with PB-IORT.

Recently, investigators have demonstrated that NK cells may be primed for improved cytotoxicity following exposure to activating antigens such as cytokines or cells infected with virus. For these reasons, investigators have paired NK cells with other therapies, such as the targeted immunotherapy, dinutuximab, for high-risk neuroblastoma. We hypothesized that an oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV), M002, could improve NK cell-directed cytotoxicity of neuroblastoma cells. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: SK-N-AS human neuroblastoma cells (NB) and a human NK cell line that is easily expanded ex vivo, NK92 MI, were utilized. To assess cytotoxicity associated with combinatorial therapy, NB cells were pre-labeled with CMFDA Cell Tracker Green (labels alive cells) and then treated with increasing multiplicity of infection (MOI) of M002 (0-5 plaque forming units (PFU)/cell) for 24 h. Cells were then co-cultured with NK92 MI cells at an effector:target (E:T) ratio of 10:1 (NK:NB) for 24 h. The co-cultured NB cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) to detect dead cells and assessed with flow cytometry. Percent cell lysis was determined by the following formula (CMFDA+/PI+) / [(CMFDA+/PI+) + (CMFDA+/PI-)] * 100. To assess priming, NK cells were exposed to NB cells that had been infected with M002 at MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell for 24 h. Primed NK cells were then co-cultured with M002 infected NB cells and cytotoxicity assessed as previously described. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Combination treatment with M002 and NK92 MI resulted in a significantly greater cytotoxic effect on NB cells than treatment with either virus or NK92 MI cells alone (Figure 1A). When NK92 MI cells were primed for 24 h through exposure to NB cells that had been previously infected with M002, there was a significant increase in the ability of the primed NK92 MI cells to kill NB cells (Figure 1B, striped bar) when compared to unprimed NK92 MI cells (Figure 1B, black bar). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have shown that NK92 MI cells are a promising candidate for combination therapy with M002 for NB. The combination of oHSV and NK cells resulted in significantly greater NB tumor cell cytotoxicity than either oHSV or NK cells alone. Furthermore, previous virus infection of NB cells assisted in priming the NK92 MI cells and consequentially created a more robust anti-tumor immune response to oHSV infected NB cells. These findings validate the need to study this phenomenon further and advance to an in vivo model in anticipation for translation to the clinical arena.

Although positive volume-outcome relationship has been demonstrated for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and stenting (CAS), the impact of race and insurance on access to high volume centers (HVCs) remains unstudied. The present study aimed to assess race- and insurance-based disparities in access to HVCs and revascularization strategy (CEA vs CAS).

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adults (&ge; 18 years) undergoing CEA or CAS were identified in the 2005-2018 National Inpatient Sample. Annual, institutional volume of CEA and CAS were tabulated, and hospitals in the top quartile annually were considered HVC. Multivariable logistic models were developed to evaluate the association of race and insurance status with undergoing operation at HVC or undergoing CAS versus CEA. Logistic and linear regression was used to examine the impact of HVC on mortality, stroke, and costs.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of an estimated 1,317,256 eligible patients, 12.7% were non-White and 6.8% were underinsured. Compared to White patients, non-White patients less frequently received care at HVC (56.4% vs. 61.5%, p=0.002) and more frequently underwent CAS instead of CEA (20.5% vs 14.7%, p&lt;0.001). Similarly, underinsured patients less frequently received care at HVC (57.6% vs 60.4%, p=0.001) and more frequently underwent CAS over CEA (21.8% vs. 15.1%, p&lt;0.001). Receiving carotid revascularization at HVC was associated with improved outcomes, including decreased odds of mortality (AOR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99) and stroke (AOR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.68-0.86), and a reduction in hospitalization costs by $2,700 (95% CI: 2,200-3,200). After adjustment, Black, Hispanic, and other non-White patients had lower odds of undergoing carotid revascularization at HVC compared to White patients, as did Medicaid and uninsured patients relative to those with private insurance (Figure). Non-White patients had greater odds of undergoing CAS over CEA (AOR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.06-1.26, ref: White patients). Similarly, uninsured patients (AOR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.15-1.38) as well as those with Medicaid (AOR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.13-1.30) had greater odds of undergoing CAS rather than CEA compared to privately insured patients.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Compared to White and privately insured patients, racial minorities and underinsured patients have reduced access to high volume hospitals and have greater odds of undergoing carotid stenting rather than endarterectomy. Further systemic efforts to provide equitable access to specialized centers may reduce the observed disparities in carotid revascularization.

Despite its prevalence, there are no therapeutic modalities or serologic markers to help understand NAFLD activity, diagnose NASH severity, and elucidate mechanisms underlying disease progression. We evaluated 44 plasma cytokine, chemokine, and adipokine biomarkers and their associations with liver histology as potential discriminators of disease status in a cohort of severely obese patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Blood and a liver biopsy were obtained from 79 IRB-consented adult patients undergoing bariatric surgery at UF Health. Biopsy specimens were evaluated by a single, blinded pathologist for histologic features of NAFLD/NASH according to a validated NAFLD activity scoring (NAS) system (score from 0-8). NASH diagnosis was classified as definitive NASH or non-NASH. Fibrosis was scored according to Brunt criteria. Plasma inflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and obesity-related adipokine levels were quantified using Luminex multiplex immunoassays. Demographic data and medical history were also collected.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 18% of evaluated subjects were diagnosed with NASH. The NAFLD activity score distribution had a mean of 1.9 and a standard deviation of 1.8. The fibrosis stage distribution had a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 1.23. We found that IP-10 and CCL22 were associated with both NASH diagnosis and liver fibrosis. These associations hold when controlling for sex, age, BMI, diabetes, tobacco, and alcohol use. Diabetes was also strongly associated with NASH diagnosis. IP-10 was more strongly correlated with NASH diagnosis, while CCL22 was more strongly correlated with liver fibrosis. Using bivariate regression, we found those with a NASH diagnosis had higher IP-10 levels (P=.003). For every 1 pg/mL increase in IP-10, there was a .04% increase in the probability of having NASH. We also found that those with higher fibrosis scores had higher CCL22 levels (P=.001). For every 1 pg/ml increase in CCL22, there was a .0014 unit increase in fibrosis score. Circulating plasma IP-10 and CCL22 levels also correlated with each other, suggesting a common pathophysiological mechanism. A relationship between plasma IP-10 levels and NASH has previously been reported in subjects with NASH, NAFLD, and healthy volunteers as controls. Our results confirm those findings in severely obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that circulating plasma CCL22 levels may be a valid marker for liver fibrosis in patients with BMI&gt;35.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Non-invasive measures of NASH and hepatic fibrosis are critical for diagnosis and treatment. This work confirms the utility of IP-10 as a marker for NASH and provides evidence for CCL22 as a potential marker for NASH associated liver fibrosis. To the extent that these conditions overlap, they may be useful together as well.

El Ayadi<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch, Surgery, Galveston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Hypertrophic scars result from an increased production of extracellular matrix by myofibroblasts, which are regulated through TGF-&beta; signaling during the wound healing process. Current treatments to prevent or treat hypertrophic scars are suboptimal. However, inhibiting the TGF-&beta; signaling pathway may be a viable mechanism for pharmacologic treatment of hypertrophic scars. Therefore, the purpose of our present work was to investigate the effects of Galunisertib, a novel small molecular inhibitor of type 1 TGF-&beta;1 receptor (TGF-&beta;R1), in a wound healing and fibrosis in vitro model.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Primary neonatal dermal fibroblasts were treated with either recombinant human TGF-&beta;1 (10 ng/mL), Galunisertib (10 &mu;M), TGF-&beta;1 and Galunisertib, or siRNA for TGF-&beta;R1 knockdown. Our control group was defined as cells that did not receive any treatment. Scratch assays were preformed to assess fibroblast migration. Cells were seeded to a six-well plate (2.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well) and were grown to 90% confluence. Two parallel scratches (~500 &mu;m width) were created per well. Digital images were acquired at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours and analyzed for scratch gap closure through TScratch software. To examine the fibrotic TGF-&beta;1 signaling cascade, protein expression of phosphorylated SMAD, &alpha;SMA, and collagen-1a was assessed at 72 hours by Western blot. Gene expression of &alpha;SMA, fibronectin expression, CTGF, collagen-1a, MMP1, decorin, and collagen-3 were assessed through qRT-PCR at 72 hours. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Scratch assay analysis indicated that primary neonatal fibroblasts treated with Galunisertib alone increased wound closure rate compared to fibroblasts treated with TGF-&beta;1 alone (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, there was no significant difference in gap closure between TGF-&beta;R1 knockdown fibroblasts and fibroblasts treated with Galunisertib or TGF-&beta;1. Protein expression of phosphorylated SMAD and &alpha;SMA were reduced in fibroblasts treated with Galunisertib compared to fibroblasts treated with TGF-&beta;1. However, there was no significant difference in protein expression of collagen-1a. Galunisertib reduced the transcript level of TGF-&beta;-induced expression of &alpha;SMA, fibronectin, CTGF, and collagen-1a. Galunisertib increased gene expression of MMP1 and decorin. There was no significant difference in gene expression of collagen-3 in fibroblasts treated with Galunisertib.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Galunisertib can reduce the fibrotic phenotype of primary neonatal dermal fibroblasts, but also increase wound closure rate in vitro. Therefore, Galunisertib may be a potential option for pharmacologic treatment of hypertrophic scars.

Intimal hyperplasia (IH) in response to vascular injury has remained a common problem, such as in vein graft surgery.

Datasets were Robust Multichip Average normalized, and genes with significant transcriptomic activity were identified using the following analysis <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) analysis (p&lt;0.05 and log<sub>2</sub> fold change [lfc]=1), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA, p&lt;0.05 and FDR &lt;0.3), WGCNA-based correlation analysis (z score &lt;2), Cytoscape-based interactive network analysis, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Genes identified by IPA were analyzed for changes in gene expression between experimental (exposed to vascular injury) versus control (no vascular injury) conditions using t-tests, and genes with significant changes in transcriptomic activity in response to injury across multiple studies were identified. Analyses were performed sequentially (Fig 1).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The sequential analyses identified 113 dysregulated genes between experimental and control samples in one or more of the three studies. These genes are implicated in immune response, extracellular matrix remodeling, cell migration, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. Only 9 genes demonstrated consistent upregulation or downregulation in gene expression across the three different studies.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Systems biology analytic approach to the three studies of vascular injury has identified 9 signature genes that show consistent upregulation (SNAI2, PTTG1, CCNA2, CCNB1, CIT, JUNB, and HAT1) or downregulation (CAV1 and VEGFB) across all studies. These genes may serve as potential targets for future therapeutics to diminish intimal hyperplasia.

Overlapping surgery (OS) is defined as one attending physician supervising two or more operative cases simultaneously, without the critical portions of the cases occurring concurrently. To date, no study has examined the relationship of percent overlap, or the percentage of one case that is spent overlapping with another, to outcomes, efficiency, safety, and complications. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship of percentage of surgical overlap with perioperative and postoperative outcomes in order to determine if there is a detrimental level of overlap.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This study is a retrospective cohort study conducted at a large tertiary referral center in the Southeastern United States. The primary outcomes of interest included operative duration, in-hospital mortality, 30-day readmission, and patient safety indicators (PSIs) as identified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to evaluate the association between percent overlap and outcomes of interest. P-values of &le;0.05 were considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 87,426 cases were included in this study. There were 62,332 cases (71.3%) without overlap (Group 0), 10,514 cases (12.0%) with 1-25% overlap (Group 1), 5,303 cases (6.1%) with 26-50% overlap (Group 2), 4,296 cases (4.9%) with 51-75% overlap (Group 3), and 4,981 cases (5.7%) with &gt;75% overlap (Group 4). In-hospital mortality decreased as overlap increased with in-hospital mortality rates of 1.73%, 0.97%, 1.25% 1.17% and 0.71% in Groups 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively (p<sub>trend</sub>&lt;0.0001). Operative time increased with increasing overlap with mean times of 1.25 hours, 1.80 hours, 2.09 hours, 2.37 hours, and 2.49 hours in Groups 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (p<sub>trend</sub>&lt; 0.0001). Readmission rates showed no statistical significance between groups with readmission rates of 7.77%, 7.16%, 7.51%, 7.29% and 7.97% for Groups 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (p<sub>trend</sub>&lt; 0.0001). Rates of patient safety indicators were lower for Groups 1, 2 and 3 (1.69%, 2.01% and 2.08%) when compared to Group 0 (2.24%). Group 4 had the highest rate of patient safety indicatorss at 2.35% (p=0.0086). Of the PSIs studied, only iatrogenic pneumothorax (p<sub>trend</sub>=0.0430) and postoperative sepsis (p<sub>trend</sub>=0.0110) showed a statistically significant relationship to percent of overlap while no relationship was found for other PSIs.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 

This study provided insight into how the percentage of overlap does not significantly affect surgical outcomes. Overlapping surgery was shown to have reduced in-hospital mortality and similar patient safety indicator and readmission rates when compared to non-overlapping cases. Operative time was shown to increase in overlapping surgeries when compared to non-overlapping surgeries. The results from this study indicate that the percentage of overlap that occurs between cases does not detrimentally affect most patient outcomes, especially with overlap of less than 75%.

Kibbe<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill, School Of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Feinberg School Of Medicine - Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Sex bias has been prevalent in biomedical and clinical research and has negatively impacted disease detection, treatment, and outcomes in women. Several initiatives have been developed to foster sex-inclusive research including The Public Health Service Task Force on Women&rsquo;s Health Issues in 1985, the development of the Office of Research on Women&rsquo;s Health in 1990, the passing of the Revitalization Act in 1993, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy to account for sex as a biological variable in NIH-funded studies in 2015. However, it is unclear if these initiatives have had a positive impact on inclusion of both sexes in clinical research. The aim of our study was to determine if sex bias has persisted in human clinical trials, as measured by high-impact medical journal publications. Our hypothesis was that sex bias has persisted in high impact clinical research.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Original manuscripts published in JAMA, The Lancet, and The New England Journal of Medicine between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 involving human clinical trials were reviewed by 3 abstractors. Sex matching was calculated for included studies. Briefly, a study that is 100% sex matched and enrolled 100 participants, would have enrolled 50 participants of each sex. Statistical analysis was performed using pairwise comparisons from a one-sample chi-squared test for different factors which may affect the proportions of male vs. female participants.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1,442 manuscripts with 4,765,783 enrolled human subjects were included for analysis. Significantly more males (2,646,081; 56%) than females (2,119,702; 44%) were included among all 3 journals (P&lt;0.0001). Sex matching &ge;80% was found in only 24.6% of publications. Industry funded 43.7% of all studies and enrolled significantly more males than females (60.8% vs 39.2%, P&lt;0.0001). The NIH funded 10.2% of studies and enrolled significantly more females than males (52.7% vs 47.3%, P&lt;0.0001). North America and Europe contributed 82.5% of all studies and enrolled significantly more males than females (57.1% vs 42.9%, P&lt;0.0001). The United States contributed the most studies as a country (36.1%) and enrolled significantly more males than females (55.5% vs 45.5%, P&lt;0.0001). Cardiovascular disease contributed the most studies among the medical specialties (19%) and enrolled significantly more males than females (64.9% vs 35.1%, P&lt;0.0001). Studies analyzed by clinical trial phase, randomized vs non-randomized, interventional vs observational, and drug vs device all enrolled significantly more males (P&lt;0.0001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite the recognition of the importance of sex inclusive research, sex bias remains prevalent in high impact clinical research. Improvements have been made in NIH-funded clinical trials; however, this makes up a small percentage of overall studies published. There is a clear need to address the continued sex disparity in industry-funded clinical research.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Cross-sectional review of 1,135,743 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing one of three common surgical procedures performed in both the elective and unplanned settings &ndash; incisional hernia repair, colectomy, or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair between 2014 and 2018. Rates of unplanned surgery, 30-day mortality and readmissions were risk-adjusted using a multivariable logistic regression that accounted for patient factors (age, sex, Elixhauser comorbidities) and hospital characteristics (teaching status and nursing staffing ratios) and stratified by race and ethnicity.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 39.3% of procedures in the cohort were unplanned. Compared to White beneficiaries, unplanned surgery rates were significantly higher for Black (44.0% vs 38.8%, OR=1.29, p&lt;0.001) and Asian beneficiaries (40.4% vs 38.8%, OR=1.09, p&lt;0.001). While there were minimal differences in 30-day mortality for elective procedures (Asian vs White 4.8% vs 4.5%, OR=1.09 p&lt;0.001; Black vs White 4.8% vs 4.5%, OR=1.04, p&lt;0.001), unplanned procedures demonstrated a wider disparity (Asian vs White 13.2% vs 11.3%, OR=1.18, p&lt;0.001; Black vs White 12.4% vs 11.3%, OR=1.11, p&lt;0.001). Similar patterns of widening disparities for unplanned versus elective procedures was also observed for readmissions. For example, elective procedures had minimal differences (Asian vs White 13.7% vs 13.7%, OR=1.00, p&lt;0.001; Black vs White 14.6% vs 13.7%, OR=1.07, p&lt;0.001) while unplanned procedures had larger disparities (Asian vs White 19.1% vs 18.4%, OR=1.04, p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001; Black vs White 20.1% vs 18.4%, OR=1.11, p&lt;0.001).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Because unplanned procedures are more common among minority Medicare beneficiaries and demonstrate wider disparities in outcomes compared to elective management, reducing the rate of unplanned surgery among these groups is one potential strategy to reduce disparities in their postoperative outcomes.

Here, we examine racial/ethnic and gender representation among Chairs, Vice Chairs (VCs), and Division Chiefs (DCs) of surgery departments at medical schools in the United States (US).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Demographic data on surgical faculty including gender, race, ethnicity, and leadership position were abstracted by two independent reviewers from publicly accessible medical school and/or affiliate hospital websites, university-affiliated faculty profiles, and press releases. Discrepancies were resolved by a third independent reviewer. For each medical school, primary locations were defined as hospitals at which medical students completed their surgical clerkships. In accordance with AAMC categories, race/ethnicity was defined as White; Black or African American [BA]; Asian; American Indian or Alaska Native [AI/AN]; Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish Origin [HLS]; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander [NH/PI]; and Other. Underrepresented in medicine (URiM) was defined as BA, AI/AN, HLS, or NH/PI. Race/ethnicity and gender were compared across leadership categories using chi-square or Fisher&rsquo;s exact tests, as appropriate. Leadership categories with sample size &lt;15 were amalgamated into larger categories for analytical purposes (e.g., DCs of Burn, Emergency Medicine, and Trauma were combined).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1450 faculty across 146 programs were included. The majority of faculty in leadership positions were male (84.3%), however, a higher proportion of VCs were female (27%) compared to Chairs (14.5%) and DCs (12.4%, p&lt;0.001). Among VCs, the VC of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) had the highest proportion of female faculty (63.6%), and Executive VC had the lowest (7.1%). Across leadership positions, proportions of non-White faculty were consistently &lt;29%, dropping to &lt;10% when limited to URiM surgeons, who constituted only 8.3% of all surgical leadership. Among Chairs, intersectional analysis of gender and race/ethnicity revealed that White males constituted the highest proportion (64.6%) followed by White females and Asian males (both 9%). Notably, seven of the 13 DC categories and seven of the 8 VC categories had no female URiM leaders. URiM female leaders had minimal representation among DC positions (range 0.9-2.8%), while the only VC position with URiM female representation was VC of DEI (27.3%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is a severe lack of gender and racial/ethnic representation in surgical leadership. Representation of faculty who identify as both female and URiM is especially scarce.

This introduces selection bias into the case review process. While most institutions have databases used for targeted initiatives in quality improvement, these are not routinely used for M&amp;M conferences. We aimed to increase case capture for M&amp;M conferences by developing a novel system that augments the existing case submission system with complications from quality improvement databases and the electronic health record (EHR).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We implemented a novel system for increasing the capture rate of complications for M&amp;M conferences by developing custom software that combines data from the following sources: an existing voluntary case submission system for M&amp;M (referred to as voluntary case submissions here), local editions of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and Vizient quality databases, and the EHR. An EHR query system developed at our institution (PHAROS) was used to extract cases with the following complications: stroke code, code blue, death, and return to the emergency department within 72 hours of discharge. Our software harmonized all data sources and generated a comprehensive list of cases. We evaluated this novel system on a retrospective cohort of all postoperative complications for the Department of Surgery at a single tertiary medical center from July 1, 2019 to February 1, 2021.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 447 complications among all data sources. The most frequent complication was readmission (PHAROS: 26 cases, NSQIP/Vizient: 62 cases, Voluntary Case Submission: 26 cases). Inclusion of PHAROS, NSQIP, and Vizient databases into the existing case submission process introduced 294 new cases for M&amp;M review over the 32-month study period. The Vizient and NSQIP databases combined identified 207 cases that were not presented at M&amp;M conferences nor captured by PHAROS dataset. There were 50 cases captured only by the PHAROS dataset. There were 153 voluntary case submissions, of which 66 cases were also identified by either NSQIP, Vizient, or PHAROS. The Venn diagram attached shows the overlaps among the data sources.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: M&amp;M case review that relies solely on self-reporting is biased and incomplete. A novel system that includes complications identified in the EHR and quality improvement databases increased the case capture volume for surgical M&amp;M conference. Each data source in the system provided unique cases to the complications database. This approach provides an objective case referral system that can augment existing M&amp;M case submissions and identify complementary quality improvement opportunities.

Patients of minority backgrounds have reduced access to quality surgical care and experience disparate outcomes in operative morbidity and mortality. Surgical clinical trials allow for new innovative technology and therapeutic response to be established in the surgical patient. In this study, we aimed to assess the inclusivity of racial and ethnic minority patients in surgical clinical trials. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A database search was performed via clinicaltrials.gov using keywords &ldquo;Surgery,&rdquo; &ldquo;Surgical,&rdquo; &ldquo;Operations,&rdquo; &ldquo;Surgically,&rdquo; Invasive procedures,&rdquo; &ldquo;Operative therapy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Operative procedures.&rdquo; Inclusion criteria consisted of completed studies, with available results, and conducted within the US. Studies were excluded if they were conducted outside of the US (n=119) or were unrelated to surgical care (n=190) upon further review. Demographic data of trial participants were extracted from provided study results. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 883 surgical clinical trials including 153,407 participants were analyzed. Overall, gender was reported in 99.3% of surgical clinical trials. Data on race (42.1%) and ethnicity (26.3%) was notably less available. Though reporting has improved in the last decade, it remains low as only 57.3% of trials reported race and 37.3% of trials reported gender in 2020. The representation of Black (7.1%), Hispanic (5.9%), Asian (0.0%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (0.0%), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (0.0%) was remarkably low. On subspecialty analysis, the percentage of Black and Hispanic patients was higher in Bariatric (16.8%, 10%), Obstetrics (17.6%, 15.5%), Pediatric Surgery (25.3%, 4.9%), and Trauma (14.5%, 16.4%) surgical trials. Further, diversity in surgical clinical trials has not improved in the last decade (figure 1). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Racial and ethnic minority patients continue to be underrepresented in surgical clinical trials that are performed in order to establish operative and perioperative standards of care. Further efforts are needed to identify and address the reasons for these disparities in order to improve inclusivity and representation.

We sought to understand whether care at low-volume hospitals for complex surgery was associated with neighborhood deprivation, which has previously been shown to be a predictor of poor health outcomes, and dual-eligibility status, which is a proxy for social and unmeasured clinical risk.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We used 100% Medicare claims data for beneficiaries discharged between 2014-2016 from acute care hospitals for rectal resection, pancreatectomy, esophagectomy, and aortic valve replacement (n=115,246), all of which have well-established volume-outcomes relationships. We first used multivariable logistic regression to predict the probability of postoperative complications, stratifying patients into medically and socially high-risk groups based on census tract Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and dual eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid. We then used separate multivariable logistic regression models to predict receipt of care at a low-volume hospital, defined as hospitals in the lowest quintile of operative volume for a given surgery over the study period, controlling for patient- and hospital-level covariates.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: For all procedures analyzed, patients treated at low-volume hospitals were more likely to be non-white, be dual-eligible, be medically and/or socially high-risk, and hail from a neighborhood with a higher ADI (all p &lt; 0.05). Low-volume hospitals for all procedures were more likely to be smaller, have for-profit ownership, have a lower nurse-to-bed ratio, have a fewer number of ICU beds, and less likely to be teaching hospitals (all p &lt; 0.05). Dual eligibility was independently predictive of receiving care at a low-volume hospitals for esophagectomy ([95% CI 1.15 &ndash; 2.10]), pancreatectomy (1.32 [1.12 &ndash; 1.55]), and rectal surgery (1.49 [1.35 &ndash; 1.66]), but not for aortic valve replacement. The significance of medical and social risk as a predictor of receiving care at low-volume hospitals also differed by surgery. Medically high-risk patients were more likely to be treated at low-volume hospitals for aortic valve replacement (OR 1.29 [1.18 &ndash; 1.40]) and rectal surgery (1.16 [1.01 &ndash; 1.34]), but not for esophagectomy or pancreatectomy. Socially high-risk patients were only more likely to be treated at low-volume hospitals for aortic valve replacement (1.61 [1.51 &ndash; 1.71]).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Medicare beneficiaries who are socially at-risk are more likely to receive complex surgical care at low-volume hospitals, which have previously been shown to have poorer outcomes. Medicare policy promoting the use of high-volume hospitals, especially among those patients with high social risk in addition to high clinical risk, may be an effective means to improve outcomes.

Performing a successful surgery is a complex multidisciplinary process which requires attention to detail from as many as two dozen care teams. Reliable systems require effective communication across all such teams, beginning with the initial request to schedule the surgery. This information is essential for preparing both the patient and the operating room (OR). When information is missing or mistakes are made in this initial workflow step, downstream errors can occur.

With the creation of standardized case request order sets for each surgical service, we hypothesized that we could help improve perioperative communication and efficiency and reduce downstream errors.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We recruited participating surgical service physician leads to help guide development of comprehensive specialty-specific order sets in Epic designed to support requests for the most common procedures. These order sets include structured options for procedure names and descriptions, CPT codes, associated preference cards, OR equipment needs and other associated orders. To help reduce errors and promote efficiency, many of these selections were defaulted to case information at the level of the individual procedure orders.

We measured the adoption rate among surgical specialties, the time spent by surgeons ordering cases (manual time observations), the percent of case request orders containing a primary CPT code, the preference card association accuracy, and operating room efficiency metrics.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

28 division-specific order sets were created for &gt;2,200 procedures, representing over 75% of service lines. There has been a significant increase in the number of case request orders placed that contain a primary CPT code (65% prior to the intervention compared to 95% after). The percentage of cases with an overridden preference card has significantly decreased for our pilot services (Table 1). Twelve surgeons from these pilot services were observed, and their average manual time ordering cases decreased from 2.75 minutes to 25 seconds with the new order sets. There is no evidence at this time that the new case request order sets have significantly affected case delay or on-time starts, however, we are limited in measuring these metrics in this case by our current software systems. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 

Based on the results of this study, we demonstrate the structure and functionality of standardized surgical case request order sets in Epic, highlighting multiple benefits in standardization, efficiency, and satisfaction. These order sets significantly reduce the time to complete a crucial and complex task while improving the accuracy of the process.

We hypothesized similar outcomes by specialty, with greater laparoscopy use by GS and greater thoracic approaches by TS.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All adults undergoing hiatal hernia repair from 2012 to 2019 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Specialty was classified into GS and TS, and approach into laparoscopy, laparotomy, or thoracoscopy/thoracotomy. Indications were categorized into gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus, uncomplicated hernia, or complicated hernia (presence obstruction or ischemia). Generalized linear models, adjusting for patient and operative characteristics, were used to evaluate the effect of specialty on mortality, complications, operative time, length of stay (LOS), and non-elective readmission.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among the 46,739 patients meeting study criteria, 5.0% were operated on by TS. From 2012 to 2019, the proportion of cases performed as an outpatient by GS increased (28.1% to 46.4%, p&lt;0.001), but remained stable for TS (0.1% to 0.7%, p=0.10, Figure 1). Laparoscopic utilization increased for TS (69.6% in 2012 to 86.1% in 2019, p&lt;0.001), but remained lower than GS (92.8% to 96.3%, p&lt;0.001). GS operated on younger patients (44.7 years vs 47.0, p&lt;0.001) with lesser systemic illness (American Society of Anesthesiologists class &ge;3 50.4% vs 54.8%, p&lt;0.001) compared to TS. Relative to TS, GS performed more outpatient cases (39.3% vs 17.5%, p&lt;0.001) and operated more commonly for GERD or Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus (25.1% vs 18.9%) and less for complicated hernias (8.1% vs 10.2%, p&lt;0.001). GS more frequently used laparoscopy (95.0% vs 82.6%) and less commonly used thoracic approaches (0.6% vs 8.5%, p&lt;0.001). After adjustment, neither specialty (TS odds ratio 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.5) nor thoracic approach (1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.4) were associated with mortality, while laparotomy (1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.5) was associated with greater mortality. Operations by TS were not associated with greater complications (0.9, 95% CI 0.8-1.1) or readmission (0.9, 95% CI 0.8-1.1) relative to GS, but had slightly greater operative time (17 minutes, 95% CI 14-20 minutes) but similar LOS.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: GS have adopted outpatient hiatal hernia to a greater degree than TS over time, and more frequently utilized laparoscopic approaches. Operative factors, such as indication, surgical approach, and patient comorbidities more strongly influence outcomes than does surgeon specialty, suggesting continued safety of hiatal hernia repair by both TS and GS.

Unplanned reoperation is associated with postoperative morbidity/mortality and is an increasingly assessed quality of care metric. Accurate preoperative risk prediction of adverse surgical outcomes, such as unplanned reoperation, is an invaluable prognostic tool that (1) supports family/patient counseling and informed consent, surgical/postoperative care planning, and healthcare resource allocation and (2) provides opportunities for improving patient outcomes/satisfaction and healthcare quality/economy. The Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System (SURPAS) is a parsimonious risk assessment tool using 8 preoperative predictor variables developed from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) dataset. SURPAS is applicable to more than 3000 operations in adults in 9 surgical specialties, predicts important adverse outcomes, and is incorporated into the electronic health record. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether the 8-variable SURPAS model could preoperatively predict the risk of postoperative 30-day unplanned reoperation as accurately as a model using all of the 28 preoperative nonlaboratory predictor variables available in the ACS NSQIP dataset.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A &ldquo;full model&rdquo; for risk of postoperative unplanned reoperation was developed from the 28 preoperative nonlaboratory variables in the ACS NSQIP 2012-2018 dataset using logistic regression. This was compared to the 8-variable SURPAS model using (1) C index, a discrimination metric; (2) Hosmer-Lemeshow observed-to-expected plots, a calibration metric; and (3) Brier score (BS), a combined discrimination-calibration metric. Internal chronological validation of the SURPAS model was also conducted, developing the model with the 2012-2017 &ldquo;training&rdquo; dataset and applying the model to the 2018 &ldquo;test&rdquo; dataset.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 5,777,108 patients, 162,387 (2.81%) underwent a 30-day unplanned reoperation. The SURPAS model&rsquo;s C index, 0.748, was 99.20% of that of the full model&rsquo;s (0.754); the Hosmer-Lemeshow plots showed good calibration for both the full model and SURPAS model; and Brier scores were 0.0264 and 0.0265 for the full model and SURPAS model, respectively. The internal chronological validation of the SURPAS model showed similar results (C=0.749, BS=0.0268 for the training dataset and C=0.748, BS=0.0250 for the test dataset).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The 8-variable SURPAS model preoperatively predicts risk of postoperative 30-day unplanned reoperation as accurately as the 28-variable preoperative nonlaboratory ACS NSQIP full model. Therefore, unplanned reoperation can be integrated into the existing SURPAS tool to provide accurate preoperative risk assessment of this important outcome, supporting patient/family counseling and guiding clinical decision-making.

The training providers receive regarding opioid prescribing is variable. Despite the availability of prescribing guidelines, such as the Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network (OPEN), wide variations in prescribing practices persist. This quality improvement (QI) initiative aimed to assess and improve institutional adherence to OPEN guidelines.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This study represents a QI initiative at an academic medical center from July 2019-June 2021. We examined all opioid-na&iuml;ve patients 18 years of age or older undergoing one of twenty reviewed procedures. Data collected included demographics, length of stay (LOS), procedure, surgeon, service, discharge provider, and opioid prescriptions. Opioids prescribed on discharge were evaluated for concordance with recommendations based on OPEN guidelines. The first academic year (pre-intervention) assessed baseline prescribing and local culture and knowledge. The second academic year (post-intervention) assessed prescribing practices after initiative rollout. The initiative targeted a 10% improvement goal and focused on education and monthly feedback reports. Pre- and post-intervention cohorts were compared. A p chart was used to represent data throughout the study period. Variables were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test or Chi-squared test. A backwards stepwise logistic regression model for OPEN guideline concordant discharges was created. A p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 4705 cases were included, 2343 pre-intervention and 2362 post-intervention. Median patient age was 51 years old and 54.8% were female. An opioid prescription was provided to patients 78.0% of the time. There were no significant differences between the pre- and post-intervention cohorts in terms of types of opioid prescribed or procedures performed. The proportion of OPEN guideline concordant discharge prescriptions improved from 50.2% in the pre-intervention cohort to 63.5% in the post-intervention cohort (P&lt;0.001, figure). Adjusted analysis controlling for age, sex, and LOS demonstrated a 77% increase in odds of OPEN guideline concordant discharge in the post-intervention cohort (AOR 1.77; 95%CI=1.58&ndash;1.99).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study represents a successful QI initiative improving guideline concordant opioid discharges and decreasing over-prescribing. These data suggest published guidelines need to be paired with locally targeted clinician education on opioid prescribing and that real-time data driven feedback amplifies impact on prescribing behavior.

However, it is unclear whether complete opioid tapering can be achieved among chronic opioid users (COU) without adversely impacting their pain control and quality of life. This study was designed to assess the association between complete opioid tapering following surgery and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for pain intensity and pain interference with activities of daily living.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified patients with COU undergoing a spectrum of non-emergent orthopedic, vascular, and general surgery procedures at a single VA medical institution between December 2017 and December 2020. All patients were prospectively followed by a transitional pain service (TPS) for 90-days after surgery that promoted opioid tapering as well as assessed opioid use [milligram morphine equivalents (MME)] and PROMs of pain intensity (PROMIS P3A) and pain interference (PROMIS P6B). Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationship between PROMs and MME. Additionally, patients were stratified on whether complete vs. partial/no opioid tapering was achieved after surgery. Changes in PROMs were compared using analysis of variance (2-way ANOVA) and differences in effect size (Cohen&rsquo;s d).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 261 surgical patients (90% male with a mean age of 62.4 +/- 14.4 years) with COU underwent surgery at a VA medical center during the study period, of which 65 (25%) completely tapered off opioids within 60-days after surgery and 196 (75%) partially tapered or did not taper. Overall, there was a positive but low correlation between the change in MME and change in self-reported pain intensity (r=0.25, p&lt;0.001) and pain interference (r=0.27, p&lt;0.001). However, higher correlation coefficients were reported within the first 30-days after discharge. After stratifying based on 60-day cessation status, there was no difference in baseline patient-reported intensity or interference between groups (p=0.32, 0.94 respectively). However, patients who completely tapered had significant improvement in the change in PROMS for pain intensity and interference (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05, Figure A &amp; B) with the most significant effect size at 30-days after discharge or both pain intensity and interference (Cohen&rsquo;s d, 0.41 and 0.59, respectively).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Complete opioid tapering can be successfully achieved following surgery among patients with COU without adversely impacting self-reported pain intensity or pain interference. Our results suggest that the highest potential for improving these PROMs with opioid tapering occurs within the first 30-days after discharge.

Failure to rescue (avoid death after complications) has been proposed as a measure of hospital quality. Although surviving complications is important, not all rescues are created equal. Patients also place considerable value on being able to return home after surgery and resume their normal lives. From a systems standpoint, non-home discharge to skilled nursing and other facilities is the biggest driver of Medicare costs. We wanted to determine whether hospitals&rsquo; ability to keep patients alive after complications was associated with higher rates of home discharge. We hypothesized that hospitals with higher rescue rates would also be more likely to discharge patients home after surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. We included 1,357,809 patients &ge; 18 years old who had elective major surgery (general, vascular, orthopedic) at 3,818 hospitals from 2013-2017. We estimated the correlation between a hospital&rsquo;s performance (rank) on failure to rescue and its rank in terms of home discharge rate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The cohort had a median age of 66 years (IQR 58-73) and 77.9% of patients were Caucasian. Most patients (63.6%) were treated at urban teaching institutions. The surgical case mix included patients having colorectal (146,993 patients; 10.8%), pulmonary (52,334; 3.9%), pancreatic (13,635; 1.0%), hepatic (14,821; 1.1%), gastric (9,182; 0.7%), esophageal (4,494; 0.3%), peripheral vascular bypass (29,196; 2.2%), abdominal aneurysm repair (14,327; 1.1%), coronary artery bypass (61,976; 4.6%), hip replacement (356,400; 26.2%), and knee replacement (654,857; 48.2%) operations. The overall mortality was 0.3%, the average hospital complication rate was 15.9%, the median hospital rescue rate was 99% (IQR 70%-100%), and the median hospital rate of home discharge was 80% (IQR 74%-85%).

There was no significant correlation between hospitals&rsquo; performance on the failure to rescue metric and the likelihood of home discharge after surgery (r = -0.0071; p = 0.66). Even when considering hospital rates of discharge to home following a postoperative complication, there was no correlation between rescue rates and probability of home discharge (r = 0.0183; p = 0.26).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We found no clear relationship between a hospital&rsquo;s ability to avoid mortality after complications and its likelihood of discharging patients home after surgery. Our findings suggest that programs designed to reduce failure to rescue will have little impact on rates of home discharge after surgery. Additional steps need to be taken to help hospitals increase the likelihood that their patients can return home after surgery.

Overlapping surgery (OS) is defined as one attending physician supervising two or more operative cases simultaneously, without the critical portions of the cases occurring concurrently. To date, no study has examined the relationship of percent overlap, or the percentage of one case that is spent overlapping with another, to outcomes, efficiency, safety, and complications. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship of percentage of surgical overlap with perioperative and postoperative outcomes in order to determine if there is a detrimental level of overlap.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This study is a retrospective cohort study conducted at a large tertiary referral center in the Southeastern United States. The primary outcomes of interest included operative duration, in-hospital mortality, 30-day readmission, and patient safety indicators (PSIs) as identified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to evaluate the association between percent overlap and outcomes of interest. P-values of &le;0.05 were considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 87,426 cases were included in this study. There were 62,332 cases (71.3%) without overlap (Group 0), 10,514 cases (12.0%) with 1-25% overlap (Group 1), 5,303 cases (6.1%) with 26-50% overlap (Group 2), 4,296 cases (4.9%) with 51-75% overlap (Group 3), and 4,981 cases (5.7%) with &gt;75% overlap (Group 4). In-hospital mortality decreased as overlap increased with in-hospital mortality rates of 1.73%, 0.97%, 1.25% 1.17% and 0.71% in Groups 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively (p<sub>trend</sub>&lt;0.0001). Operative time increased with increasing overlap with mean times of 1.25 hours, 1.80 hours, 2.09 hours, 2.37 hours, and 2.49 hours in Groups 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (p<sub>trend</sub>&lt; 0.0001). Readmission rates showed no statistical significance between groups with readmission rates of 7.77%, 7.16%, 7.51%, 7.29% and 7.97% for Groups 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (p<sub>trend</sub>&lt; 0.0001). Rates of patient safety indicators were lower for Groups 1, 2 and 3 (1.69%, 2.01% and 2.08%) when compared to Group 0 (2.24%). Group 4 had the highest rate of patient safety indicatorss at 2.35% (p=0.0086). Of the PSIs studied, only iatrogenic pneumothorax (p<sub>trend</sub>=0.0430) and postoperative sepsis (p<sub>trend</sub>=0.0110) showed a statistically significant relationship to percent of overlap while no relationship was found for other PSIs.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 

This study provided insight into how the percentage of overlap does not significantly affect surgical outcomes. Overlapping surgery was shown to have reduced in-hospital mortality and similar patient safety indicator and readmission rates when compared to non-overlapping cases. Operative time was shown to increase in overlapping surgeries when compared to non-overlapping surgeries. The results from this study indicate that the percentage of overlap that occurs between cases does not detrimentally affect most patient outcomes, especially with overlap of less than 75%.

Emergency Department aortic occlusion using either resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) or resuscitative thoracotomy for trauma and hemorrhagic shock are poor, leading some to question the utility of these strategies. This report summarizes patient outcomes over a four-year period following REBOA vs resuscitative thoracotomy at a single, level 1 trauma center with hybrid room capabilities. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This retrospective cohort analysis compared patients who underwent zone 1 aortic occlusion via resuscitative thoracotomy (n=13) vs. REBOA (n=13) for blunt or non-thoracic, penetrating trauma and refractory hemorrhagic shock (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg despite volume resuscitation) at a level 1 trauma center with a dedicated, trauma hybrid operating room. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. The secondary outcome was neurologic status at hospital discharge, assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores. Variables were compared using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis or Fischer Exact testing. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

Overall median age was 40 years, 27% had penetrating injuries, and 23% had pre-hospital, closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In both cohorts, median Injury Severity Scores and head Abbreviated Injury Scores were 26 and 2, respectively. The resuscitative thoracotomy cohort had lower systolic blood pressure on arrival (0 [0-75] vs. 76 [65-99], p=0.009). Hemorrhage control (systolic blood pressure 100 mmHg without ongoing vasopressor or transfusion requirements) was obtained in 77% of all REBOA cases and 8% of all resuscitative thoracotomy cases (p=0.001). Survival to hospital discharge was greater in the REBOA cohort (54% vs. 8%, p=0.030), as was discharge with GCS 15 (46% vs. 0%, p=0.015). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

Among patients undergoing aortic occlusion for blunt or non-thoracic, penetrating trauma and refractory hemorrhagic shock at a center with a dedicated, trauma hybrid operating room, nearly half of all patients managed with REBOA had neurologically intact survival. Patients undergoing resuscitative thoracotomy had greater severity of shock on arrival, thus limiting comparisons between the two modalities.

Our study aims to determine whether the benefit of tracheostomy extends to COVID-19 patients as well. At this time, there is a paucity of literature on optimal timing for tracheostomy creation in patients with COVD-19. This study aims to determine whether early or late tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 was associated with lower inpatient mortality. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A multi-institutional retrospective cohort study was performed. Patients with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 from January 2020 to September 2020 were selected. 93,918 cases were identified. Patients who did not undergo intubation or tracheostomy, underwent tracheostomy prior to intubation, patients &lt;18 years old, hospice patients and those with bacterial pneumonia were excluded. Once the exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 5,911 patients were identified. Comparisons were made between those who underwent endotracheal intubation only vs those who underwent tracheostomy. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality and secondary outcomes included ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral infarct (CVA), acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hospital disposition, hospital length of stay (LOS), total mechanical ventilator days after initial intubation, and additional mechanical ventilator days after tracheostomy. Additional subgroup analysis was done to compare early tracheostomy (&lt;10 days) vs late tracheostomy (&gt;10 days) vs those who had been intubated without tracheostomy creation. Further subgroup analysis was performed to compare days 0-2, 3-6, 7-10, 11-14, 15-18, 19-22, 23+ of tracheostomy. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall inpatient mortality rate was 37.5% in the tracheostomy group compared to 54.4% in intubation only group (p-value &lt;0.0001). Overall, the tracheostomy group was more likely to be discharged to a long term acute care hospital (33.9 % vs 3.8%, p-value 0.0001). The tracheostomy group had a longer mean hospital length of stay (35.8 vs 16.4 days, p-value &lt;0.0001), higher mean total days on mechanical ventilation (21.6 vs 7.4, p-value &lt;0.0001), higher rates of VAP 9.9% vs. 1.9%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.75, 8.26, p-value &lt;0.0001, PE 5.3% vs. 3.2% (aOR 1.83, CI 1.14, 2.92, p-value 0.01), AKI 72.4% vs 67.0% (aOR 1.36, CI 1.08, 1.84, p-value 0.01), and ARDS 19.0% vs 13.8% (aOR 1.41, CI 1.08-1.84, p-value 0.01). Early tracheostomy group had inpatient mortality rate of 44.7% (aOR 0.73, CI 0.52, 1.01) compared to 33.1% (aOR 0.44, CI 0.34, 0.58) in late tracheostomy group.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Out of our 5,516 COVID-19 patients requiring endotracheal intubation, there was a 54.4% inpatient mortality rate. This study suggests overall lower mortality rates in critically ill COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy compared to endotracheal intubation only, and even lower mortality in the late tracheostomy group.

Often, patients with IFF are admitted to the hospital and spend several hours to days awaiting specialist consultation, only to be recommended outpatient follow-up. Our goal was to assess the hospital charges associated with this diagnosis. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a population-based retrospective study using hospital-level discharge data from the Agency for Healthcare Administration (AHCA) from the State of Florida (October 2015 to June 2020). Fractures were divided into categories based on anatomy as defined by ICD-10 codes. Outcomes included hospital charges, hospital length of stay, percentage of patients requiring surgical intervention, inpatient mortality. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During a period of 4.75 years, 4,128 with isolated facial fractures were admitted to Florida trauma centers (TC). In total, this amounted to 12,124 hospital days and $270,595,822 hospital charges. Most patients, 65.7%, underwent operative intervention. Interestingly, patients with isolated facial fractures, who had no other comorbidities, no other injuries, and did not require surgical intervention, on average spent 3.47 days in the hospital. For each of these patients, on average, the hospital charges were $50,278.30. In-hospital mortality of those who had no surgical intervention was greater than those who did undergo surgery (0.6% vs 0.1%; p-value 0.003). The most likely fracture to have operative interventions were Malar (100%) and Mandible (85%). Patients treated at level 1 or 2 TC were more likely to have surgery compared to non-trauma centers (NTC) 75.6% vs. 64.4% vs. 54.2%; p-value 0.0001. NTC had higher mortality at 0.6%, while level 1 and 2 had the same mortality rate at 0.2% p- value 0.13. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: IFFs represent a significant charge burden to the trauma patient. For those who required operative intervention, these were relegated to a few types of fractures. Protocols can be designed to determine which patients need hospital admission to limit charges to patients. Patients with complex IFF should be referred to the nearest trauma center since NTC performed fewer operations and had higher mortality. Further studies and interventions must address how to decrease the hospital length of stay for patients with IFF who have no other injuries or comorbidities.

Smith<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Florida, Surgery, Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Greater than 1/3 of all trauma-related deaths are secondary to exsanguinating hemorrhage. Hybrid operating rooms (OR) offer near simultaneous endovascular and open techniques and have been associated with earlier hemorrhage control, fewer transfusion requirements, and decreased mortality. However, rising healthcare costs mandate value assessments. This study describes the cost-utility of a dedicated trauma hybrid operating room. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This is a retrospective cohort study of 292 consecutive adult trauma patients who underwent immediate (&lt; 4 hours) operative intervention at a Level 1 Trauma Center. 106 patients treated prior to the construction of the hybrid OR in 2016 served as controls to 186 patients treated thereafter. Data representing patient demographics, hemorrhage control procedures, raw financial data, and postoperative complications and outcomes were collected. Value (outcomes achieved per dollar spent) and incremental cost-utility ratio were calculated. Comparisons were made using Fisher&rsquo;s Exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Hybrid OR construction cost was 1.6 million USD. Between the two consecutive cohorts, there were no differences in blunt vs penetrating trauma, Glasgow Coma Scale, systolic blood pressure, Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma findings, or lactic acid levels. Rates of open operative and angiographic techniques did not differ. There were equal rates of hemorrhagic control (95% vs 96%, p = 0.78, control vs hybrid OR), though time to hemorrhage control (60 vs 49 min, p = 0.005) and 4-24hr transfusion requirements (1 vs 0 units, p &lt; 0.001) were less in the hybrid OR group. Postoperative infectious complications were less compared to the control (27% vs 15%, p = 0.009), driven largely by decrease in pneumonia. Overall complications, length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, and discharge disposition did not differ between the cohorts. Professional (33.2k vs 46.1k USD, p = 0.02), total charges (166.7k vs 202.6k, p = 0.05), and total costs (45.3 vs 52.4, p = 0. 255) were not significantly different. Incremental utility in median grade of Clavien-Dindo Grade &ge; 3 was -0.05. The value of a hybrid OR was equivalent to that of the control. Approximately $5,200 was spent per patient per one-point associated decrease in complication grade.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The introduction of a dedicated trauma hybrid OR resulted in decreased time to hemorrhagic control, 4-24h transfusion requirements, and postoperative infections, which were associated with a non-significant increase in total charges, professional charges, and total costs, conferring equal overall value. Research into the utility, cost-effectiveness, and tangential benefits of a dedicated hybrid OR are ongoing.

Bonne<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Hospital, Trauma And Critical Care, Newark, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The straight leg raise maneuver is an accepted and highly sensitive test for sciatic nerve radiculopathy. Recent studies have suggested that this maneuver can also be sensitive and specific for diagnosis of clinically significant vertebral fractures. An active straight leg raise is a weight bearing test which assesses pain upon movement and a patient&rsquo;s ability to load their pelvis, lumbar, and thoracic spine. As many hemodynamically stable patients undergo CT scanning solely for spinal tenderness, we sought to determine whether stable patients who can perform active straight leg raising effectively rule out lumbar and thoracic vertebral fractures in blunt trauma and avoid CT scan in this cohort.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Blunt trauma patients presenting to a high volume, Level 1, urban trauma center from 2019-2021, 18 and older with GCS 15 presenting in hemodynamically stable condition with significant blunt truncal trauma were screened. Patients underwent standard trauma resuscitation and workup, including CT scan. The research team then inquired to the clinical team if the patient had identified pelvic or lower extremity fractures, but remained blinded to the presence of spinal column fractures. Patients with pelvic and lower extremity fractures were excluded. Patients were asked to raise each leg separately with a straightened knee to 12, 18, and 24 inches above the bed while lying flat. The patient&rsquo;s ability to raise the leg as well as baseline pain, and pain at each level were assessed using a pain numerical rating scale. The clinical examination results were then matched post hoc with the official radiology reports.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
90 patients were screened, 58 males and 32 females. Spinal fractures were present in 14/90 patients (15.5%). 71 patients had baseline pain. Injury mechanisms included motor vehicle collision (50%), pedestrian struck (28%), fall from height (20%), assault with blunt weapon (2%). 36 patients performed a full straight leg raise with no change to baseline level of pain. A &ldquo;positive test&rdquo; was identified as any patient who could not perform the raise of both legs to the specified height. Of the 76 patients without fractures: 21 patients had a positive test at 12 inches, 29 patients at 18 inches, and 37 at 24 inches. Of the 14 patients with identified fractures, 3 had a positive test at 12 inches, 6 at 18 inches, and 6 at 24 inches. Positive predictive value was 16% and negative predictive value was 85%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Although straight leg raise has been discussed as a useful adjunct to physical exam in blunt trauma, its positive and more importantly negative predictive value are insufficient to rule out clinically significant spinal column fractures. Straight leg cannot be used as a discriminator to reduce CT scanning. Liberal indications for CT based upon mechanism and especially pain and tenderness are necessary to identify thoraco-lumbar spine fractures.

Sribnick<sup>1</sup>, R. Thakkar<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health burden in children, causing thousands of deaths each year. Predictive scales have been used to prognosticate long-term outcomes of TBI, but gaps remain in predicting mortality using initial trauma resuscitation data. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of clinical variables collected during initial resuscitation of intubated pediatric TBI patients in the trauma bay on mortality. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Intubated pediatric trauma patients 0-18 years old with TBI from January 2011-December 2020 were included and descriptive statistics were performed. Association between clinical variables collected during initial trauma resuscitation (temperature, pulse, mean arterial blood pressure [MAP], Glasgow coma scale [GCS], hemoglobin, international [INR], platelets, and oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide [ETCO2]) and mortality were evaluated with multivariable logistic regression. Dominance analysis was used to determine the importance of each variables&rsquo; correlation with mortality and reported with mean conditional weight measures of variables.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our cohort consisted of 498 patients with a mean age of 7.1 years (SD: 5.6). The majority of patients were male (66.0%) and white (68.0%). Overall mean GCS was 5 (SD:6), head abbreviated injury score (hAIS) was 4 (SD: 2), and injury severity score (ISS) was 21.0 (SD: 13.8). Over the 10-year study period, the incidence of mortality was 20.0%. The multivariable regression model determined that INR, temperature, and GCS were significantly associated (p&lt;0.05) with mortality, and thus, strong predictors. The impact of each clinical variable correlating with mortality (and corresponding mean conditional measure) in descending order was: INR (0.18), GCS (0.13), temperature (0.08), MAP (0.02), platelets (0.02), SpO2 (0.02), ETCO2 (0.02), hemoglobin (0.01), and pulse (0.01) ( Figure 1). Temperature and GCS were inversely correlated with mortality, with each increase in unit (degree Fahrenheit or &ldquo;1&rdquo; on the scale) being associated with a 22% and 32% decreased risk of mortality, respectively. INR directly correlated with mortality, and with each increase in unit (1.0), the risk of mortality increased by a factor of 17.4 (95% CI: 7.1-47.9).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pediatric patients with severe TBI requiring intubation are at substantial risk for mortality. These data suggest that INR, GCS and temperature are significantly correlated with mortality. Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate whether aggressive interventions targeting these variables during initial trauma resuscitation impact a patient&rsquo;s risk of death.

This study is a secondary analysis of the Randomized Transfusion Requirement in Burn Care Evaluation (TRIBE) data set that seeks to investigate the impact of obesity on mortality and related outcomes following acute burn injury. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Body Mass Index (BMI) was used to stratify TRIBE patients as Normal Weight (NW; BMI 18.5-25), All Obese (AO; Any patient with BMI&gt;30), Obese I (OI; BMI 30-34.9), Obese II (OII; BMI 35-39.9), or Obese III (OIII; BMI&gt;40). Primary outcomes were mortality and survival. Secondary outcomes included infections, length of stay, organ dysfunction, and wound healing. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for bivariate analysis of continuous variables. Fisher&rsquo;s exact test or &chi;<sup>2</sup> test was used for categorical variables. The ability of variables to predict mortality was determined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Log-rank analysis was used for Kaplan-Meier survival curves. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 335 patients included for study, 130 were obese. Median TBSA was 31%, inhalation injury was present in 23% of patients, and 12% of patients died. Inhalation injury was more prevalent in OIII than NW (42.11% vs 20%, p&lt;0.05). Total Blood Stream Infections (BSI) and incidence were higher in AO (p&lt;0.05) and OI (p&lt;0.01) compared to NW. OIII had significantly more operations (4 vs 2, p&lt;0.05), ventilator days (25 vs 6, p&lt;0.05), days to wound healing (41.5 vs 22, p&lt;0.05), and worse organ dysfunction (admission MOD: 6 vs 4, p&lt;0.05; maximum MOD: 10 vs 7, p&lt;0.05) than NW. Mortality was not significantly different between AO (12.31%, p=0.98), OI (10.84%, p=0.75), OII (17.9%, p=0.38), or OIII (10.53%, p&gt;0.99) compared to NW (12.2%). Kaplan-Meyer survival curves did not significantly differ between the groups (&chi;<sup>2</sup>= 0.025, p=0.87). Multiple logistic regression identified Age, TBSA, and %Full Thickness burn as independent predictors (p&lt;0.05) of mortality regardless of BMI classification, but BMI classification itself was not predictive of mortality.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Mortality and survival after burn injury were not significantly affected by obesity. Age, TBSA, and %Full Thickness burn are independent predictors of mortality after burn injury, while BMI classification is not. Despite this, operations, ventilator days and BSIs were all significantly increased in higher obesity classifications. Obese patients also had more severe organ dysfunction and increased wound healing time. Further study will be required to better elucidate these findings and help pave the way for better patient care.

Ho<sup>1</sup>, J. Claridge<sup>1</sup>, L. R. Brown<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>MetroHealth Medical Center, Trauma, Critical Care And Acute Care Surgery, Cleveland, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Measuring the endpoint of resuscitation in hypovolemia remains a holy grail of surgical critical care, and no single technique has proven superior. Our study compared clinical hypovolemia (CH) with 3 diagnostic adjuncts: 1) noninvasive cardiac monitoring (NICOM), 2) ultrasound (US) static IVC collapsibility (US-IVC), and 3) US dynamic carotid velocity (US-C). We hypothesized US measures would correlate more closely to CH than NICOM.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Adult trauma/surgical ICU patients were prospectively enrolled using common clinical criteria for suspected hypovolemia after acute resuscitation including tachycardia, vasopressor requirement, and low urine output (10/2020-5/2021), and excluding burns, known heart failure or severe liver/kidney disease. CH was established by attending documentation or administration of fluid/blood bolus. Adjunct measurements were assessed up to twice a day until clinical improvement, for a maximum of 48 hours. Hypovolemia for the adjunct techniques was defined as: 1) NICOM: &ge;10% stroke volume variation with passive leg raise (PLR), 2) US-IVC: &lt;2.1cm and 50% collapsibility (non-ventilated) or &lt;18% collapsibility (ventilated), 3) US-C: peak systolic velocity increase 15 cm/s with PLR. Previously unknown cardiac dysfunction seen on US was noted. Observation-level data were analyzed with a Cohen&#39;s kappa (&kappa;).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

45 patients (62% male, median age 60) yielded 65 measures. 58 (89%) had CH. 26/54 (48%) were hypovolemic by NICOM, 18/48 (38%) by US-IVC, and 6/56 (11%) by US-C. Agreement with CH was 47% for NICOM, 37% for US-IVC and 12% for US-C. None of the three adjuncts correlated with CH (&kappa; -0.045 to -0.005). Previously unknown cardiac dysfunction was present in 12 patients. Even after removal of patients with cardiac dysfunction, no adjuncts correlated with CH (&kappa; -0.038 to 0.006). In addition, no technique correlated with any other ( &kappa; -0.117 to 0.119, Table).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

None of the adjunct hypovolemia measures correlated with clinical hypovolemia or each other, highlighting that fluid status remains one of the most challenging aspects of critical care. In patients suspected to be hypovolemic, a quarter of the patients who had no prior heart disease demonstrated cardiac dysfunction on ultrasound, illustrating its importance in the assessment of volume status in otherwise healthy patients.

Over the last 30 years, the United States has seen a continuous rise in obesity. Stratified by body mass index (BMI), we have seen negative effects of obesity throughout medicine. One segment of the population, the super morbidly obese (BMI &gt; 60), has contributed to this rise yet has been understudied. In 2020 we presented data from a 5-year period at a single trauma center which showed an increase in mean hospital length of stay, percent of patients requiring ICU admission, percent of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, mean ICU length of stay, any complication and mortality rate. We postulated that super morbidly obese patients would require additional resources as an inpatient and would require more intensive discharge disposition (e.g. SNF vs. rehab vs. home health). This study aimed to quantify the impact a BMI &gt; 50 had on these resources in trauma patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This retrospective database study gathered data from all trauma activations at a single institution over a 5-year period to analyze the differences in outcomes for 6 specific healthcare outcomes compared between super morbidly obese and propensity score matched non-obese patients. Subjects were matched on age, sex, mechanism of injury, ISS, AIS, and then stratified by BMI.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

This study evaluated 57 supermorbid obese subjects and 95 non obese. The average number of physical therapy (PT) visits (3.1 vs. 1.6, p = 0.0039), average number of occupational therapy (OT) visits (2.5 vs. 1.2, p = 0.005), total PT minutes (189 vs. 44.8, p = 0.0018), and total OT minutes (88.2 vs. 33.2, p = 0.0029) were all found to be statistically significant. Meanwhile, there was no statistical significance in full weight bearing status at discharge (16/55 for BMI &gt; 60 vs. 30/93 for BMI &lt; 60, p = 0.1623), discharge without assist devices (26/55 for BMI &gt; 60 vs. 55/95 for BMI &lt; 60, p = 0.1753), and discharge destination (home vs. rehabilitation vs. nursing facility).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

With increasing rates of obesity in the United States there will be an increasing emphasis on treatment of patients with obesity and obesity related complications. This becomes more important in the era of managed care and bundled billing for healthcare systems. Our study shows that patients with super morbid obesity require more frequent and prolonged therapy services during their admission as well as specific therapy equipment on discharge from the hospital, leading to increased healthcare spending and overall cost of admission.

In addition, management of TBI patients after head surgery is debatable. The aim was to compare injury characteristics, surgical interventions, and outcomes between GP (&ge;65 y.o.) and non-geriatric patients (NGP) with TBI after head surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This Institutional Review Board approved, retrospective cohort study included 353 patients with blunt TBI from two level 1 Trauma Centers who underwent an emergency head procedure (craniotomy, craniectomy, burr hole) and had postoperative head computed tomography (CT) within 24 hours. GP (n=179) and NGP (n=174) were compared for: comorbidities, mechanism of injury (MOI), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Marshall Score, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, CT findings and timing, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (ICULOS, HLOS), hospital discharge disposition and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: GP were significantly older than NGP (80 vs 44), with higher rate of comorbidities (87% vs 48%) and pre-injury anticoagulation use (55% vs 6%), all p&lt;0.001. Predominant MOI in GP was falls and it was significantly more common than in NGP (93% vs 48%, p&lt;0.001). Mean ISS was the same in both groups (25 vs 25), but GCS was statistically higher in GP (12 vs 10, p&lt;0.001). There was no difference between groups in Marshall scores (3.3 vs 3.2), or pre-surgery ASA scores (3.6 vs 3.6), both p&gt;0.3.

Subdural hematomas were more common among GP (79% vs 59%), and craniotomies were performed most as first brain surgery (89% vs 70%, p&lt;0.001). Average time from admission to first brain surgery was not statistically different (22 vs 17 hours, p=0.1). Average time from brain surgery to first postoperative CT was significantly shorter for GP (3 vs 8 hours, p&lt;0.001). However, the occurrence of negative dynamic on early CT was not different (42% vs 36%, p=0.2). GP had second head surgery less often with more surgical candidates considered nonsurvivable than NGP (26% vs 47%, p=0.02). GP had significantly shorter ICULOS and HLOS (7 vs 9 days and 10 vs 24 days, p&lt;0.004), were more often discharged to hospice (24% vs 5%), and skilled nursing/rehabilitation (62% vs 43%), but less likely to home (8% vs 39%).Fig.1. Overall in-hospital and hospice mortality was significantly higher in GP than in NGP (31% vs 18%, p=0.007).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Geriatric patients sustained less severe TBI and from lower energy trauma than NGP, however, curative treatment was applied less often than in younger patients, and they were more likely to be discharged to hospice due to more comorbidities and advanced care directives.

Recovery centers are introduced to patients&rsquo; families as referrals from urban based hospitals. Medicare reports 69% of rural patients are displaced for post-acute care but displacement specifics for trauma patients is unknown. We hypothesized rural trauma patient recovery will disproportionately displace patients from their support network.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Appalachian Research Consortium is a multi-institutional group of four level 1 trauma centers who retrospectively evaluated all transferred trauma patients from 1/1/2018-12/31/2019. Patients were considered displaced if their post-acute care facility zip code differed from their home zip code. Wilcoxon tests, two-sample t-test and chi-squared tests (with odds ratios) were used for assessment of displacement factors. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall 34.2% (n=385) were displaced for post-acute care recovery. Displaced patients were younger (66.5 y/o vs 72.0; p &lt;0.0001), more injured (ISS 15.2 vs 12; p&lt;0.0001) and had higher chest abbreviated injury scale (AIS) (2.1 vs 1.6 p=0.002) (Table 1). Variables associated with displacement included: sepsis (OR: 6.4, 95% CI 2.3-17.5; p&lt;0.0001), non-private insurance (OR 5.4, 95% CI 4.1-7.0; p&lt;0.0001), operative intervention (OR 1.8, 95% CI1.4-2.3; p &lt;0.0001) and hypotension on arrival (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.8; p&lt;0.0009) (Figure 1).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Rural trauma patients were more likely to be displaced from their support network during recovery if they had higher ISS, were physiologically unstable on admission and suffered hospital complications. Recognition of these factors during acute care of trauma patients can assist trauma teams to anticipate the needs of patients for recovery.

Pakistan has an underdeveloped hospital network serving a population of over 220 million, the critical care capacities of which have been overwhelmed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to conduct the first geospatial mapping study that profiles national critical care accessibility. The multipronged mandate of this study is to create a robust understanding of existing infrastructure and accessibility to critical care facilities, highlight gaps and inform critical care health sector planning. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Geographic information systems (GIS) mapping has been used to visualize and plot critical care institutions across Pakistan. Data sources included four arms: 1. Government provided hospital lists; 2. Population-based data from the Country Specific Worldpop 2020 dataset; 3. Travel time using the O-D time cost matrix based on the road network analysis in ESRI ArcMap 10.2.2 and 4. Road network of Pakistan, extracted from Open Street Map and Google Maps. Travel time from each 1x1 km population point to facility was interpolated to create the travel-time surface map. Furthermore, Accessibility Index (AI) scores were calculated using the Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area Algorithm (E2SFCA). We determined AI by combining GIS to a measurement of vehicle accessibility and facility size. Greater AI scores equated to better access, with scores ranging from 0 &ndash; 9.82. Getis-Ord Gi* analysis was used to identify statistically significant hot and cold spots based on clustering of AI.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We used data from 143 facilities. 84% (range: 7.9%-100%) of the population lived within an hour of a basic critical care facility per the travel-time method. 19% (range: 0.04%-90.15%) of the population had poor accessibility scores, of less than 1.5 [see Figure 1]. Hot spot analysis showed only two clusters nationwide with more than sufficient accessibility. 35% of the total population classified as cold spots &ndash; statistically significant spatial clusters lacking desired access. Further analysis highlighted clear provincial disparity, with the entire Federal Capital having access while only 13.8% of Gilgit-Baltistan had access to critical care services. Those living in underdeveloped provincial regions proved to be the most adversely affected, with high travel times to nearest critical care centers. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study highlights that there is a stark inequity between provinces and many areas in the country lack significant critical care access. Given Pakistan&rsquo;s decentralized healthcare system, analysis like ours will be pivotal to guide policy makers in determining investments to enhance accessibility using an evidence-based approach.

Traditionally, these fractures have been treated conservatively with closed reduction and immobilization. Recently, open reduction and internal fixation has been increasingly used to address DRF. This study compares annual trends, patient outcomes, and hospital costs between geriatric patients with DRF who underwent operative versus non-operative management.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was queried from 2012 to 2015. Geriatric patients (&gt;65 years of age) with DRF who underwent operative or non-operative management were identified using ICD-9 diagnosis and procedure codes. Patients with serious injury to any other body region, defined as an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score greater than 2, were excluded from this study. Demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as outcome measures were reported. x<sup>2</sup>- and Student&rsquo;s t-tests were used for univariate survey-adjusted comparisons between operative and non-operative groups. Multivariate survey-adjusted linear regressions were used to identify associations between surgical intervention and length of stay (LOS) and cost of hospitalization, respectively. Analyses were conducted using RStudio (version 1.4.1717) and the R &ldquo;survey&rdquo; package (version 4.1-1).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 44,900 patients met inclusion criteria; 28,230 underwent operative management while 16,670 did not. The operative group was younger (77.9 vs 81.0, p&lt;0.001), included more females (87.5% vs 82.3%, p&lt;0.001), and more patients with private insurance (7.7% vs 5.8%, p&lt;0.001). The operative group had shorter LOS (3.4 vs 4.8, p&lt;0.001) with more patients discharged to home/self-care (45% vs 26.1%, p&lt;0.001); they also had lower Elixhauser Comorbidity Index Scores for 30-day readmission (11.16 vs 16.48, p&lt;0.001) and in-hospital mortality (3.57 vs 6.47, p&lt;0.001). Median cost of hospitalization was higher for the operative group ($9,622 vs $6,570, p&lt;0.001). Multivariable analyses demonstrated that surgical intervention was associated with a decrease of 1.39 days in LOS (95% CI, 1.20-1.57, p&lt;0.001) and an increase of $2,298 in cost of hospitalization (95% CI $1,932-$2,664; p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Operative management of DRF in the geriatric population is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a greater likelihood to be discharged home. Conversely, non-operative management is associated with an average decrease in hospital cost of approximately $2,300. Discharges to nursing facilities may quickly offset this cost difference and merits investigation. Further study is needed to evaluate the factors contributing to more rapid discharge home in this geriatric trauma population.

Beal<sup>1</sup>, A. Littlefield<sup>1</sup>, S. Galandiuk<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Price Institute of Surgical Research, Colorectal Surgery, Louisville, KENTUCKY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. and cases of early-onset (EOCRC) have increased remarkably in young (&lt;50 years), often obese people over the last 20 years. Obesity is accompanied by altered levels of hormones produced by adipose tissue, such as adiponectin and leptin. These hormones can affect cytokine expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME), and thus mediate inflammation during cancer progression.

Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific protein that exerts various anti-inflammatory effects. While systemic adiponectin levels are low in obese individuals, levels of the proinflammatory adipokine leptin are elevated. Both hormones affect cellular cytokine expression within the TME and therefore mediate carcinogenic effects. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&alpha;), C-C motif chemokine ligand 22 (CCL22) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression are associated with cancer progression in CRC. This study&#39;s aim was to investigate carcinogenic cytokine expression in human colon cancer cells following leptin and adiponectin treatment.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells were seeded into 24-well plates, followed by a 24-hour resting period in medium. Cells were then incubated with either leptin or adiponectin for 3, 6, 18 or 24 hours. After mRNA extraction, TaqMan qRT-PCR was performed. Normalized cytokine expression values were compaired against a negative control of untreated cells, Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Student&rsquo;s t-test.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Significant changes in cytokine expression after the respective cell treatment are demonstrated in Table 1. After adiponectin treatment, an increase in CCL22 expression was exhibited at 3 hours (32-fold, p=0.006) and at 6 hours (81-fold, p=0.032). Leptin treatment induced upregulation of proinflammatory TNF-&alpha; with a maximum effect after 6 hours (9-fold, p=0.003). Furthermore, anti-inflammatory IL-8 expression was upregulated after leptin treatment, with a maximum significant effect after 18 hours (6-fold, p=&lt;0.001). Other cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-10, IL-1&beta;, ACOD-1, and cancer-related transcription factor expression of PPAR-&gamma; and NF-&kappa;B, showed no significant changes.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Obesity-related hormones affect colon cancer cell cytokine expression, thereby mediating tumor promoting effects. Adiponectin upregulates CCL22 gene expression, which is associated with worse outcome in CRC. Leptin treatment promotes TNF-&alpha; and IL-8 gene expression, which is associated with advanced tumor stage and progression in CRC. This suggests that obesity-related hormones regulate inflammatory mechanisms within the TME, which may be a link between obesity and EOCRC progression.

Carchman<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin, Department Of Surgery, Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The incidence of anal cancer continues to rise in the United States. Most anal cancers are associated with HPV infection which results in subsequent dysplasia or growth of abnormal cells. There have not been significant advances in anal dysplasia treatments in decades. Current treatments are non-specific and not molecularly targeted, thus are poorly-tolerated with high recurrence rates. Our lab has previously shown that topical application of a dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor can prevent anal cancer development in an HPV-associated mouse model of anal carcinogenesis. The goal of this study is to determine if single pathway inhibition alone can prevent the progression of high-grade anal dysplasia to anal cancer in HPV transgenic mice.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: K14-E6/E7 transgenic mice, that express HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 in their epithelium, were randomized into six treatment groups and treated topically at the anus. These groups included a control (no treatment), 7, 12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) only, Pictilisib (0.5%); a PI3K inhibitor, with and without DMBA, and Sapanisertib (1%); an mTOR inhibitor, with and without DMBA. DMBA was utilized because this carcinogen ensures the progression of dysplasia to cancer within 20 weeks. Mice began treatment at 25 weeks, the age at which the majority of mice develop high-grade dysplasia spontaneously, and were treated for 20 weeks. Mice anuses were harvested for histologic evaluation and immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate PI3K (pAKT) and mTOR (pS6) activity. Tissue analysis was completed using ImageJ and treatment groups were compared via one-way ANOVA.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: All of the Pictilisib only and Sapanisertib only mice remained anal cancer free. Only one control mouse developed anal cancer while 83% (25/30) of DMBA only mice progressed to anal cancer. Additionally, 93% of mice treated with Pictilisib+DMBA (26/28) and 94% of mice treated with Sapanisertib+DMBA (29/31) developed anal cancer. Mice tissues showed a significant decrease in pAKT expression when treated with Sapanisertib alone compared to control and Sapanisertib+DMBA groups (p-values &lt; 0.05). Mice tissues also showed a significant decrease in pS6 expression when treated with Sapanisertib alone compared to control group, DMBA only, and Sapanisertib+DMBA group (p-values &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in pAKT or pS6 expression associated with Pictilisib.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Single inhibition of either PI3K or mTOR pathways does not prevent progression from high-grade dysplasia to anal cancer in mice and may promote carcinogenesis in mice with established high-grade anal dysplasia.

Anal cancer is a disease of increasing incidence in the United States and is associated with persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Immunocompromised patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at higher risk for persistent HPV infection thus at higher risk for developing subsequent anal cancer. Current treatments for anal dysplasia, to prevent anal cancer, are poorly tolerated, not specific to diseased tissues, and are associated with high recurrence rates. Prior studies have demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of protease inhibitors (PIs), used previously to treat HIV, in the setting of HPV-induced cervical dysplasia. The goal of this study is to test whether the PI Saquinavir (SQV) can prevent the progression of high-grade anal dysplasia to anal cancer in an HPV-associated mouse model of anal carcinogenesis. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Female K14E6/E7 mice, which express HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins in their epithelium, were used for these experiments. Mice began a 20-week treatment at 25 weeks of age, the age at which greater than?75% of mice have high-grade dysplasia, based on prior experiments. Mice were randomized into?four treatment groups (&gt;10 mice per group):?control/no treatment,?topical 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) only,?topical SQV (2.5%) only, and topical SQV with DMBA.?The carcinogen, DMBA, was utilized to ensure progression of high-grade dysplasia to cancer within 20 weeks. The mice underwent weekly observations for overt anal tumor development. After the 20-week treatment period, mouse anuses were harvested and anal tissue was evaluated by a pathologist. A Fischer&rsquo;s exact test was used to analyze both overt anal tumor incidence and tissue histology. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

When comparing tumor onset, 13% (2/15) of control mice and none of SQV only (0/16) mice developed overt tumors. Of the mice treated with DMBA, 100% (15/15) of the DMBA only mice developed overt tumors while only 67% (12/18) of the SQV with DMBA mice grew tumors (p-value=0.0213). When comparing tissue histology, 86% (12/14) of control mice stayed at high-grade dysplasia with 14% (2/14) regressing to low-grade dysplasia. For mice treated with SQV only, 91% (10/11) of mice had a regression in anal dysplasia and 1% (1/11) remained high-grade. 100% (15/15) of the DMBA only mice had progressed to cancer, while SQV with DMBA had 2% regression to low-grade dysplasia or normal histology (3/15), 53% (8/15) remained at high-grade dysplasia, and 27% (4/15) progressed to cancer. There was a statistically significant downgrade of disease when comparing tissue histology between the four treatment groups (p-value=1.5x10-6). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Topical Saquinavir (SQV) prevents the progression of anal dysplasia to cancer and results in regression of anal dysplasia in mice with established high-grade anal dysplasia. Thus, topical Saquinavir may be an effective treatment for anal dysplasia and the prevention of anal cancer.

Infection with high-risk strains of HPV is a major contributor to the development of anal dysplasia and anal cancer. Current therapies for anal dysplasia are invasive, non-specific to diseased tissue and associated with high recurrence rates. We have previously shown that topical application of a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor prevents anal cancer development in an HPV-associated mouse model of anal carcinogenesis. The purpose of this study is to determine if topical treatment with a single PI3K or mTOR inhibitor can halt the progression of low-grade anal dysplasia to anal cancer in an HPV mouse model. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: K14E6/E7 transgenic mice, which express HPV16 oncoproteins E6 and E7 in their epithelium, were randomized into six treatments groups (&ge;30 mice per group). Mice began daily topical treatments at the anus at 15 weeks of age, at which time the majority of mice exhibit low-grade anal dysplasia. Treatment groups included control/no treatment, topical carcinogen, 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), topical Pictilisib (0.5%), a PI3K inhibitor, with or without DMBA, and topical Sapanisertib (1%), an mTOR inhibitor, with or without DMBA. DMBA was used to promote the progression of low-grade anal dysplasia to cancer. Mice were monitored weekly for overt anal tumors and treated for 20 weeks. After the treatment period, anuses were harvested and tissue was evaluated for microscopic cancer. Tissue was immunohistochemically stained for markers of PI3K and mTOR activity, pAKT and pS6, respectively, and analyzed using ImageJ. Treatment groups were compared via one-way ANOVA.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: All mice treatment groups without DMBA did not develop overt anal tumors, while 88% (28/32) of DMBA only mice grew tumors. For mice treated with Pictilisib with DMBA and Sapanisertib with DMBA, 77% (23/30) and 58% (18/31) developed overt tumors, respectively. All mice treatment groups without DMBA had no microscopic anal cancer while 97% (31/32) of DMBA only mice developed cancer after 20 weeks. For mice given Pictilisib with DMBA and Sapanisertib with DMBA, 93% (28/30) and 97% (30/31) developed microscopic cancer, respectively. For histology, mouse tissues treated with Pictilisib with or without DMBA displayed a decrease in pAKT (PI3K signaling) compared to control (p-value&lt;0.05) and DMBA only (p-value&lt;0.05). Mouse tissues treated with Sapanisertib with DMBA displayed a decrease in pS6 (mTOR signaling) as compared to control only (p-value&lt;0.05).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Topical treatments with a single PI3K or mTOR pathway inhibitor may delay the onset of overt anal tumors, but do not prevent anal carcinogenesis in mice with established low-grade anal dysplasia.

Despite its prevalence, there are no therapeutic modalities or serologic markers to help understand NAFLD activity, diagnose NASH severity, and elucidate mechanisms underlying disease progression. We evaluated 44 plasma cytokine, chemokine, and adipokine biomarkers and their associations with liver histology as potential discriminators of disease status in a cohort of severely obese patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Blood and a liver biopsy were obtained from 79 IRB-consented adult patients undergoing bariatric surgery at UF Health. Biopsy specimens were evaluated by a single, blinded pathologist for histologic features of NAFLD/NASH according to a validated NAFLD activity scoring (NAS) system (score from 0-8). NASH diagnosis was classified as definitive NASH or non-NASH. Fibrosis was scored according to Brunt criteria. Plasma inflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and obesity-related adipokine levels were quantified using Luminex multiplex immunoassays. Demographic data and medical history were also collected.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 18% of evaluated subjects were diagnosed with NASH. The NAFLD activity score distribution had a mean of 1.9 and a standard deviation of 1.8. The fibrosis stage distribution had a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 1.23. We found that IP-10 and CCL22 were associated with both NASH diagnosis and liver fibrosis. These associations hold when controlling for sex, age, BMI, diabetes, tobacco, and alcohol use. Diabetes was also strongly associated with NASH diagnosis. IP-10 was more strongly correlated with NASH diagnosis, while CCL22 was more strongly correlated with liver fibrosis. Using bivariate regression, we found those with a NASH diagnosis had higher IP-10 levels (P=.003). For every 1 pg/mL increase in IP-10, there was a .04% increase in the probability of having NASH. We also found that those with higher fibrosis scores had higher CCL22 levels (P=.001). For every 1 pg/ml increase in CCL22, there was a .0014 unit increase in fibrosis score. Circulating plasma IP-10 and CCL22 levels also correlated with each other, suggesting a common pathophysiological mechanism. A relationship between plasma IP-10 levels and NASH has previously been reported in subjects with NASH, NAFLD, and healthy volunteers as controls. Our results confirm those findings in severely obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that circulating plasma CCL22 levels may be a valid marker for liver fibrosis in patients with BMI&gt;35.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Non-invasive measures of NASH and hepatic fibrosis are critical for diagnosis and treatment. This work confirms the utility of IP-10 as a marker for NASH and provides evidence for CCL22 as a potential marker for NASH associated liver fibrosis. To the extent that these conditions overlap, they may be useful together as well.

Via pre-transplant serum cytokines and chemokines, we have identified a pre-LT biomarker panel, the immune frailty index (IFI), which accurately stratifies patients at high risk for post-transplant morbidity and mortality. Patients with low IFI (score 0-2) have 95.5% 1yr survival compared with 46.2% for high IFI (score 3-4). The exact genetic mechanisms responsible are largely unknown. Here we evaluate the gene expression patterns responsible for these immunophenotypic alterations.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patient serum was obtained pre-transplant and PBMCs isolated per protocol. Multiplex cytokine and chemokine analysis was performed via Luminex. IFI was calculated from pre-transplant HCV viremia, Eotaxin, MMP3, and Fractalkine. IFI-high were matched 1:2 with IFI-low based on age, sex, and cause of liver disease and were compared to healthy controls (NHC). RNA-seq was performed on isolated PBMCs and gene expression patterns assessed. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Gene expression analysis was performed on 22 LT recipients (n=7 IFI high, n=15 IFI low) and eight NHCs. Donor and recipient characteristics were similar between groups. IFI high had more positive cultures within 1-yr post-op (4 vs 1, p&lt;0.01) and lower 2-yr survival (56% -v- 100%, p&lt;0.01). PCA analysis demonstrated four patterns of gene expression (clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4). Four patients died during a median follow up of two years, all within the IFI-high group. Among these, 3/4 (75%) died secondary to infection-related complications (i.e. immune dysfunction), all in cluster 3. IFI-high patients predominantly grouped in cluster 3 and showed the most variability when compared to NHCs, cluster 5 (Figure 1). Gene pathway analysis revealed oxidative phosphorylation genes were comparatively upregulated and glycolysis was downregulated in cluster 3. Specifically, genes responsible for mitochondrial respiration were significantly upregulated in cluster 3, suggesting dysregulated cellular energetics. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pre-transplant immune dysfunction in LT recipients is associated with significant alterations in immune cell metabolics, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. This leads to impaired cellular function and differentiation. This may direct immune frailty and increase LT recipients&rsquo; susceptibility to post-operative complications and death. A better understanding of these pathways will allow for better assessment and targeted interventions for patients pre-transplant to improve outcomes.

More than 95% of PDAC&rsquo;s harbor KRAS mutations and exhibit hyperactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is overexpressed in PDAC and activates the expression of Type I Interferon (IFN&beta;) and NF&kappa;&Beta;-linked cytokines. Systemically administered STING agonists are an emerging class of cancer therapeutic currently tested in clinical trials.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Trametinib or Cobimetinib were used for MEK inhibition (MEKi). STING was activated with a small molecule STING agonist diABZI. Cell viability was quantified by 2D-CellTiterGlo assay. High throughput screen of a library with 430 kinase inhibitors was utilized to assess the interaction between diABZI and other signaling pathways. Cytokine levels were measured by RT-PCR, Luminex, and ELISA assays. RNASeq transcriptomic analysis was performed. Phosphoproteomic analyses were performed by western blots with targets for MAPK, STING, and cytokine signaling pathways. CFPAC-1 and XWR7 tumor cells were injected subcutaneously in NCG mice and caliper measurements of the tumors conducted every 3 days.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: High throughput kinome screen revealed that the top 7/10 chemicals with the highest levels of synergistic decrease in cell viability when combined with diABZI were MEK inhibitors, while the ones with the strongest antagonism were inhibitors of JAK, an essential effector of cytokine signaling(A). STING activation with diABZI had a variable effect on the cytotoxicity of MEKi across PDAC cell lines, most notably in CFPAC-1 cells where Trametinib IC50 was decreased 2<sup>9</sup>-fold(B).<sup>. </sup>diABZI combination with Cobimetinib led to sustained -tumor size suppression in vivo in CFPAC-1(C) and XWR-7 (D). RNASeq, RT-PCR, Human Cyto/chemokine 38-plex assay and western analyses revealed synergistic increase in production and signaling of IFN&beta; and NF&kappa;&Beta;-linked cytokines like IL-6 and TNF&alpha; with diABZI and MEKi combination (E-G). Mechanistically, MEKi amplified both type I IFN and NF&kappa;B signaling induced by diABZI, as measured by pIRF3 and pP65 respectively(H). The synergistic antitumor effects were dependent on IFN&beta; signaling, since the anti-tumor effects of MEKi and diABZI combination were reversed in CFPAC-1 and SUIT2 IFNAR<sup>KO</sup> models in vitro (I) and in vivo (J).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: MEKi synergizes with the STING agonist diABZI by amplifying acute expression of IFN&beta; and represents a promising treatment combination in pancreatic cancer.

Specific subpopulations of macrophages are hypothesized to fine tune the immune response after damage, promoting either normal regenerative, or aberrant fibrotic healing. Our objective was to identify macrophage subpopulations and/or gene signatures which could direct musculoskeletal healing through regenerative or fibrotic means. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Single cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA) data at baseline, early and late timepoints were assembled from a variety of musculoskeletal injuries, including regenerative and fibrotic mouse volumetric muscle loss (VML), regenerative digit tip amputation (DTA) and fibrotic heterotopic ossification (HO). R packages Harmony and Seurat were used for data integration, analysis and visualizations. After individual dataset clustering, macrophages were isolated using the gene markers Aif1, Adgre1, and Csf1r and confirmed using SingleR. Pdgfra-expressing MPCs were identified and analyzed for receptor-ligand interactions with macrophages using CellChat. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Unsupervised clustering from DTA, VML, and HO models identified two clusters enriched for fibrotic macrophages (80.5% and 85.1%, respectively), two clusters enriched for regenerative macrophages (62.1% and 55.8%, respectively), and one cluster of mixed, baseline macrophages (Fig. 1A). Pearson correlation showed distinct transcriptional programs of macrophages derived from regenerative of fibrotic conditions (Fig. 1B). Module scoring for known pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophage markers show this separation exists outside of the traditional M1/M2 classification. Receptor/ligand analysis in early regenerative macrophages (Acp5<sup>+</sup>, Srebp1<sup>+</sup>, Prdx4<sup>+</sup>, Nrp2<sup>+</sup>) showed enhanced expression of platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) ligands in regenerative, but not fibrotic conditions (Fig. 1D). Specifically, Pdgfa and Pdgfb gene expression was found to be upregulated in the early regenerative macrophages, suggesting an increased macrophage-MPC crosstalk via PDGF pathway in regenerative conditions (Fig. 1E).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our research has identified divergent subsets of macrophages present within regenerative and fibrotic injury conditions. Additionally, we identify macrophage derived PDGF ligands which could contribute to normal tissue repair across multiple models of musculoskeletal injury. Further characterization of these macrophage subtypes could provide a therapeutic target to tune the healing microenvironment towards more favorable conditions.

Barrett<sup>1</sup>, K. Mangum<sup>1</sup>, S. Sharma<sup>1</sup>, K. Gallagher<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan, Vascular Surgery, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
T-cell activation in wounds is mediated, in part, by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) which are recruited as first responders following injury and also serve as antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the wound bed. Normally, wound T-cells revert to a reparative phenotype in the later stages of wound healing. Diabetic wound T-cells, however, are mostly the pro-inflammatory Th17 phenotype even at later days of wound healing. We hypothesized that diabetic pDCs may contribute to this phenomenon, and the persistent inflammation seen in these wounds, due to altered, proinflammatory state. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks were wounded and the resulting wound pDCs were harvested 24hrs later. These cells were analyzed by qPCR, ChIP and ELISA for various inflammatory cytokines and epigenetic markers were performed and compared to their normal diet (ND) counterparts. The HFD pDCs were also co-cultured with na&iuml;ve T cells from normal, wild type mice for 3 days, after which T-cell lineage was determined by flow cytometry. Additionally, a separate set of HFD mice were treated to antibody-mediated pDC depletion 48hrs before wounding and daily after wounding for seven days. The wound T-cell lineage from these mice (and their placebo littermate controls) were studied by flow cytometry.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
An increase in activation of Th17 cytotoxic T-cells in HFD mice was noted on flow cytometry following co-culture with pDC. Additionally, there was a significant increase in inflammatory markers suggesting a clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cell lineage. Quantitative PCR of pDC reveal increased production of cytokines (IL-6, and TGF-beta) necessary for activation of T cells, with a significant increase noted in the HFD mice. Interestingly, antibody mediated depletion of pDCs in HFD mice led to more reparative Th2 and T-reg T-cell phenotype and improved wound healing. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Activation of T cells within diabetic wounds is mediated, in part, by pDCs which predispose clonal expansion towards cytotoxic Th17 T-cells. This effect was reversed by depleting pDCs prior to and during wounding. While the mechanism for this remains unclear, these findings suggest a new cell-type target critical to curbing persistent inflammation and improving wound healing.

Mohottige Don<sup>1</sup>, O. De La Rosa<sup>1</sup>, Y. Chen<sup>1</sup>, R. White<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, San Diego, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive disease that is poorly responsive to available immunotherapy approaches, such as checkpoint inhibitors. Post-translational protein modification (PTM) by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is upregulated in cancer, and high expression of SUMOylation-related factors correlates with poor survival in PC. TAK-981 is a novel inhibitor of SUMOylation that has demonstrated induction of anti-tumor immune responses in preclinical models. Our hypothesis is that TAK-981 will decrease SUMOylated proteins and subsequently modulate the tumor microenvironment to increase anti-tumor immunity. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
In order to recapitulate the microenvironment of human PC, a 3-dimensional organoid cell line derived from a genetically-engineered &ldquo;KPC&rdquo; mouse was used. Organoids were injected orthotopically into the head of the pancreas via laparotomy. Once tumors reached 5-7 mm in diameter on ultrasound imaging, mice were randomized to one of two treatment groups: Control/Vehicle versus TAK-981 (15mg/kg) delivered daily via intraperitoneal injection. Tumors were harvested on day 14 for gene expression analysis by quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Tumor growth (Fig. 1) in the TAK-981 15mg/KG daily group (mean + SD volume = 207 + 109 mm<sup>3</sup>) was significantly inhibited compared to the vehicle group (595 + 141 mm<sup>3</sup>, p &lt; 0.01). Immunohistochemical staining for CD 31 (Fig. 2) and Caspase 3 indicated a reduction of angiogenesis and increased apoptosis of tumor cells, consistent with the well-established roles of SUMOylation in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Gene expression analysis of tumor lysates showed a 26-fold increase in expression of Interferon beta (p&lt;0.05), and an almost 2-fold increase in expression of genes related to dendritic cell activation, including CD80 (p&lt;0.05) and CD86 (p=0.14) in the TAK-981 group, suggesting a modulation of the immune microenvironment. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our results suggest that the inhibition of SUMOylation with TAK-981 is associated with improved local tumor control and changes in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We expect that TAK-981 will improve PC responsiveness to immunotherapy, such as with checkpoint inhibitors.

Bohan<sup>1</sup>, S. Han<sup>1</sup>, S. Hughes<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Florida, College Of Medicine, Department Of Surgery, Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy known for its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The IL-1 axis plays a key role in carcinogenesis and a receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) is currently under investigation in clinical trials for the treatment of PDAC. However, little remains known about the relationship between the IL-1 axis and tumor immune response. Using a bioinformatics approach, we sought to determine how the expression of the IL-1 axis, specifically IL-1&alpha;, IL-1&beta;, IL-1R<sub>1</sub>, IL-1R<sub>2</sub>, and IL-1RN, impacts tumor immune response in PDAC. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Gene expression and DNA methylation data were attained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Immune infiltration data was gathered from the NCI Genomic Data Commons and Cancer Research Institute iAtlas. Information on gene expression and DNA methylation were analyzed using two-tail, two-sample unequal variance t-tests. Spearman analysis was conducted to determine significance in correlation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 169 PDAC patients and 50 benign pancreatic samples were assessed for genetic expression difference. 169 PDAC patients and 10 benign pancreatic samples were assessed for DNA methylation differences. IL-1&alpha;, IL-1R<sub>2</sub>, and IL-1RN were markedly increased in PDAC tumor tissue when compared to benign pancreatic tissue (p&lt;0.001). DNA methylation of IL-1&alpha; and IL-1RN was decreased accordingly (p=0.001, p&lt;0.001). In PDAC samples, IL-1&alpha; expression was positively correlated to IL-1R<sub>2</sub> and IL-1RN expression (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, increased IL-1RN expression was correlated with decreasing CD8 T-cells (rho=-0.187, p=0.022), decreasing lymphocytes (rho=-0.234, p=0.004), and increasing M2 macrophages (rho=0.274, p=0.001). Furthermore, increasing IL-1R<sub>1 </sub>was correlated with increasing CD8 T-cells (rho= 0.214, p=0.009). Overall macrophages were found to increase with increasing IL-1&alpha; (rho=0.204, p=0.012) and IL-1RN (rho=0.230, p=0.005).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These data suggest that the IL-1 axis plays a pivotal role not only in PDAC carcinogenesis but also tumor immune response. Further studies are needed to determine how the IL-1 axis may be utilized to improve treatment and patient outcomes in PDAC.

Dudeja<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Miami, Surgery, Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Cysteine proteases are lysosomal enzymes involved in protein degradation. Cathepsin B (CTSB) is one such protease which has shown to promote pancreatic cancer progression from pre-invasive lesions to invasive cancer. However, its significance in the tumor microenvironment has never been investigated. In the current study, we investigate the effects of targeting stromal CTSB in pancreatic cancer (PDAC).


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: To study the significance of CTSB in PDAC microenvironment, C57BL/6J (WT) or CTSB -/- mice were implanted with KPC pancreatic cancer cells orthotopically into the pancreas or subcutaneously on the flank. To specifically investigate the significance of CTSB in pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), PSCs were isolated from C57BL/6J (WT) or CTSB -/- mice and were orthotopically injected with KPC cancer cells into the tail of pancreas of WT mice. Tumors were analyzed at endpoint using flow cytometry. To further study the dependence of effects of CTSB in PSCs on adaptive immune cells, WT or CTSB -/- PSCs were co-injected with KPC cells into Rag 1 -/- mice (which lack a functional adaptive immune system) or CD8+ T cell depleted mice (anti-CD8 mAb, 250ug/dose every 3 days). In vitro, WT or CTSB-/- PSCs, inactivated after embedding in matrigel domes, were co-cultured with KPC cancer cells across a transwell, thereby only permitting paracrine interaction between the two cell types. Expression of cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) markers was assessed using RT-PCR.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: CTSB-/- mice formed significantly smaller pancreatic tumors as compared to WT mice in both orthotopic and subcutaneous models. Co-injections of WT PSC with KPC cells led to increased tumor growth as compared to KPC cancer cells alone, however, co-injection with CTSB-/- PSCs abrogated this tumor promoting effect. Flow cytometric analysis revealed increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the KPC + CB-/- PSC group as compared to KPC + WT PSC group. Subsequent studies revealed that the anti-tumorigenic effect of CTSB-/- PSCs was dependent on functional CD8 T-cells, as this effect was lost when co-injections were performed in Rag 1-/- mice or CD8+ T cell depleted mice. In vitro, co-culture of CTSB-/- PSCs with KPC led to reduced expression of inflammatory CAF (iCAF) markers like IL-6 and IL-11 when compared to co-culture of WT PSCs with KPC.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Stromal CTSB has a significant role in promoting pancreatic cancer tumor growth in pre-clinical models. Targeting CTSB can inhibit polarization of PSCs towards an inflammatory phenotype in-vitro and reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in-vivo. CTSB targeting can emerge as a novel therapeutic strategy against pancreatic cancer.

Development of biomarkers is an active area of research, but predictions of overall survival (OS) remain highly variable. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are known to exert both pro- and anti-tumor effects and impact long-term prognosis. In this study, we use machine learning-based clustering and survival analysis to identify TIL-based phenotypes for prognostication.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified 360 patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas with biopsy-proven HCC. Data obtained from cBioPortal and TIMER2.0 included TIL infiltration patterns identified using CIBERSORT, as well as demographics (age, race, sex) and tumor stage and grade.

All computations were performed in Python using scikit-learn and scikit-survival. We performed K-Means clustering of the CIBERSORT output to identify potential TIL phenotypes. We then held out a cluster-stratified 20% test set. Candidate models included Cox Proportional Hazards with and without LASSO regularization, Random Survival Forest, and Regression Tree-based Gradient-Boosted Cox. Each model was trained separately on the raw CIBERSORT output (subset 1) and on the remaining variables listed, including identified cluster (subset 2). The best predictors from each subset were then used to evaluate candidate composite models, and the concordance indices on the held-out test set were compared across all models.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Five clusters were identified, with a silhouette score of 0.219. A baseline Cox model trained on all predictors achieved c=0.589 on the test set. The best performing model overall was Cox without LASSO on subset 2, with c=0.686. Also notable was the composite LASSO model, achieving c=0.662, with predictors including tumor stage and grade, cluster 0, age at diagnosis, race, and four lymphocyte lines (Macrophages M0, M2, resting CD4 memory T-cell, and activated mast cell).

Cluster 0 was noted to have the shortest median OS vs all other clusters (33 vs 81 months, p&lt;0.001), with no differences in non-TIL characteristics. Comparison of TIL fractions demonstrated that Cluster 0 had higher levels of macrophage M2, but lower M1, CD8 T-cells, Tregs and T-cell follicular helper cells. Univariate Cox showed that M2 macrophages remained a negative predictor of survival (HR: 6.1 (1.4-26.7), p&lt;0.05), while CD8 T-cells were a positive predictor (HR: 0.94 (0.11-0.84), p&lt;0.034).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This approach improves predictive capability vs baseline Cox and identifies an important TIL phenotype (Cluster 0) with an unfavorable prognosis in HCC. Further characterization of this subset of tumors represents an area for future research.

Ronnekleiv-Kelly<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin, Department Of Surgery, Division Of Surgical Oncology, Madison, WI, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Wisconsin, Biotechnology Center, Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The circadian clock is a cell-autonomous molecular feedback mechanism found in nearly every organ of the body that is designed to maintain homeostasis. Previous studies have suggested disruption of the clock in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may portend worse outcomes for patients. We sought to further understand the ramifications of disrupting clock function on PDAC progression.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: CRISPR/Cas9 was utilized to achieve circadian disruption by knockout of the core circadian clock gene Arntl in a cell line derived from an aggressive PDAC mouse model (Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup> Tp53<sup>-/-</sup> Pdx-1 Cre (KPC)). Two separate Arntl knockout clones (KPC<sup>AKO</sup>) were validated with targeted sequencing and western blot analysis. To create tumors, a total of 100,000 cells from either KPC or KPC<sup>AKO</sup> clones in 50 &mu;L (1:1 DMEM:Matrigel) were injected into the right flank of 6&ndash;8-week-old syngeneic wildtype C57Bl/6J mice. Tumors were measured twice weekly for 28 days, and tumor weight was collected at the study endpoint. To assess for the presence of chemotherapeutic resistance, cells were subjected to gemcitabine and cell survival and Caspase 3/7 activity were assessed. All in vitro experiments were independently replicated three times.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Sequencing of both KPC<sup>AKO </sup>clones indicated the presence of an identical frameshift mutation of Arntl resulting in early truncation of the ARNTL protein. Loss of protein was confirmed with western blot analysis. Heterotopic flank tumor experiments revealed an early acceleration of cell growth in both KPC<sup>AKO</sup> clones resulting in larger tumor weight (Figure 1). To identify additional mechanisms of selective growth advantage, cell survival was compared following 48-hours of gemcitabine treatment, which demonstrated resistance of both KPC<sup>AKO</sup> clones compared to wildtype KPC (IC50 28 and 21 vs. 12 nM [p=0.03]). Increased survival of the KPC<sup>AKO</sup> cells was found to be secondary to increased resistance to apoptosis with 25 nM-1 &mu;M treatment (2.6-5.3-fold increased resistance; all p&lt;0.05). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The core circadian gene Arntl is essential for maintaining clock functionality. Disruption of Arntl in a PDAC cell line led to a more aggressive cancer phenotype and conferred resistance to gemcitabine &ndash; a backbone of PDAC chemotherapy. Furthermore, KPC<sup>AKO</sup> resistance appeared to be secondary to decreased apoptosis. Future experiments will begin to parse the mechanism by which loss of Arntl promotes PDAC progression and therapeutic resistance.

The most common subtypes include well-differentiated (WD) and de-differentiated (DD) tumors, characterized by Ch12q amplification (including oncogenes MDM2 and CDK4). Complete surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment, given its poor response to traditional chemotherapy, radiation and targeted small-molecules. Further research is urgently needed, yet few preclinical model systems exist, noting historically low success rate in establishing cell cultures and patient-derived xenografts (PDX), with virtually no models available for the study of WD LPS. Herein, we describe for the first time the establishment of patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTO) in both DD and WD LPS, and its potential applications as a preclinical model. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patient tumor samples were harvested from freshly excised surgical specimens and dissociated into single cells, followed by suspension into a solubilized basement membrane preparation. Upon reaching confluency, newly developed organoids were utilized in various proof-of-principle applications including histologic analysis, short-term passaging, high-throughput drug screening, fluorescent microscopy, intact cellular respirometry and the establishment of murine xenografts. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis by use of MDM2 and CEP12 (Chromosome 12 centromere) probes were used to confirm Ch12q amplification.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Between Dec 2020 and Aug 2021, 18/18 unique patient samples were successfully established as PDTOs (Fig1A). FISH assessment confirmed the presence of Ch12q amplification in all samples analyzed. PDTOs recapitulated the histology of primary patient samples (Fig1B), and retained viability up to four passages (Fig1C). PDTOs were applied to drug screenings via luciferase-based viability assays (Fig1D) and intact respirometry using Seahorse XF analyzers. Super-resolution fluorescent microscopy techniques (Zeiss LSM-880, Airyscan) were optimized to analyze intracellular components within living PDTOs.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: WD/DD LPS is an understudied, heterogeneous neoplasm with a dismal response to current medical therapies. Further investigation is hindered by the lack of available preclinical model systems. To overcome this critical limitation, we have demonstrated the ability to establish PDTOs in LPS that retain genomic alterations and histologic characteristics of primary tissue. The multiple applications of PDTOs demonstrate its relevancy as a preclinical model for both disease modeling and therapeutic testing. We anticipate PDTOs will accelerate the study of this rare disease and foresee its potential to predict therapy response in future patients.

Dietary fatty acids (omega-3, omega-6, and saturated) and their metabolic products elicit differential downstream effects on macrophage and T-cell maturation, with omega-3s abrogating murine melanoma and human breast cancer progression, while saturated fats elicit near opposite effects. Diets which alter melanoma metabolism or systemic immunity may prove to be cost-effective adjuncts to improve ICI response rates.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In a synchronous, heterogenous model of metastatic melanoma, C57-BL6/J mice were injected with YUMM 1.7 melanoma cells (primary tumor) in left flanks and a metastatic mimetic - YUMMER 1.7 (irradiated, immunogenic strain of YUMM 1.7) - in the right. Mice were fed control (CTL) chow or diets enriched in omega-3 rich fish oil (FO), omega-6 rich corn oil (CO), pork saturated fat (SAT) (all 10% w/w, 30%kcal/kcal) or an omega-3/omega-6 balanced diet (FO/CO - 5%/5%), starting day 12 post tumor implantation. Intraperitoneal &alpha;PD1 or IgG2a vehicle were injected q3-4 days starting day 12. Tumors were assessed for growth, harvested at day 26, and characterized via flow cytometry. In serum-fed (10% FBS + 1% BSA) conditions, YUMM 1.7 and YUMMER 1.7 cells were incubated with 100uM docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), linoleic acid (LA), palmitic acid (PA) or 50uM DHA + 50uM LA for 48 hours and assessed for number and morphology. All significant results (p&lt;0.05) assessed by 2-way ANOVA or t-test. 

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: FO decreased YUMM tumor volume in vehicle (-28%) and &alpha;PD-1 (-38%) treated mice vs. CTL, while FO/CO exhibited non-significant (NS) decreases (-29% and -28%). CO (+9%, -17%) and SAT (+12%, -14%) elicited NS effects on tumor growth. FO and FO/CO increased YUMM tumor monocytes (CD45+, CD19-, CD11b+, Ly6C+, Ly6G -) vs. CTL, CO, and SAT. FO increased CD69+ CD8 T cells as compared to CO and SAT (NS FO vs. CTL). Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids trended towards increasing in vitro cell growth in YUMM: DHA (+19%), LA (+28%) and DHA/LA (+17%) vs. CTL, PA remained stable (-5%). DHA elicited a dose-dependent effect on cell growth, with no difference between 0, 10 and 100uM, but 200uM eliciting a 53% growth inhibition and blunting of typical dendritic processes. In YUMMER: DHA (+3%), DHA/LA (-7%), PA (- 3%) remained stable, while LA (+46%) trended towards increased cell growth. 

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Fish oil impaired in vivo melanoma tumor growth, increasing tumor microenvironment monocytes, and eliciting dose-dependent abrogation of melanoma cells in vitro. Corn oil and saturated fat induced mixed minimal effects on melanoma growth in vivo and in vitro. Both metabolic and immune mechanisms may underlie the efficacy of dietary omega-3 fatty acids in modulating tumor growth. Further studies are warranted to investigate the benefit or detriment of dietary fatty acids when paired with &alpha;PD-1 immunotherapy.

Transplantation of healthy intestinal epithelial cells has been introduced as a resource for treatment of intestinal disorders including intestinal failure due to short bowel syndrome and genetic disorders associated with small intestine nutritional absorption such as Celiac disease. In the current study, we examined implantation of normal human intestine cells to study the possibility of replicating normal intestinal crypts in the donor site.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Human tissues were obtained from de-identified discarded specimens following clinical surgical pathology evaluation. Human intestinal crypts were harvested, and cultured to produce viable enteroids by applying previously published methods. Enteroids were seeding in Matrigel matrix with L-WRN conditioned culture medium, then implanted into the skin of 6 immunosuppressed rats (Rag1/Il2 knockout) with subcutaneous injection. After 7 days, the specimen was analyzed to determine possible replication of human enteroids in subcutaneous tissue. Histology was analyzed using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining and immunofluorescence (IF) staining.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

All 6 immunosuppressed rats survived on postoperative day seven and did not show any sign of rejection or inflammation at the injection sites. In five out of the six specimens, we were able to confirm enteroids survival and replication based on the morphological structures with H&amp;E staining and/or the epithelial identity by E-cadherin and human nuclear antigen double-IF staining (Figure 1). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 

In this study for the first time, we demonstrated successful replication of human enteroids in immunosuppressed rat&rsquo;s subcutaneous tissue. We observed that enteroids will form normal crypt pattern in the implanted tissue. This study provides the evidence that enteroids have the potential to be used as a source of intestinal stem cell therapy in intestinal disorders such as short bowel syndrome and Celiac disease. Immunosuppressed rodents are excellent choice for implanting the human cells due to lower risk of rejection. Next step would be to study the possibility of implanting human intestinal cells in small intestine of animal models.

Stomach, small intestine, and colon have distinct patterns of contraction related to their specific function. Gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders are common, sometimes with debilitating symptoms. Post-operative ileus is associated with increase length of stay and health care cost. Currently, there is no accurate measurement system to diagnose GI dysmotility or predict GI motility dysfunction post operatively. Wireless skin patches have been introduced to provide accurate noninvasive measurement of GI myoelectric activity which is essential for developing neuro-stimulation devices to treat GI motility disorders. The aim of this study is comparing the patch measurements with the internally measured myoelectrical signals to determine to what extent the external readings are able to identify the organ of origin of a signal.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
4 Juvenile mini-Yucatan pigs underwent laparotomy. Three 8-element commercial linear array of electrodes were sutured to each of the stomach, small intestine and colon serosa. The 8 individual elements of each electrode were configured as 4 bipolar pairs of signals from each organ. Wires were exited through the abdominal wall and the digitalized signals were collected by a wireless data acquisition receptor. After incision closure, 4 external skin patches were placed on the abdomen to record the signals through the skin and transfer the data to the same data acquisition system simultaneously with the internal inputs. Pigs were kept for 6 days post-operatively with wireless sensors allowing them moving within their pens while the sensors were continuously recording the data from both measuring systems.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Internal sensors provided rich signals for each organ. External skin patches detected a substantial fraction of the myoelectric activities measured directly by the internal electrodes on the serosa. A clear correlation in the frequency spectrum was observed between the internal and external readings (fig 1). On average, stomach had a sharp peak of frequency at 5 cpm, with occasional variations at 10, 15 and 20 cpm (the multiples of its fundamental frequency). Small intestine showed a greater frequency with peaks within 15-18 cpm. Colon displayed a dominant broad peak in the 4.5-6 cpm region, with occasional higher frequencies at its multiples (12.5 and 17.5 cpm).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The study demonstrates that the externally measured rhythmic signals originate as myoelectrical signals from the GI tract, known to be the driving signal of motor activity. Noninvasive wireless skin patches are able to provide accurate organ specific GI motility measurement to aid in diagnosing GI dysmotility disorders, predicting post-operative ileus, and developing organ-specific neuro-stimulation approaches.

Approximately 15% of colon cancers are MSI-high, a biomarker associated with more favorable prognosis and eligibility for the use of immunotherapy. Currently, clinical assays used to assess MSI-status rely on immunohistochemistry (IHC) or genetic analyses. Here, we apply deep learning algorithms for automated image recognition to histopathological slides, demonstrating that imaging-based biomarkers correlate with results obtained through IHC and sequencing, using slides already produced in routine clinical workflows without need for additional tissue-destructive assays.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E)-stained colon cancer slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were divided into 512x512 pixel tiles and input into the Inception v3 Neural Network (Figure 1). Output is fed into a novel algorithm which calculates tile-level heterogeneity scores from the distribution of cosine distances of each tile to every other tile on the slide as the median absolute deviation/(1-median). Patient-level tumor heterogeneity score (THS) is defined as the 95%-ile of pooled tile-level scores from all the patients&rsquo; available slides. We then identify correlations between this image-derived score and clinical and molecular biomarkers (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Pearson tests).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The dataset consists of 1,170 whole slide images from 377 patients, divided into 1,633,675 tiles. MSI-high tumors had a significantly higher THS compared to MSS/MSI-low tumors (p &lt; .0001, data available for 201 patients). Similarly, THS was significantly higher in MLH1-silent vs. non-silent tumors (p &lt; .0001, available for 166 patients). Finally, two next generation sequencing-based MSI scores (MSI Mantis and MSIsensor, available for 356 and 369 patients, respectively) showed significant correlation with THS (r = .18 and .19, both with p &lt; .001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: MSI-status is an established biomarker in colon cancer, used for prognostication and to determine eligibility for immunotherapy. Building off the publicly available, pre-trained Inception image decomposition neural network, we designed a novel algorithm that correlates with MSI-status in colon tumors. The model requires only H&amp;E-stained images, without the need for specialized immunohistochemistry or genetic MSI-detection techniques that may not be widely available. The ability to predict MSI-status from histology images already available in a standard clinical workflow could have significant impact on the ease and cost of assessing this biomarker, expanding the population of patients tested for MSI and subsequently eligible for immunotherapy.

Identical dermal injuries can heal with varying degrees of fibrosis in different patients. Wound repair is an energy intensive process that is fueled by oxidative phosphorylation(OXPHOS) and glycolysis to generate ATP. Emerging evidence shows aerobic glycolysis is a preferred mechanism that underlies pathologic fibrosis (in radiation/cancer), but its role in physiologic wound healing is unknown. As proliferation and ECM production of fibroblasts to rebuild the dermis relies on increased lactate production, a prelude to shift to aerobic glycolysis, we hypothesize differences in intrinsic fibroblast bioenergetic metabolism/aerobic glycolysis underlie differential scarring in patients.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We created a biorepository of paired normal-skin, c-section scar tissue and fibroblasts from abdominoplasty samples derived from patients with clinically stratified low scar(LS) and high scar(HS) phenotypes using Vancouver Scar Scale &lt;3 vs. &gt;6 respectively. Expression of Pyruvate Kinase M2(PKM2), a critical modulator of aerobic glycolysis, and lactate dehydrogenase(LDHA) were measured in patient skin(IHC). OXPHOS(OCR), glycolysis(ECAR), and ATP at resting, under stress, and TGFb treatment were analyzed in fibroblasts(seahorse assays), along with expression of PKM2 and LDHA(Protein simpleWES). LS/HS human fibroblasts(10<sup>6</sup> cells/wound) were transferred to 6mm full thickness stented wounds on SCID mice(8-10wk; F). Wounds were harvested at d7 and d28, and wound closure(H/E), aSMA, PKM2 and LDHA(staining), inflammatory profile(Luminex;IHC), collagen expression(trichrome) were analyzed.n=3 biologic replicates/group, p-values by ANOVA.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Expression of PKM2 and LDHA was markedly higher in both normal skin and scar tissue from HS. In vitro, RNA sequencing and GO analysis revealed several altered metabolic pathways in HS vs. LS normal skin fibroblasts. Both normal-skin and scar fibroblasts from HS had higher basal OCR and ECAR than LS(p&lt;0.01), suggesting more bioenergetic metabolism in high-scarrers. HS fibroblasts responded to stress(FCCP/Oligomycin treatments) with a significant increase in spare respiratory and glycolytic reserve capacity than LS(p&lt;0.01), along with an increase in phospoPKM2(p&lt;0.05). TGFb treatment also resulted in increased phospoPKM2 and LDHA in HS as compared to LS(p&lt;0.05). In vivo, murine wounds with HS fibroblasts showed expedited wound closure at d7 with reduced IL-10, IL-17, MIP-1a/b, and G-CSF expression via immunoplexing and had an increase in aSMA(25-fold) gene expression and staining. At d28, there was marked increase in PKM2+ and LDHA+ spindle-shaped cells in wounds with HS, along with pronounced collagen staining and thick epidermis.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Fibroblasts of different scarring phenotypes display characteristic bioenergetic metabolism profiles and produce distinct scarring in murine wounds. Our data suggests that a shift to aerobic glycolysis(Warburg effect) is associated with increased fibrosis(high scar).

Case-specific instrument trays reduce processing costs, physical strain, and operating room setup times. Traditionally, a 155-instrument head and neck tray has been used for lumpectomy, axilla, thyroid, and parathyroid cases at our VA Medical Center. Most of these instruments are unnecessary or redundant. With the increasing number of breast and endocrine surgery performed at our institution, tray downsizing could significantly reduce costs and improve OR efficiency.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Surgical staff identified instruments needed for a standard lumpectomy, lymph node dissection, thyroidectomy, and parathyroidectomy. Several existing head and neck trays were converted to breast/biopsy and thyroid trays. The number of breast, axilla, thyroid, and parathyroid cases from 2017 to 2020 was queried from our institution&#39;s surgical business operations manager. Instrument quantities were verified using instrument management software. Weights were taken on a digital scale, and sterile processing costs were estimated by central sterile supply managers and other published verified methods.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The new breast/biopsy and thyroid/parathyroid trays included 51 and 41 instruments respectively, a reduction of 67% and 74% from the previous trays. Reprocessing costs decreased from $79.05 to $26.01 and $20.91 respectively. With increasing breast and endocrine surgery performed at our institution, the annual reprocessing savings are estimated at nearly $5,000. The tray weights were reduced from 30 pounds to 14 and 10 pounds respectively. Setup time decreased from 11 to 4 minutes per use.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Right-sizing an antiquated head and neck tray into case-specific instrumentation reduces reprocessing costs. Lighter trays with fewer instruments allow for safer handling and transport by surgical personnel. These changes facilitate decreased OR setup time, contributing towards a culture of increased efficiency.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in the United States. Oncotype Dx (ODX) is a twenty-one gene assay that provides an individual analysis of tumor recurrence risk and provides chemotherapy recommendations for patients. Though shown to be clinically valid, the assay is not extensively used in eligible patients. The aims of this study were to evaluate adherence with the recommended ODX testing guidelines and examine changes in the ODX utilization trends over time.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective cohort study was performed on breast cancer patients from the National Cancer Database (2010-2017) who received ODX. This study first examined patients that met the indicated pathology for ODX, ie. early (T1-T2), lymph node negative with positive estrogen receptor (ER), positive progesterone receptor (PR) and negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). The demographic factors that affect the ODX adherence rate in this patient group were evaluated. Secondly, all patients who underwent ODX testing were assessed to evaluate the trend shift in ODX utilization over time. Clinicodemographic information was collected, as well as information regarding hospital type where treatment occurred. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with ODX testing among both groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 429,648 patients met the indicated pathology criteria for ODX, yet only 43.4% of the population underwent testing. On multivariate analysis, age, race, facility type, median income, tumor grade, and insurance status were all predictors of receiving ODX in eligible patients. Notably, Black and Hispanic women were less likely to undergo testing (OR: 0.899, 95% CI:0.874,0.924; OR:0.815, 95% CI:0.789,0.841) compared to white women. Academic research programs were more likely to adhere with testing guidelines (OR:1.128, 95% CI:1.108,1,145) compared to comprehensive community cancer programs. Patients with poorly differentiated tumors were more likely to receive the test (OR:1.181, 95% CI:1.154, 1.208) compared to patients with moderately differentiated tumor.

In addition to testing within guidelines, a notable amount of testing was performed on patients who did not fit the criteria for ODX. Including both patients that met and did not met the guidelines, 295,326 patients in total underwent ODX testing. Among them, 17% of patients were node positive, 2.9% had lower stage tumor than recommended (Tumor in situ), 1.8% had higher stage tumor than recommended (T3 or T4) and 2.2% had undergone neoadjuvant therapy. Testing rates for these outlier groups have increased over time.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
There are a considerable number of patients who are eligible for ODX but did not receive one, indicating potential barriers to care and disparities in breast cancer treatment. ODX usage has increased to include a broader population of patients, indicating that more research is needed to validate the effectiveness of the assay in these patient groups.

Breast cancer patients with a high comorbidity burden are known to have inferior oncologic outcomes. Health literacy (HL) has been shown to impact self-management of chronic conditions. The relationship between HL and comorbidity burden has not been established in breast cancer patients. This is important because HL specific tailored interventions may promote optimal management throughout the cancer care continuum. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between HL and comorbidity burden in breast cancer patients in order to establish a patient-centered approach to improving oncologic outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A validated 3-item HL questionnaire has been integrated into the standard intake forms for all new breast cancer patients seen at a single academic surgical oncology clinic. Each question is answered on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5. Patients who have a total score of &ge;7 are classified as having low HL, whereas patients with a score of &le;6 are classified as having high HL. HL data, as well as patient demographics, comorbidities, cancer characteristics, treatment and adherence are collected in a prospectively maintained database. Comorbidities of interest include coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cerebral vascular disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A high comorbidity burden was defined as &ge;2 of these diagnoses. Students t-tests and chi-square tests were utilized to compare patients with high and low HL utilizing SASv9.4 statistical software.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The study cohort included 580 breast cancer patients, 426 (73.5%) of which had high HL and 154 (26.6%) of which had low HL. Patients with low HL were more likely to be of a non-White race (37.5% vs 13.0%, p&lt;0.0001), and were more likely to have triple negative disease (16.9% vs 10.3%, p=0.03). Additionally, patients with low HL were more likely to have a high comorbidity burden, with 77.6% having &ge;2 comorbidities, compared to 62.7% in the high HL group (p=0.0003). These differences were accounted for by a higher rate of cardiac and vascular comorbidities (66.2% vs 50.2%, p=0.0006), and diabetes (29.9% vs 16.4%, p=0.004) in the low HL group. In regards to cardiac and vascular comorbidities, patients with low HL had higher rates of congestive heart failure, cerebral vascular disease, and hypertension.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The results of this study establish a relationship between HL and comorbidities, particularly cardiac/vascular disease and diabetes, in breast cancer patients. HL is an actionable social determinant of health in the delivery of patient-centered cancer care. Future research should be conducted to determine: (1) the impact of HL and comorbidity and (2) the efficacy of HL-specific tailored interventions on breast oncologic outcomes.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive tumor subtype with poor prognosis. Prior studies have identified disparities in outcomes for patients with TNBC based on race, access to care, and molecular features. We sought to determine whether age also contributes to disparity in TNBC, hypothesizing that younger patients receive more comprehensive treatment, potentially resulting in survival differences.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The National Cancer Database was used to identify female patients with unilateral, invasive ER-/PR-/HER2- breast cancer treated 2005-2017. Patients were stratified by age (18-40, 41-70, 71-90); demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment factors were compared between groups. Logistic regression determined factors associated with surgery type, sequence of chemotherapy, and receipt of radiation. Survival outcomes were analyzed using a stratified log-rank test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

Of the 168,715 patients, 16,287 (9.6%) were &le;40, 117,201 (69.5%) were 41-70, and 35,227 (20.9%) were &ge; 71. Patients &le;40 presented at higher AJCC clinical stage (stage 3 &amp; 4 20.6% vs. 16.3% and 15.6%, p&lt;0.001) and with more lymph node positivity (37.3% vs. 27% and 21%, p&lt;0.001). Chemotherapy use decreased with increasing age (&le;40 93.9%, 41-70 85.2%, &ge; 71 44%, p&lt;0.001) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was utilized most often in the youngest age group (39.5% vs. 24.7% and 8.0%, p&lt;0.001). While nearly half of patients &ge; 40 were treated with lumpectomy, bilateral mastectomy was the most common surgery type for patients &le;40. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was also more frequently performed in patients &le;40 than older age groups (44.4% vs. 37.7% and 32.9%, p&lt;0.001) After adjusting for demographic, facility, and tumor factors, patients &le;40 were significantly more likely to undergo both NAC and mastectomy than those &gt;41 (OR 1.5, both p&lt;0.05). Conversely, patients &ge; 71 were less likely to receive radiation after lumpectomy and mastectomy (OR 0.3 and 0.6, both p&lt;0.05). Overall survival was significantly greater in all age groups after adjuvant chemotherapy vs. NAC or no chemotherapy (p&lt;0.001). Patients treated with mastectomy and ALND had inferior survival compared to those treated with partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy across all three age groups (p&lt;0.001). Radiation also conferred a significant survival benefit in all patients regardless of age (p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The clinical characteristics of TNBC differ significantly by age and likely drive treatment decisions such as timing of systemic therapy, surgery type, and radiation. While patients &le;40 present with more advanced disease and appropriately receive NAC, they also undergo more extensive surgery which does not yield a survival benefit. Further research is needed to determine if this disparity is due to oncologic factors such as age-related differences in response to NAC or patient and provider preferences.

Amin<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>The University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: On breast imaging, radial sclerosing lesions (RSL) can mimic invasive breast cancer (IBC). RSL identified on percutaneous biopsy (CNB) are frequently recommended for surgical excision due to the risk of upgrade to underlying malignancy. Risk of upgrade to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or IBC has historically been up to 40%. More recently, active monitoring has been offered to patients with small, well sampled RSL not involved by atypical hyperplasia (AH) due to contemporary studies identifying upgrade rate of &lt;2%. Because which group of patients benefits from surgical excision of RSL remains controversial, the objective of our study was to define our institutional upgrade rate for RSL after multidisciplinary review. Additionally, we sought to identify factors associated with increased risk of upgrade to guide future recommendations for who should proceed to excision and who may be safely monitored.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A prospective database of benign and high-risk breast lesions identified on CNB at our institution was queried. Of the 1521 entries, 217 (14.3%) cases of RSL were identified in 204 patients over the study period of 2/2015-11/2020. All CNB identifying RSL underwent multidisciplinary review at Benign and High-Risk Breast Concordance Conference for management recommendations. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-square and Fisher&rsquo;s exact tests. Continuous variables were analyzed using t-tests and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Mean age at diagnosis for RSL was 56 years (SD 12.4). The majority of RSL were screen-detected imaging abnormalities (n=205, 94.5%) presenting as architectural distortion, mass, focal asymmetry, or calcifications on mammogram and mass or non-mass enhancement on MRI. Median imaging size was 1.3 cm and the majority had &gt;50% of the target excised by biopsy. RSL was involved by AH in 13 (6.0%). Patients had an ipsilateral concurrent BC in 19 (8.8%) and a contralateral concurrent BC in 23 (10.6%). 54.3% of the cohort underwent surgical excision of the RSL site and 45.7% had active monitoring. Surgical excision was significantly more common in patients with a concurrent BC, RSL involved by AH, and for larger RSL imaging size. From the excision cohort, 2 (2.9%) were diagnosed with DCIS at the RSL site on final pathology. Upgrade to DCIS was significantly associated with RSL involved by AH (p=0.02). Over the mean follow up of 23 months, additional CNB was recommended in 16 undergoing active monitoring, 6 at RSL biopsy site. No CNB at the RSL site identified a missed malignancy.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:Active monitoring for small, well-sampled RSL without AH can safely occur without concern for missing underlying malignancy. Due to low upgrade rate for RSL, surgical de-escalation could be explored to decrease the rate of benign excision, as the only risk for upgrade in this cohort was the presence of AH involving the RSL. All RSL without AH should be considered for active monitoring after multidisciplinary review.

At the Preventive Care Program for Women&rsquo;s Cancer Clinic at UAB (UABPC), multidisciplinary staff provide women at increased risk for breast cancer specialized preventive care via a comprehensive risk assessment with resultant recommendations for screening and management strategies. In 2011, several provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated cost sharing of basic women&rsquo;s preventive screening programs for patients with non-grandfathered health insurance plans. This increased affordability and accessibility of care for millions of Americans and increased awareness of racial disparities in preventive care. In this study, we examined the potential influence of these provisions on increasing total and minority patient participation in specialized preventive services in the UABPC.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients seen in this clinic were consented and data was collected to understand use of preventative services. 2003-2011 was designated as the pre-ACA enactment period and 2011-2019 as the post-ACA enactment period. We further subdivided patients&rsquo; enrollment dates in the clinic into 4-year periods to more closely assess trends in total and minority patient participation as a function of ACA implementation. Patients&rsquo; age, race, first clinic date, and socioeconomic status (SES) were considered for their impact on uptake of services pre and post-ACA.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Between 2003-2019, 2,786 patients were entered into this database. From 2003-2011, minority patients comprised 6.4% of clinic patients and between 2011-2019 minority clinic patients nearly tripled to comprise 18.6% of all patients seen. We conducted an overall Chi- Square analysis of patients seen in this clinic by race pre- and post-ACA, demonstrating a significant increase in total and minority patients with a p value&lt;.0001. An overall Chi-Square analysis of patients by race among the aforementioned 4 year time-periods also demonstrated a significant increase in patients between 2007-2011 and 2011-2015 with a p value&lt;.0001.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:We demonstrate a change in uptake of our clinic&rsquo;s preventive services and specifically changes to the racial makeup of the patient population following ACA implementation. The resultant reduced cost sharing for women&rsquo;s preventive screening and federal advancement of the Offices of Minority Health are plausible factors in the statistically significant increase in preventive service usage and in total and minority patient enrollment within the UABPC. These results underscore the value of federal programs that decrease racial disparities in healthcare and increase access to preventive care for women at an increased breast cancer risk.

Notably, Black women and those living in neighborhoods of lower socioeconomic status have the highest rates of TNBC. These populations are also more likely to be uninsured or Medicaid insured which portends later stages of diagnosis, lower rates of receipt of cancer-directed therapy, and higher mortality rates. Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has reduced the rate of uninsured patients and the incidence of advanced-stage breast cancer, especially among minority patients. The objective of this study was to examine rates of surgical delay among patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer during Medicaid expansion.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This National Cancer Database study included patients eligible for Medicaid, ages 40-64 years, diagnosed with clinical stage I or II estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, and HER-2 receptor-negative (triple-negative) breast cancer. The study included patients in non-expansion states and patients from states that expanded Medicaid in January 2014. Pre-expansion (pre-ACA) was defined as 2010-2013 and post-expansion (post-ACA) was from 2014-2017. Patients were grouped by race: non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White. Surgical delay was defined as the time from diagnosis to surgery greater than 60 days. Bivariate intergroup analyses were performed. Changes in rates of surgical delay were assessed with difference-in-difference analyses. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 5,469 patients met the study criteria, 3,005 White and 2,464 Black. In the pre-ACA period, 2,794 patients were diagnosed, and 2,675 patients were diagnosed in the post-ACA period. Black patients were diagnosed at a later cancer stage, had more comorbidities, higher rates of surgical delay, and lower rates of breast reconstruction and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy compared to White patients (all P&lt;0.001). In expansion states, Black patients had higher rates of surgical delay (pre-ACA 27.5%, post-ACA 32.8%) than their White counterparts (pre-ACA 17.0%, post-ACA 23.4%). Similarly, in non-expansion states, Black patients had higher rates of surgical delay (pre-ACA 25.6%, post-ACA 31.1%) than White patients (pre-ACA 16.5%, post-ACA 25.4%). On difference-in-difference analysis, surgical delay was significantly higher in the post-ACA period (2014-2017) for both White and Black patients but only in non-expansion states (P&lt;0.001). In difference-in-difference models, Black race was not significantly associated with delay in surgery after ACA implementation.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this evaluation of early-stage TNBC breast cancer patients Medicaid expansion did not mitigate disparities in surgical delay. These findings are deeply concerning as Black women continue to face poor outcomes from breast cancer despite significant improvements in diagnosis and treatment.

However, complication rates and resource use for these procedures have yet to be characterized at the national level. The present study aimed to evaluate rates of reintervention, mortality, complications and resource use for PC and SD.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adults undergoing PC or SD for pericardial effusion or tamponade were identified in the 2016-2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Patients with traumatic injury or undergoing other cardiac operations were excluded. Patients were grouped by initial treatment strategy as PC or SD. Reinterventions were identified within 30 days of initial procedure and PC and SD on the same day were considered conversions. The primary outcome of interest was reintervention, while secondary endpoints included in-hospital mortality, perioperative complications, total duration of hospitalization and overall costs. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used to visualize freedom from repeat intervention across cohorts.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of an estimated 30,017 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 60.9% underwent PC for initial management. Patients undergoing PC and SD were of similar age (63&plusmn;16 years vs 62&plusmn;15 years) and had similar burden of comorbidities as defined by the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (5.0&plusmn;2.4 vs 5.1&plusmn;2.3). The most common etiologies of effusion were malignancy (PC 27.3% and SD 26.9%), autoimmune disease (22.0% and 21.8%) and pericarditis (10.4% and 10.1%), while the remaining were considered idiopathic (40.3% and 41.2%). Relative to SD, patients undergoing PC had higher reintervention rates (11.3% vs 2.7%, p&lt;0.001, Figure) and unadjusted rates of mortality (14.8% vs 11.9%, p&lt;0.001) compared to SD. Of the reinterventions, 23.0% were conversions. After risk adjustment, PC patients remained at significantly increased odds for reintervention (Adjusted odds ratio: 4.8, p&lt;0.001). PC was also associated with increased mortality (14.8% vs 11.9%, p&lt;0.001), accidental puncture (3.8% vs 1.7%, p&lt;0.001) and cardiac arrest (6.1% vs 4.0%, p&lt;0.001), despite similar likelihood of hemorrhage (1.5% vs 1.9%, p=0.13) and stroke (0.1% vs 0.2%, p=0.18) relative to SD. Overall, PC was associated with a shorter duration of hospitalization (-2.6 days, 95% CI: -3.1 to -2.0) and lower costs (-$7,700, 95% CI: -$10,200 to -$5,200).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Initial treatment of pericardial effusion with pericardiocentesis is associated with greater odds of mortality, complications and reintervention, but lower resource use compared to surgical drainage. Individual patient factors merit careful consideration in choice of optimal treatment strategy in the management of pericardial effusion.

Ibrahim<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan, Surgery, Ann Arbor, MI, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine, Surgery, New Haven, CT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Health Professional Shortage Areas were created by the Health Resources and Services Administration to identify communities with a shortage of clinical providers. For medical conditions, these designations are associated with worse outcomes and patients often travel further for care. However, far less is known about high-risk procedures, such as coronary artery bypass, and how patients living in these communities do after that procedure. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Cross-sectional review of 401,623 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery between 2014-2018 were stratified based on whether they lived in a zip code designated as a Health Professional Shortage Area. Patient outcomes for 30-day mortality and readmissions were risk-adjusted using a multivariable logistic regression model for both patient (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities, year) and hospital characteristics (e.g., number of beds, geographic region, teaching status). Patient travel time and distance were then measured based on the time required to travel from the beneficiary&rsquo;s home zip code to the hospital address. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 401,623 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, 33,773 (8.4%) were identified to live in a Health Professional Shortage Area. Beneficiaries who lived in these designated areas were found to experience similar 30-day mortality (3.86% vs 3.69%; OR=0.96, 95% CI 0.96-0.96; p&lt;0.001) and readmission rates (15.00% vs 14.84%; OR=0.99, 95% CI 0.99-0.99; p&lt;0.001). Although beneficiaries in both groups experienced similar post-operative outcomes, there was a difference in overall travel burden. For example, the majority of beneficiaries living in Health Professional Shortage Areas were more likely to travel over 60 minutes from their home to the hospital compared to patients who did not live in these areas (45.7% vs 18.0%; p&lt;0.001). Similarly, patients in these shortage areas also traveled further distances (84.7 miles vs 59.4 miles; p&lt;0.001). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Medicare beneficiaries living in designated Health Professional Shortage Areas undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery experienced similar 30-day mortality and readmission outcomes, but took on significantly greater travel burden. These findings demonstrate important tradeoffs of centralizing high-risk procedures that could potentially be mitigated by adoption of perioperative low-travel delivery strategies (e.g. local care coordination, telehealth appointments, remote monitoring) across episodes of care.

Benharash<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>David Geffen School Of Medicine, University Of California At Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Safety-net hospitals (SNH) care for a high proportion of uninsured/underinsured patients with the mission of improving access to care within the community. Patients in this setting may lack access to adequate longitudinal care such as anticoagulation monitoring following mechanical heart valve operations. The present study characterized the association of SNH with utilization of mechanical valves in aortic valve replacement (AVR). Additionally, we evaluated the impact of mechanical aortic valve utilization on readmissions and stroke at high-burdened SNH centers.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried for all isolated AVR from 2016-2018. Hospitals were divided into quartiles based on annual volume of Medicaid and uninsured admissions, with the highest quartile defined as SNH. Mixed-effects multivariable regression was used to determine factors associated with mechanical valve use at a center-level. Among patients at SNH, multivariable regressions were used to determine associations between prosthesis type and outcomes of interest including in-hospital mortality, index length of stay, costs, 90-day readmissions and stroke at readmission.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of an estimated 135,930 AVR patients included in analysis, 15.9% underwent operations at SNH. Patients at SNH were younger (62 vs 64 years, P&lt;0.001) and more frequently received mechanical valves (21.9% vs 18.1%, P&lt;0.001) compared to patients at non-SNH, despite a similar burden of comorbidities as measured by the Elixhauser comorbidity index (4.9 vs 4.9, P=0.12). Hospital safety net status, female sex and preexisting peripheral vascular disease were among factors associated with increased odds of mechanical valve use (C-statistic=0.73), while increasing age, preexisting liver disease and coagulopathy showed decreased odds (Table). Among patients at SNH, recipients of mechanical valves had higher rates of 90-day readmissions (14.9% vs 13.0%, P&lt;0.001) and stroke at readmission (0.7% vs 0.2%, P&lt;0.001) compared to recipients of biological prostheses. After adjustment, mechanical valve use was still associated with higher odds of readmission at 90-days (AOR 1.20, 95%CI:1.04&ndash;1.39) and stroke at readmission (AOR 3.48, 95%CI:1.87&ndash;6.46) compared to bioprosthetic valves, despite similar in-hospital mortality, costs and length of stay.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Hospital safety-net status is associated with increased odds of mechanical valve use over biologic prostheses. However, mechanical valves are also associated with increased readmissions and stroke for patients undergoing AVR in this setting. These findings may help to highlight socioeconomic barriers that may prevent adequate access to follow-up care following aortic valve replacement.

We analyzed the characteristics of patients who developed new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) following robotic-assisted video-thoracoscopic (RAVT) pulmonary lobectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively analyzed 709 patients who underwent RAVT pulmonary lobectomy by one surgeon over 10.7 years. After 131 patients were excluded due to preoperative history of atrial fibrillation or use of steroids or immunosuppressants, 578 patients were grouped based on the presence or absence of new-onset POAF. Age, preoperative comorbidities, perioperative blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine (Cr) ratios, perioperative leukocyte counts, postoperative prealbumin levels, intraoperative and postoperative complications, chest tube duration, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were compared by t-test, Chi-squared, or Kruskal-Wallis tests, with p&le;0.05 as significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 578 study patients, 76 patients developed new-onset POAF. On average, patients who developed POAF were older (p&lt;0.0001) and had a higher incidence of preoperative hypertension (p=0.0233), preoperative hyperlipidemia (p=0.0278), and postoperative anemia (p=0.007). POAF patients had a higher rate of intraoperative complications (p=0.0314). Lowest postoperative prealbumin levels were lower (p=0.0032) and peak postoperative leukocyte counts were higher in the new-onset POAF group (p=0.0187). Additionally, POAF patients experienced higher peak inpatient postoperative BUN:Cr values (p&lt;0.0001). New-onset POAF patients had a longer chest tube duration (p=0.0002) and hospital LOS (p&lt;0.0001) and had decreased median survival (p=0.0102). Multivariable analysis found peak inpatient postoperative BUN:Cr (p&lt;0.0001), lowest inpatient postoperative prealbumin (p&lt;0.0001), and postoperative anemia (p=0.0102) to be independent predictors of increased hospital LOS. Additionally, lowest inpatient postoperative prealbumin was found to independently predict POAF (p=0.0263).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients with new-onset POAF had a substantial perioperative inflammatory burden characterized by preoperative hypertension, postoperative leukocytosis, decreased prealbumin, and elevated postoperative BUN:Cr. Consequently, POAF patients had a prolonged LOS and reduced survival. BUN:Cr and prealbumin levels should be followed throughout the perioperative clinical course and the latter treated by protein supplementation, as reduced prealbumin may forecast POAF. Furthermore, patients at risk of new-onset POAF may require close monitoring for possible prophylaxis or treatment to minimize morbidity.

LeMaire<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Baylor College Of Medicine, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The immediate postoperative outcomes of open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair are well described and characterized by significant morbidity and mortality. However, among the patients who survive to discharge after TAAA repair, there is a subset who do not survive beyond the first postoperative year. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors associated with one-year mortality after surviving the perioperative phase.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Of 3,677 open TAAA repairs performed at a single center between 1986 and 2021, 3,367 patients (91.6%) survived the initial perioperative period. We performed a retrospective analysis of these survivors and reviewed patient demographics, preoperative characteristics, operative details, and postoperative complications, including life-altering complications (LACs). LACs were defined as persistent stroke, paraparesis, paraplegia, or renal failure requiring dialysis. A logistic regression model was created to predict risk of one-year mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 3,367 survivors, 301 patients (8.9%) died during the first postoperative year. On univariate analysis, patients that died were older (median age, 71 years [65-76] vs. 66 years [57-72], p&lt;0.001) and more frequently had acute symptoms (24.3% vs. 15.1%, p&lt;0.001). Although the need for urgent or emergency repair was associated with increased one-year mortality (32.9% vs. 20.2%, p&lt;0.001), the extent of aortic replacement was not. LACs (20.3% vs. 6.0%, p&lt;0.001) and infection (19.9% vs 8.0%, p&lt;0.001) were among the postoperative factors associated with one-year mortality. Additional comparisons are presented in Table 1. The logistic regression model accurately estimated 91.5% of outcomes and revealed predictors of one-year mortality including increasing age (OR=1.03/year, p&lt;0.001), prior myocardial infarction (MI, OR=1.67, p&lt;0.001), cerebrovascular disease (CVD, OR=1.41, p=0.03), chronic kidney disease (CKD, OR=1.38, p=0.03), and rupture (OR=1.68, p=0.02). Predictive postoperative factors included pulmonary complications (OR=1.56, p=0.004), LACs (OR=1.52, p=0.047), longer intensive care unit stay (ICU, OR=1.02/day, p&lt;0.001), and non-home discharge (OR=2.10, p&lt;0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: TAAA repair carries substantial one-year mortality, even after surviving the perioperative phase. Our data suggest that older patients, those with a history of MI, CVD, or CKD, or present with rupture, have increased risk of mortality within 1 year. Pulmonary complications, LACs, and longer ICU stay contribute to increased one-year mortality. Discharging patients home was a strong indicator of one-year survival. For patients with one or more of these factors, more rigorous postoperative monitoring may improve overall survival.

Benharash<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>David Geffen School Of Medicine, University Of California At Los Angeles, Department Of Surgery, Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Individuals with prior kidney transplantation (KTx) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Although institutional series have reported acceptable outcomes for cardiac surgery in those with KTx, national studies remain limited. The present study assessed the association of prior KTx with in-hospital mortality, complications, resource utilization and readmissions following elective cardiac operation in a nationally representative cohort.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

All adults undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting, valve repair/replacement or a combination thereof were identified in the 2010-18 Nationwide Readmissions Database. History of KTx as well as other patient and hospital characteristics were tabulated utilizing International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions. In addition, KTx-capable institutions were defined as those performing at least one kidney transplant annually. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality while secondary outcomes included rate of perioperative complications and 30-day readmission as well as length of stay (LOS) and costs. Accounting for patient and hospital characteristics, multivariable regression models were developed to assess the independent association between KTx status and outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 1,408,582 patients included for analysis, 0.2% (n=2,852) had a history of KTx. Compared to their counterparts, KTx recipients were on average younger (60.5 vs 66.3 years, P&lt;0.001) but had a higher burden of comorbidities as measured by the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (5.1 vs 4.0, P&lt;0.001). After risk adjustment, KTx was associated with increased mortality and perioperative complications, notably postoperative infection and new-onset hemodialysis (Figure). In addition, KTx recipients had longer LOS (9.8 vs 8.3 days, P&lt;0.001) and incurred higher costs (53,371 vs $46,395, P&lt;0.001). KTx was associated with greater odds of readmission within 30 days (Figure). On subpopulation analysis of KTx recipients, those undergoing operations at centers with KTx capability had significantly reduced odds of new-onset hemodialysis (Odds Ratio 0.65, 95% Confidence Interval 0.44-0.98, P=0.039) but similar mortality compared to patients treated at other institutions.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Patients with prior KTx undergoing cardiac surgery face significantly increased risk of postoperative mortality and complications following cardiac operations. This association is partially mitigated at hospitals with KTx expertise. Our findings have implications in referral of KTx patients to specialized centers for cardiac surgical care.

As underlying mechanism(s) continue to be identified, stakeholder perspectives are needed to inform development of interventions. We therefore aimed to develop an action plan to address racial disparities in surgery and IBD through patient, caregiver, and provider perspectives.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Two phases of stakeholder engagement were conducted. In the first phase, three levels of stakeholders were recruited for focus groups and interviews: Black patients with IBD who had undergone surgery, caregivers of Black IBD patients, and providers who deliver IBD care at a single-institution. Semi-structured interviews were used to explored barriers and facilitators to a positive, or negative, surgical experience with a focus on ways to improve care. Transcripts were coded and thematically analyzed with NVivo12 software. In the second phase, a separate panel of patients, caregivers, and providers were recruited and iteratively engaged to synthesize an action plan to address racial disparities in IBD surgical care.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In the first phase, seventeen IBD patients participated in 12 focus group sessions, 4 caregivers participated in 1 focus group session, and 10 providers were individually interviewed. Major themes to positive and negative surgical experiences were identified and grouped into &ldquo;Pre-operative Experiences&rdquo; and &ldquo;Post-operative Experiences&rdquo;. In the second phase, 6 iterative meetings were conducted with a panel of patients, caregivers, and providers to synthesize findings and to develop an action plan. Key strategies were established: 1. Promote awareness about IBD, 2. Ensure early caregiver involvement, 3. Establish a database of IBD information, 4. Promote early conversation about surgical options, 5. Ensure visual ostomy education is available, 6. Promote peer-peer partnerships, 7. Establish treatment goals, 8. Ensure patients are involved with hospital technology, 9. Appoint a patient navigator specific for IBD care, and 10. Ensure disparities are timely assessed.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study highlights a potential 10-step action plan to improve the surgical experience for Black patients with IBD. These stakeholder-informed strategies are patient-centered and should be incorporated into current surgical care in IBD.

Smelser<sup>1</sup>, D. Carey<sup>1</sup>, R. L. Hoffman<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, PENNSYLVANIA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Originally thought to be a disease related to diet, recent studies have shown strong evidence that genetic factors play a significant role in the pathophysiology of diverticular disease. Three genome wide association studies on diverticular disease have been able to identify candidate genetic coding regions associated with the disease. A prior study using the DiscovEHR MyCode biobank identified rare loss of function variants within these candidate regions. The aim of this study was to identify novel familial subtypes of diverticular disease using the whole exome sequencing data and to confirm these findings using electronic health record data.Introduction:

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All patients of European ancestry who were enrolled in the MyCode biobanking program were included. Diverticular disease cases were identified in the EHR using ICD-9 and 10 codes. Controls were defined as individuals with no history of diverticular disease. Rare coding variants were identified in the ARHGAP15, COLQ, FAM155A, ABO, and ANO1 genes. Patients with identified rare coding variants were then compared using genomic data to identify degrees of relation which was then confirmed with patient demographic information. Two separate family pedigrees for inherited diverticular disease were reconstructed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 131,943 patients were included in our analysis of which 16,394 (12%) had diverticular disease. Of the genes studied, eight different rare coding variants on the COLQ gene were identified in a total of 56 patients, 31 of which had a clinical diagnosis of diverticular disease (odds ratio of 8.77). Two of these variants were found in patients that shared close familial relationship and pedigrees for these two families were reconstructed. The first pedigree (stop gained variant, 3:15458296:T:A) showed 50% inheritance, 2 of 4 siblings with disease. The second pedigree (stop gained variant, 3:15474005:G:A) showed 100% inheritance, 3 of 3 siblings with disease.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: This study identified families with shared rare coding variants strongly associated with diverticular disease and after reconstructing these families into pedigrees, these rare variants appear to be associated with strong inheritance of disease. This suggests new familial subtypes of diverticular disease with high transmission between family members. This study also demonstrates the ability to link family members and evaluate disease inheritance and phenotypic presentation by starting with genomic data alone. This method is a breakthrough in the study of late onset heritable diseases like diverticular disease and will be a key to early detection of disease in high risk families.

The Risk Analysis Index (RAI) has been applied to various surgical populations as an objective way to assist in predicting surgical outcomes. In this analysis we compare the effectiveness of RAI to predict 30-day mortality in patients undergoing colectomy with or without cancer within the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) database.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively analyzed the VASQIP database for patients undergoing colectomies from 2000-2020. All patients were divided between the groups of no diagnosis associated with cancer vs diagnosis associated with cancer. Demographics, comorbidities, and 30 day outcomes were compared. RAI was applied to both groups and the ROC and C-statistic were calculated for the prediction of 30-day mortality.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 63,448 colectomy patients from 2000-2020 were included in the analysis. 32,783 of these had a post-operative diagnosis ICD code associated with cancer and 30,665 did not. Patients with non-cancer post-operative codes were more likely to undergo a laparoscopic approach (24.10% vs 21.90%, p&lt;0.001) or have emergency surgery (21.30% vs 2.60%). Patients with cancer associated post-operative codes had lower 30-day mortality (2.70% vs 4.90%, p&lt;0.001), complication rate (24.50% vs 27.30%, p&lt;0.001), and return to OR within 30 days (9.4% vs 11.6%, p&lt;0.001). RAI was superior in predicting 30-day mortality in patients without a cancer associated post-operative code (C-statistic 0.833, 95% CI 0.822-0.844) than in cases associated with cancer (C-statistic 0.713, 95% CI 0.695-0.730).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: RAI is a frailty scoring system that is easy to administer and is effective at predicting mortality in some populations. RAI worked well in the cancer-associated group and non-cancer group. However, RAI was significantly better at predicting 30-day mortality in patients undergoing surgery for non-malignant pathologies.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to perform a retrospective review of uninsured and Medicaid patients in the lowest income quartile (median annual income &lt;$40,227) diagnosed with colon cancer in the pre- (2010-2013) and post- (2014-2016) Medicaid expansion periods. A quasi-experimental, difference-in-differences (DID) design was used to determine the effects of healthcare reform for patients in expansion states compared to those in non-expansion states. Associations with uninsured rate and stage of presentation were analyzed using logistic regression, and associations with overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 7,334 patients evaluated, 1,156 (15.8%) in 2010-13 and 1,423 (19.4%) in 2014-16 resided in expansion states, and 2,592 (35.3%) in 2010-2013 and 1,763 (24.0%) in 2014-16 resided in non-expansion states. Following expansion, the proportion of uninsured patients decreased by 67.0% in expansion states, from 34.8% to 11.5% (p&lt;0.01), and by 8.2% in non-expansion states, from 55.5% to 50.9% (p&lt;0.01). In the pre-expansion period, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients presenting with localized (pathologic stage I/II) colon cancer between patients residing in expansion compared to those in non-expansion states (41.5% expansion vs. 39.0% non-expansion, p=0.12). However, following expansion, patients residing in expansion states were significantly more likely to present with localized colon cancer than were patients in non-expansion states (42.2% vs. 35.9%, p&lt;0.01). Parallel trends after risk adjustment were confirmed by regressing the interaction between expansion status and diagnosis year using pre-expansion data on insurance status (p=0.912), stage of presentation (p=0.496), and 3-year OS (p=0.265). Following risk-adjustment using multivariate regression analysis, Medicaid expansion was associated with a significant decrease in uninsured status (odds ratio [OR] 0.26, p&lt;0.001) and increase in presentation with stage I/II disease (OR 1.26, p=0.042), but was not associated with a difference in 3-year OS (hazard ratio 1.15, p=0.158) (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although Medicaid expansion has led to lower uninsured rates and earlier-stage colon cancer diagnoses among low SES patients, a high proportion of these patients still remain uninsured in expansion states. Further efforts are needed to lower this rate across all states to ensure patients are diagnosed with colon cancer in a timely fashion when curative interventions can be performed.

More comprehensive, functional, and efficient assessment tools are needed. This study&rsquo;s objective was to develop and assess for the acceptability and feasibility of a comprehensive survey to evaluate key psychosocial health determinants in colorectal surgery patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This study was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, a systematic review of validated psychosocial health surveys was used to identify instruments from existing literature and the NIH PhenX Toolkit. In the second phase, a modified Delphi method was used to address the length, clarity, appropriateness, redundancy, and fitness of each instrument in the survey. A comprehensive survey was then finalized. In the third and final phase, the survey was tested for acceptability and feasibility on adult colorectal patients (outpatient and inpatient) using a theory-guided framework. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to evaluate relationships between survey responses and measures of acceptability and feasibility.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In the first phase, 30 instruments (217 questions) were identified. In the second phase, this initial compilation was refined, and a comprehensive survey was finalized. The finished product included 18 instruments (58 questions) which collectively assessed for details at each level of the socioecological model and key psychosocial health determinants like health literacy, patient activation, and physician trust. In phase 3, the finalized survey was administered to patients in three settings (inpatient, clinical, and waiting room). The recruitment period lasted 6 days, and 28 of 31 eligible patients completed the survey. 85.7% of participants agreed that other patients would have no trouble completing the survey and 82.1% of respondents reported that the survey was not at all burdensome. 96.4% of patients reported they had enough time to complete the survey and 85.7% agreed that the survey was well-integrated into their appointment. High health literacy scores were correlated with lower reported burden (p=0.01). Higher income was negatively correlated with both demand for the survey (p=0.005) and reported appropriateness of being asked about social and economic needs (p=0.04).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study successfully developed a comprehensive survey to measure key psychosocial determinants of health among adult colorectal surgery patients. This work lays a path for better understanding the socioecological environment in which vulnerable patients live to better understand and address disparities in surgery.

The purpose of this study was to identify patient, surgical, and hospital factors associated with positive margins following colorectal cancer surgery in Michigan. These factors may serve as potential targets to focus statewide efforts and improve surgical care for colorectal cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective analysis of a prospective statewide clinical registry was performed using 2016-2020 data from 42 hospital sites that perform colorectal cancer surgery. Demographic, hospital, and surgical characteristics were compared based on their associated positive margin rates. P-values were generated using either Pearson Chi-Square test or a two-tailed t-test to determine significance of association between positive margin rate and corresponding factors. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize and present associated factors against positive margin rate. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the study period, 4,211 cases occurred, and the average positive margin rate was 6.2%. When stratified by surgical subtype, 5.9% of colon cancer cases and 7.7% of rectal cancer cases resulted in positive margins. 10 sites had a margin positivity rate &lt;3%, 13 sites had a rate between 3-6%, and 16 sites had a rate &gt;6%. Furthermore, there was marked variability in margin positivity, and this was not associated with hospital case volume (see Figure). Urgent/emergency cases had greater positive margin rates (colon = 10.2%; rectal = 25.0%) relative to those of elective cases (4.3%; 6.8%). Additionally, open surgical approaches had higher rates of margin positivity (8.9%; 11.8%) compared to those of laparoscopic/robotic approaches (3.4%; 5.6%). More advanced staging of colon and rectal cancers was associated with higher positive margin rates (colon T4 = 18.4%, N2 = 15.8%; rectal T4 = 39.5%, N2 = 17.5%) compared to the rates of earlier cancers (colon T0-T3 = 2.7%, N0-N1 = 4.2%; rectal T0-T3 = 5.0%, N0-N1 = 6.2%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study reveals significant variability in positive margin rates of colorectal cancer surgery by site in Michigan. Several institutions (both high and low case volume) achieved near-zero positive margins. The next step is to identify clinical best practices from these high-performing sites, and a state-based surgical quality collaborative will align financial incentives for surgeons and hospitals to achieve a statewide goal of 0% positive margins.

Johnson VAMC, Surgery, Charleston, SC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Postoperative fever following elective colectomy is common and often results reflexively in a comprehensive fever workup. However, the likelihood of a positive result or change in management related to fever workup in the enhanced recovery era is poorly defined. We hypothesized that a significant proportion of patients exists in which the comprehensive fever workup is of minimal utility and that common characteristics of this low-risk population may be identified based on data available at the time of the initial fever episode.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery at a single institution between 2015-2020. Those with postoperative fever &ge; 38.0&deg;C during admission were included. The primary outcome was a positive fever evaluation defined as an abnormal finding on chest radiography, computerized topography (CT) imaging, urinalysis, urine culture, or blood culture that led to a change in management such as initiation of antibiotics. Covariates with p-value &lt;0.001 [max temperature (T-max) &ge;38.5&deg; C, documented symptoms of potential infection, and the presence of other vital sign changes indicative of systematic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)] were combined into an additive risk score from 0-3. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the odds of infection with the risk score entered as a binary variable (0-1 vs 2-3 risk factors).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 143 patients with postoperative fever, 27 had a positive evaluation (18.9%). Active smoking status (p=0.018), time from surgery to fever (p=0.002), T-max &ge;38.5&deg; C, other SIRS vitals, and documented symptoms (all, p &lt;0.001) were associated with an identifiable source of fever. The distribution of patients by risk score and the presence of an identifiable fever source is shown in Figure 1. On multivariable regression, patients with a risk factor score of 2-3 were more likely to have a positive fever evaluation compared to patients with 0 or 1 risk factor (OR 41.6, 95% CI: 8.8-197.6). The negative predictive value of score 0-1 was 97.6%. 44 patients with score 0-1 would require testing to identify one infection compared to 3 patients with score 2-3.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Of patients with postoperative fever after colectomy in the enhanced recovery era, a minority were associated with actionable infectious complications. These data suggest selective fever workup guided by the above risk score have the potential to limit unnecessary testing without compromising patient care. This simple &lsquo;two-hit&rsquo; model offers a straightforward and effective decision-support tool which may be validated in future studies.

Despite guidelines for treatment of colon cancer, prior studies have suggested insurance type and healthcare access are determinants of poor patient outcomes. To mitigate disparities, Medicaid expansion (ME) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act increased insurance coverage in states that adopted ME starting in 2014. This study examines the impact of ME on Stage 3 colon cancer patients in surgical treatment and outcomes, as compared to private insurance counterparts.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The American College of Surgeons National Cancer Database was used to examine an 8-year period surrounding ME. Hospitals were categorized based on percentages of states in Census Bureau divisions that adopted ME: low (0-33%), medium (34-66%), high (67-100%). Patients, ages 18-65, with private insurance or Medicaid, diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer and who received definitive resection surgery within 2010-2017, were included. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed to compare Medicaid to private insurance patients and among ME categories.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 30,918 private insurance and 5,142 Medicaid patients were included in this study. Middle and high ME divisions had increased number of surgical cases (Figure 1A) and adjuvant therapies (Figure 1B) after expansion. For surgical outcomes, there was a significant increase in proportion of cases that attained 12 or greater lymph node dissections in medium (87.7% vs 92.9%, p = 0.001) and high (90.6% vs 93.2%, p = 0.009) divisions after 2014. After ME, there was also an increase in rates of R0 resections in medium (86.0% vs 91.9%, p &lt; 0.001) and high (88.5% vs 91.5%, p=0.005) ME divisions. In these same surgical measures, the pre-ME disparities between private insurance and Medicaid patients were no longer significant post-ME in medium ME divisions. Similarly, 30-day mortality was non-inferior to private insurance in high and medium divisions post-ME, though significant disparity still remained between low ME populations and private insurance. The adjusted odds of 30-day mortality increased over 38 times post-ME (p = 0.026) compared to pre-ME for the low group.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Medicaid expansion significantly impacted surgical intervention for Stage 3 colon cancer. Overall, higher ME divisions and private insurance demonstrated better outcomes, which supports increasing health insurance coverage. Further study into the implications of ME and improved access to care on early diagnosis and treatment is necessary to further evaluate outcomes.

Cryoablation in pediatric cancer patients has not been well described. We hypothesize that cryoablation reduces opioid use in pediatric oncology patients undergoing thoracotomy.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An IRB-approved, retrospective chart review was performed for all oncology patients who underwent thoracotomy at a tertiary, freestanding children&rsquo;s hospital from 1/1/2017-5/31/2021. Measured outcomes included cumulative post-operative opioid use measured in morphine milligram equivalents per kilogram (MME/kg), pain scores scaled 0-10, and receipt of an opioid prescription at discharge. Univariate analysis compared patients who received cryoablation to patients who did not receive cryoablation. Controlling for age and prior thoracotomy, multivariable regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between cryoablation and post-operative opioid use and receipt of an opioid prescription at discharge.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 32 patients (19M:13F)(median age 15 years) underwent thoracotomy. The most common diagnoses were metastatic osteosarcoma (n=18, 56.3%), metastatic Ewing&rsquo;s sarcoma (n=4, 12.5%), pleuropulmonary blastoma (n=2, 6.3%), and metastatic Wilms tumor (n=2, 6.3%). Overall, 16/32 (50.0%) patients underwent &gt;1 thoracotomy; 53 thoracotomies were performed overall and included in our analysis. Cryoablation was used in 14/53 (26.4%) thoracotomies. Throughout the entire post-operative hospitalization, children receiving cryoablation had lower median opioid use compared to children who did not receive cryoablation (0.37 MME/kg, IQ range 0.20-1.0 MME/kg vs. 1.2 MME/kg, IQ range 0.57-2.6 MME/kg, p=0.01)(Figure). Median maximum daily pain scores were lower in cryoablation patients (median max=6; IQ range 5-8) than non-cryoablation patients (median max=8; IQ range 6-10), with significant difference first noted on postoperative day 4 (p=0.01). Children receiving cryoablation were less frequently prescribed opioids at discharge (21.4% vs. 61.5%, p=0.01). On multivariable regression analysis, cryoablation was associated with 1.83 MME/kg less postoperative opioid use (95% CI: -3.25, -0.14) and a decreased likelihood of receiving an opioid prescription at discharge (OR 0.14; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.64) compared to children who did not receive cryoablation.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Cryoablation significantly decreases post-thoracotomy pain and opioid use in pediatric oncology patients and should be considered as part of a multi-modal approach to post-operative pain management.

In children and young adults, initial management of spontaneous pneumothorax (PTX) must weigh risks of surgical management against the possibility of recurrence with conservative treatment. While institutional series have sought to define the role of early intervention, large scale analysis is lacking. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the impact of initial strategy on readmissions and resource utilization in a nationally-representative cohort.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 


Patients (10-20 years) admitted for spontaneous PTX were identified using the 2010-2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). To ensure adequate follow-up during the calendar year, those discharged before March and after October were omitted. Based upon initial management strategy, patients were subsequently classified as non-operative management (NOM), chest tube drainage only (CTD) and operative intervention (OP) (pleurodesis, blebectomy, decortication and lobectomy). Multivariable regression was used to evaluate the impact of approach on outcomes of interest. The primary outcome was PTX recurrence within the calendar year. Secondary outcomes included utilization of computed tomography of the thorax (CT) as well as cumulative hospitalization costs and length of stay within 90 days of index discharge. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to evaluate the impact of management strategy on PTX recurrence.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of an estimated 23,904 patients who met study criteria, 38.1% were classified as NOM, 32.7% as CTD and 29.2% as OP. Compared to others, the OP cohort was least commonly female (14.1% OP vs 26.1% NOM vs 19.5% CTD, p&lt;0.001) and least likely to have a history of tobacco use (7.9% OP vs 10.0% NOM vs 13.7% CTD, p&lt;0.001). However, these patients more frequently had Marfan&rsquo;s Syndrome (2.7% OP vs 0.7% NOM vs 0.7% CTD, p&lt;0.001) as well as emphysematous blebs (48.9% OP vs 1.8% NOM vs 2.5% CTD, p&lt;0.001). After adjustment, patients initially managed operatively experienced lower odds of PTX recurrence (AOR: 0.63, 95%CI: 0.50-0.79) while CTD had increased risk (AOR 1.86, 95%CI: 1.58-2.19) with NOM as reference (Figure). Adjusted rates of CT utilization as well as cumulative costs were similar among groups. However, CTD (&beta; +1.5 days, 95%CI: 0.7-2.3) and OP (&beta; +1.2 days, 95% CI 0.5-2.0) had higher incremental total LOS compared to NOM.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:


Initial operative management for first-time spontaneous PTX appears to reduce risk of recurrence while demonstrating similar costs in children and young adults. Due to high recurrence rates associated with non-operative and chest tube drainage approaches, surgical management as initial treatment should be considered in this patient population.

DeBakey Department Of Surgery, Houston, TEXAS, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common primary hepatic malignancy in childhood with survival approaching 80-90% in children with low and intermediate risk disease. Relapse occurs in more than 50% of high-risk patients with a high mortality due to ineffective salvage therapies. The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors for relapse in a single center tertiary referral center. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective chart review showed 22 patients that presented with relapsed HB from October 2004 to July 2020 at Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Houston, Texas. Relapse was defined as re-appearance of malignancy after 4 weeks of normalized AFP and disappearance of all tumors. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Relapsed HB was found to occur more often in males (72%) and children of Hispanic decent (57%). The patients with relapsed HB were initially diagnosed at an average age of 48 months (with interquantile range [IQR], 8 months &ndash; 138 months). Of the patients who relapsed, 27% of the patients were born prematurely. About half (45%) of the patients presented with pretreatment extent of disease stage (PRETEXT) IV disease involving all section of the liver. Relapsed HB occurred similarly in patients with multifocal disease (42%) compared to unifocal (47%). Disease involving all 3 hepatic veins or IVC (V+) or involving both portal veins or main portal vein (P+) on imaging was seen in 4% and 45%, respectively, of the initial tumors. Pathologic macro- and micro-vascular invasion were appreciated in 41% and 59%, respectively, of the initial tumors resected within the relapse group. Metastatic disease was appreciated in 32% of patients on initial presentation. The average time from resection to relapse was 6.4 months (IQR, one month &ndash; eighteen months). Relapsed tumors more commonly occurred in the lung (59%) versus liver (36%). Eighteen percent of patients had multiple relapses. After a median follow-up time of thirty months, 40% of patients were salvaged with surgery and/or chemotherapy.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study revealed prevalent characteristics of the relapse HB population including PRETEXT IV disease, portal vein (P+) involvement, pathologic microvascular invasion, and occurrence of disease in the lung. Salvage rates of relapse HB remains below 50% at a tertiary referral center emphasizing the need for further study of this high-risk population to improve outcomes.

Line fractures and complete transections are an unfortunate but well recognized complication of CVC care. Treatment options after CVC damage are limited to either repair or complete replacement but the comparison of these interventions has been poorly studied and outcomes are mixed. We contend that repairing a broken CVC does not confer a greater risk of bacteremia to that of complete replacement.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of all pediatric patients at a single, quaternary children&rsquo;s hospital who underwent repair or replacement of a damaged tunneled CVC from January 2018 to September 2020 was performed (IRB #10440). Data collected included patient demographics, dwell protocol, intervention (repair vs replace), and duration of time from catheter break to intervention. Outcomes evaluated were bacteremia (defined as positive blood cultures) and incidence of recurrent catheter malfunction within 60 days following the intervention. 

P-values were calculated using Fisher&rsquo;s exact test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. Separate logistic regression models were fit to estimate the effects that replacement/repair had on outcomes. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 89 line-breaks in 48 unique patients were identified during the timeframe. 70 of the lines were repaired at bedside and 19 were replaced in the operating room (Table 1). Of the 70 repair attempts, 5 were unsuccessful and required replacement due to lumen occlusion or continued leak at repair site. These five patients were excluded from analysis due to their cross-over intervention. 

Patients who underwent line replacement showed significantly higher odds of developing bacteremia compared to patients who had their line repaired (31.6% vs 9.2%; OR [95%CI] = 4.82 [1.25, 18.53]; p=0.002). The average time from break to intervention was significantly higher in the replacement group compared to the repair group (19.4 vs. 7.9 hours, p&lt;0.0001). 

There was no difference in recurrent mechanical complications between catheters that were repaired versus replaced (OR [95%CI] = 0.18 [0.03, 1.18]; p=0.074). Receiving ethanol dwells did not result in a decrease in bacteremia complications (p=0.059). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Repairing a damaged central venous catheter is a safe and effective treatment for pediatric patients. Successful repair results in a decreased incidence of bacteremia while also avoiding the risks associated with an operation to replace the CVC, including that of anesthesia and risk of loss of venous access sites.

There is limited data regarding which approach leads to better long-term control. Our objective was to evaluate long-term recurrence rates following pleurectomy or mechanical pleurodesis for recurrent PSP.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The PearlDiver Mariner Database was queried for patients ages 10-25 who presented with PSP and underwent either pleurectomy or mechanical pleurodesis between 2010-2020. This database provides national all-payer patient claims data with the ability to capture longitudinal patient follow-up data. Outcomes included recurrence rates, length of stay, opioid prescriptions at discharge up to 30 days, and reimbursement. Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used with adjustment for age and gender.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 18,955 patients that had PSP, 5.1% (n=968) were managed operatively with either pleurectomy (18.3%, n=177) or mechanical pleurodesis (81.7%, n=791). There was no difference in the rate of recurrence between pleurectomy as compared to mechanical pleurodesis (5-year risk of recurrence: 25.8% vs 26.5%, adjusted hazard ratio=1.12 [95% confidence interval: 0.79, 1.58]) (Figure 1). There was no difference in median length of stay (6 days vs 6 days, p=0.33) or rate of outpatient opioid prescription (49.2% vs 52.8%, p=0.58) between pleurectomy and mechanical pleurodesis, respectively. Median reimbursement was higher following pleurectomy compared to pleurodesis ($14,040 vs. $5,811, p=0.02).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is no significant difference in recurrence based on type of procedure performed for recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax. However, pleurectomy is associated with higher costs. This may be due to increased pain necessitating additional inpatient therapy. Given similar outcomes but substantially higher costs associated with pleurectomy, mechanical pleurodesis may be considered a superior therapy.

Given the negative clinical effects opiates can have in infants, including diminished bowel motility and respiratory suppression, the search for alternative forms of analgesia that are equipotent in controlling post-operative pain continues. We implemented an opiate reduction strategy centered around standing intravenous (IV) acetaminophen for infants under 1 year old undergoing gastrointestinal surgery being treating on the acute care floor.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Our intervention focused on giving infants standing IV acetaminophen every 6 hours for a minimum of 48 hours as the main form of post-operative analgesia. Pain severity was objectively scored by registered nurses using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale. A before-and-after retrospective cohort analysis was performed and process control charts were utilized to examine trends in post-operative opiate use in our Pre-Intervention (January 2012- January 2016) and Post-Intervention (December 2016- December 2020) cohorts. Data from the Roll-out group (January 2016- December 2016) was included in tables and process control charts for comparison.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 131 infants were included in the study: 56 in the pre-intervention group, 17 in the roll-out group, and 58 in the post-intervention group. Patient demographics were similar among the pre- and post-intervention cohorts. The intervention successfully led to a 36-fold reduction in cumulative post-operative morphine equivalents (median 0.36 mg/kg in the pre-intervention group vs. 0.0 mg/kg in the post-intervention group, p &lt; 0.0001). The median and maximum FLACC pain scores along with clinical safety profiles were statistically equivalent between the groups. The intervention was associated with a 2-day reduction in post-operative length of stay (p &lt; 0.0001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The implementation of standing IV acetaminophen alone can successfully reduce post-operative opioid use in infants being treated on the acute care floor while maintaining equivalent FLACC pain scores. Given the negative clinical effects opiate use can have in post-operative infants, similar opiate reduction strategies may be of value in various departments and at other institutions.

NAT is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, however less is known about the financial burden, particularly in comparison to accidental trauma (AT), in the pediatric population. We sought to compare hospital length of stay and charges between pediatric patients presenting with NAT and AT.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Pediatric (&lt;16 years) trauma hospitalizations from 2006-2018 were identified using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS) and Kid&rsquo;s Inpatient Sample (KID) databases. Hospitalizations were identified as NAT or AT based on ICD codes. Discharge weights were used to obtain national estimates and standardize across the different sampling structures. Sampling strata include Census division, location (urban vs. rural), teaching status, hospital control, and bed size. Multivariate logistic and linear regression, adjusting for demographics and hospital characteristics, were used to assess association between NAT and AT admissions and inpatient outcomes (length of stay, total charges and death).

NAT patients were younger at admission, more female, less likely to be categorized as white (47.2% vs. 53.5%; p&lt;0.001), more under public insurance, and more from low-income households (41.5% vs. 31.3%; p&lt;0.001) than AT patients. There was significantly higher mortality, hospital length of stay, and hospital charges among NAT patients compared to those with AT. On multivariate regression analysis, patients with NAT were more than three times as likely to die as those with AT (aOR: 3.4; 95%CI: 3.1-3.9). NAT was associated with significantly longer hospital length of stay (CIE: 2.6; 95%CI: 1.6-3.6) and higher hospital charges (CIE: 11.6 95%CI 7.9-15.3) compared to AT. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Using an administrative, national database, we found that non-accidental trauma in pediatric patients is associated with significantly higher hospital charges, longer hospital length of stay and mortality rate than accidental trauma. This study, one of the largest of its kind, highlights the need for ongoing community injury prevention efforts and parental/caregiver education to decrease the incidence of non-accidental trauma.

However, caregivers often feel that BF are more natural, better tolerated, and more cost-effective. We seek to assess the early use of BF, potential complications, and satisfaction among caregivers.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Following IRB approval, all patients less than 18 years old seen in consultation for G-tube placement from January 2019-January 2021 were identified. All patients received education for use of the G-tube prior to placement; however, choice of tube feeds was at the discretion of caretakers. A survey was administered to caretakers at the 6-8 week visit for the first scheduled G-tube exchange addressing the use of blended feeds, reasons for use or disuse, type, and preparation of commercial or homemade blended feeds, complications, and satisfaction. Demographic data, clinic and ED visit data and operative details were obtained retrospectively via chart review.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 146 patients met inclusion criteria and had complete survey data. 11/146 (7.5%) patients used blended feeds; 3 (2.1%) utilized home blended feeds, 2 (1.4%) commercial blended feeds, 3 (2.1%) combined formula and home blended feeds, 2 (1.4%) combined formula and commercial blended feeds, and 1 (0.7%) patient was fed both home and commercial blended feeds. The most common reasons for using blended feeds were the composition of more natural ingredients (64%) and better tolerance compared to formula feeds (55%). Among those who did not use blended feeds, lack of knowledge about the option and preparation of blended feeds were most commonly cited by 71% and 25% of caretakers, respectively. Two patients on home blended and formula feed mixtures experienced two episodes of obstruction each, which resolved with flushing at home. There were no emergency department or surgery clinic visits required to evaluate or replace a clogged G-tube, and no clog requiring reoperation prior to first scheduled G-tube change. Nine (82%) caretakers described satisfaction with using blended feeds, and ten (91%) stated they were &lsquo;very satisfied&rsquo; with the use of blended feeds for their child.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Use of blended feeds after G-tube placement within our institution is low, commonly due to a lack of education regarding the potential for use, preparation, and safety. There is high satisfaction among caregivers who used blended feeds, with no documented obstructions requiring exchange or reoperation. Further caregiver education is needed to address the option for use, risks, and benefits of blended feeds to inform further study.

Lurie Children's Hospital, Division Of Pediatric Surgery, Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: There is no evidence-based consensus regarding urgency for appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Controversy exists as to how preoperative delays affect patient safety and quality of care, particularly when diagnosis occurs overnight. Over a 3-year period, our institution trialed efforts to expedite appendectomy workflow, as well as focused quality improvement on same-day discharges for uncomplicated disease. Here, we describe the effects of expedited delivery of care as well as standardization on costs and outcomes relative to historic controls. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patient records at a freestanding children&rsquo;s hospital were reviewed from synchronized 6-month periods during 3 consecutive years. During Year 1 (historic), no standardized workflows existed. Year 2 was characterized by initiation of a same-day discharge protocol and an initiative in which appendectomies for acute appendicitis were performed within two hours of disease confirmation (expedited). In Year 3 (QI workflow), timing of operation was relaxed to same calendar day as presentation, while all aspects of perioperative care were fully protocolized. Descriptive statistics between the three years were performed, using rate of perforation as the primary outcome, and including other clinical secondary outcomes. Additionally, operating room costs were compared among the three groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the study period 296 patients underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis. There were no differences in baseline demographics, symptom duration, perforation rates, 30-day readmissions, or reintervention rates between the three groups. The expedited workflow cohort length of stay was 14.8 hours shorter (p = 0.0028) when compared to historic controls alone. Notably, the Year 3 median length of stay was similar to year 2 despite longer preoperative delays. In multivariate regression, perforation was the only variable associated with length of stay. Perforation was predicted most accurately by prehospital duration of symptoms, without significant effect from in-hospital time to operating room. Additionally, during the 6-month time period of the expedited workflow call teams were called in more often resulting in over $110,000 worth of overtime expense and called-in expense as compared to the QI workflow and over $90,000 in the standard workflow.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We found that increasing the urgency to time of appendectomy had no effect on rates of perforation nor other clinical outcomes. Overall hospital length of stay was initially shortened; however, this can be attributed to simultaneous QI initiatives, as the effect was durable even following relaxation of the time-to-OR targets. In fact, expediting appendectomies regardless of time of day led to increased hospital expenses due to call team utilization. We conclude that appendectomy outcomes are best predicted by prehospital factors such as duration of symptoms, rather than in-hospital delays in surgical management.

Following ACS implementation at our institution, we developed a perioperative clinical pathway for acute appendicitis to improve efficiency and standardize postoperative care. The purpose of our study is to assess the impact of our ACS clinical pathway for patients with acute appendicitis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a retrospective cohort study involving patients admitted to our tertiary care facility with acute appendicitis who underwent appendectomy. Demographic data, hospital length of stay (LOS), recovery unit discharge rates and inpatient pharmaceutical data were abstracted from patient medical records. Patients were classified by pre- (January 1, 2016-July 31, 2018) and post-initiation (August 1, 2018-December 31, 2020) of our ACS clinical pathway (figure one). Primary outcome was hospital LOS. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS with a p-value &lt;0.05 determined as significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 492 patients were analyzed with 225 in the pre-clinical pathway and 267 in the post-clinical pathway. LOS was significantly decreased in our post clinical pathway cohort (31.2 hours vs 50.4 hours, p &lt;0.001). We identified a significant decrease in CT to OR time (6.81 vs 11.4 hours, p &lt;0.001) and time from CT to antibiotic administration (2.20 vs 3.37 hours, p &lt;0.001) in our post clinical pathway cohort. Rate of recovery unit discharge (20 vs. 9%, p&lt;0.001) was significantly increased post utilization of our clinical pathway, while inpatient opioid utilization in morphine equivalents (125 ME vs. 172 ME, p&lt;0.001) was significantly decreased. Furthermore, discharge prescription antibiotic rates were decreased following the implementation of our clinical pathway (23.6% vs. 30.7%, p=.077).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our ACS clinical pathway for acute appendicitis resulted in earlier surgical intervention, greater recovery unit discharge and decrease LOS. Furthermore, patients had earlier administration of antibiotics, decreased discharge prescription antibiotic rates and decreased inpatient opioid utilization. Further prospective investigation into the role of an ACS clinical pathway on improving patient outcomes with acute appendicitis is warranted.

Utilizing pre-operative educational strategies as well as multimodal analgesia we sought to reduce the post-operative opioid use in elective general surgery cases to zero.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Between November 2019 and August 2021, we developed an opioid sparing protocol (education on the importance of opioid avoidance in the clinic and a single dose of 75mg of pregabalin, 1000mg of acetaminophen, and 600mg of ibuprofen pre-operatively) for patients undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair (IHR) or cholecystectomy. Patients were split into three cohorts: the first cohort established a control baseline before any change in practice, the second cohort underwent the intervention and was provided an opioid script on discharge for breakthrough pain, the third was provided no opioid prescription upon discharge. Two weeks after discharge patients were interviewed to record opioid consumption, pain scores, and level of satisfaction since discharge.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 129 patients in total were recruited for the study. 88 patients underwent IHR and 41 patients underwent cholecystectomy. No major demographic or clinical differences existed between the three groups. Post-operative morphine equivalents consumed in the baseline group (n=58; 43.3 + 7.6) were significantly when the pre-operative analgesia assisted protocol was enacted (n=42; 11.2 + 5.7) and further reduced to zero for every patient in the no opioid group (n=29) (p&lt;0.0001). There were no differences in patients&rsquo; reported average pain scores after discharge (baseline: 2.9 + 0.2 v analgesia-assisted: 2.2 + 0.2 v no-opioid: 3.9 + 0.3, p=0.18), pain scores at two weeks after surgery (baseline: 1.7 + 0.2 v analgesia-assisted: 1.5 + 0.1 v no-opioid: 1.9 + 0.3, p=0.08), or satisfaction levels with experience (baseline: 9.4 + 0.1 v analgesia-assisted: 9.2 + 0.2 v no-opioid: 9.1 + 0.3, p=0.55) on scales of one to ten.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequently encountered in clinical practice and often requires more complex management strategies. However, its impact on outcomes of patients warranting emergency general surgery (EGS) has not been well characterized. The present study examined the association of CKD stage on in-hospital outcomes, resource use, and readmission following EGS using a nationally representative cohort.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The 2016-2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried to identify all adult hospitalizations for EGS operations including large bowel resection (LBR), small bowel resection (SBR), cholecystectomy, appendectomy, lysis of adhesions, and repair of perforated gastric/duodenal ulcer. Patients undergoing EGS &gt;2 days from admission as well as those with trauma-related hospitalizations were excluded. Patients were stratified by severity of CKD into stages 1-3 (CKD1-3), stages 4-5 (CKD 4-5), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and others (Non-CKD). Logistic models were used to examine factors associated with in-hospital outcomes including mortality and readmissions, while generalized linear models were used to model risk-adjusted inpatient costs. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to study 90-day readmissions by severity of CKD.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of an estimated 982,689 patients undergoing EGS operations, 62,597 (6.4%) had a diagnosis of CKD (CKD 1-3: 65.3%, CKD 4-5: 11.2%, ESRD: 23.4%). Patients with CKD were older (71.4&plusmn;13.2 vs 54.5 &plusmn;18.4, p&lt;0.001) and had more chronic conditions (Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 2.3&plusmn;1.9 vs 5.6&plusmn;2.0, p&lt;0.001). Unadjusted rates of mortality increased with the severity of kidney disease in a stepwise manner (2.1% in Non-CKD to 17.3 in ESRD, p&lt;0.001), as did 90-day readmissions (5.5% to 8.6 respectively, p&lt;0.001). After adjustment for patient and hospital factors, ESRD was independently associated with increased risk-adjusted rates of mortality for patients undergoing SBR, LBR, and lysis of adhesions (Figure). Additionally, ESRD patients had greater odds of 90-day readmission (adjusted odds ratio: 1.7, 95% CI 1.6-1.9, reference Non-CKD) among those undergoing EGS. Relative to Non-CKD, those with ESRD had the greatest incremental cost burden when undergoing repair of duodenal perforation (&beta;: +$83,600, 95% CI 69,400-97,800) and the lowest for lysis of adhesions (&beta;: +$41,000, 95% CI 30,500-50,100).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

CKD severity is associated with a stepwise increase in mortality, hospitalization costs, and 90- day readmissions following EGS. Our findings may better inform shared decision-making and have implications in benchmarking. Further studies for optimal management strategies in this high-risk group are needed.

Bokhari<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>John H Stroger Jr Hospital of Cook County, Trauma And Burns, Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

There is a paucity of literature regarding gender-based differences in outcomes in basic surgical procedures, including appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Laparoscopic appendectomy is one of the most commonly performed procedures in general surgery. While considered to be a routine procedure, it is rarely associated with adverse outcomes. The purpose of this study is to identify gender specific risk factors among patients in order to guide the management of acute appendicitis to prevent these adverse outcomes. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

For this study, we abstracted data from the ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database from the years 2016-2018 using the CPT codes for laparoscopic and open appendectomy. We excluded patients who underwent an appendectomy for reasons other than acute appendicitis, including neoplasms. Statistical analysis was performed to assess gender differences with regards to patient outcomes including complications, LOS, discharge disposition, and mortality. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

Overall, 125,328 patients were included. Among all appendectomies, 8.6% were elective, and 61.2% were emergent. The mean age was 40 (16), and the majority of the patients were white (66.9%). The most common comorbidities were active smoking status (16.8%), hypertension (16.3%), and diabetes (5.3%). Overall, 32.2% presented with sepsis/SIRS. 6.3 had at least one complication, the most common being organ space infection (2.6%), and unplanned return to OR (1.0%). The median length of stay (LOS) was 1 day (IQR 1, 2). Most of the patients (98.7%) were discharged to home, with only 54 (&lt;0.1%) patients experiencing mortality. 

Bivariate analysis revealed that females were more likely to have elective surgery (9.1% vs 8.1%). They were also less likely to develop an organ space infection (2.2% vs 2.9%), or postoperative sepsis (3.4% vs 4.8%). 

Binomial regression revealed that compared with males, females were less likely to require an emergent surgery (OR: 0.97, CI: 0.94-0.99, p=0.008), and were less likely to experience organ space SSI (OR: 0.88, CI: 0.82-0.95, p=0.001), dehiscence (OR: 0.53, CI: 0.31-0.94, p=0.029), or postoperative sepsis (OR: 0.80, CI: 0.75-85OR: 1.246, p&lt;0.0001). They were more likely to experience cardiac arrest (OR: 2.58, 1.24-5.41, p=0.012), UTI (OR: 3.82, CI: 3.07-4.74 p&lt;0.0001), CVA (OR: 2.39, CI: 1.12-5.08 p=0.024),and postoperative bleeding (OR: 1.59, CI: 1.27-1.99 p&lt;0.001). There was no significant difference in LOS, discharge disposition, or mortality. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 

In conclusion, males and females are at risk for different complications following appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Specifically, males were more likely to experience organ space infection, wound dehiscence, and sepsis, while females were more at risk for cardiac arrest, UTI, CVA, and postoperative bleeding. Surgeons should consider these findings in the perioperative period prevent complications, diagnose them early, and manage them appropriately.

Malignancies associated with MD are rare and poorly studied outside of single institution case reports. We sought to characterize MD malignancies via associated demographic, clinical, and long-term outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to abstract patients with a diagnosis of primary malignancy of MD between 2000-2018. Demographic and clinical differences were compared with continuous variables analyzed using ANOVA, and categorical variables with Chi-squared tests. Cumulative life table analysis was used to compare long-term survival.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 224 patients were identified. The mean age at presentation was 61.7 &plusmn; 15.3 years. Adenocarcinoma typically presented at younger ages, however there was no statistically significant age difference among MD-related malignancy subtypes. Carcinoid was the most common MD-associated malignancy (77.2%). Males accounted for more carcinoid and neuroendocrine malignancy diagnoses (69.4%, 71.4%), however adenocarcinomas and GISTs had equal gender distribution. Caucasians accounted for &gt;90% of all malignancy subtypes. 50% of patients with MD-associated adenocarcinoma suffered regional or distant spread, compared to other types of malignancy subtypes, p=.002. 97.3% of patients received cancer-directed surgery. Cancer specific mortality rates were highest in adenocarcinoma (50%), followed by GIST (27.8%), carcinoid (14.5%) and neuroendocrine (9.5%), p=.006. Adenocarcinoma portended the worst overall 5-year cancer-specific survival (27%) compared to neuroendocrine (89%), carcinoid (87%) and GIST (72%), p=.004.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Carcinoid tumors are the most common malignancies associated with MD. Surgical excision is pursued in nearly all cases with carcinoid, neuroendocrine carcinoma and GISTs tumors having favorable long-term survival outcomes. Adenocarcinomas of Meckel&rsquo;s diverticulum are the most rare, yet most clinically significant subtype with the youngest average age at diagnosis and significant 5-year mortality.

Roadster 1&amp;2 clinical trials concluded excellent early outcomes for patients undergoing carotid revascularization using TCAR. It is not clear if procedure outcomes vary depending on the type of anesthesia utilized for TCAR. Using the combined trial cohorts, we compare and report the peri-operative 30-day outcome differences in patients undergoing TCAR with either GA or LA.

 

METHODS :The ROADSTER 1&amp; 2 trial is a prospective, open label, single arm, multicenter pre &amp; post-approval registries respectively for evaluating safety and efficacy of ENROUTE&trade; Neuroprotection system in patients undergoing TCAR. Patients considered at high risk for complications from carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with symptomatic stenosis &ge;50% or asymptomatic stenosis &ge;80% with intention to treat were included. Demographic data and hierarchical analyses for any Major adverse events (MAE), death, stroke and MI for the pooled data (ROADSTER 1 &amp; 2, combined), along with the intra-study results by general anesthesia vs. Local /Regional anesthesia was compared. Probability values were calculated using two-tailed Fisher&rsquo;s exact test and 1-factor analysis of variance model.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: This study enrolled 833 patients who underwent TCAR, with 565 procedures (67%) completed using GA. There was no differences in the age range (p=0.1520), Gender (66.4 %v/s 69.4% Male p=0.429), asymptomatic status (72.9% v/s 76.5% p=0.309) between GA and LA patients respectively. There was no differences in the 30 day MAE (3.4% v/s 3.0%), Death (0.7% v/s 0.4%), Stroke (1.6% v/s2.2 %), MI (1.1% v/s 0.4%) between GA and LA groups. Summary of statistical analyses based on hierarchical presentation is presented in table. There was no differences in the length of stay (p=0.2532), Cranial nerve injury (1.4% v/s 1.1% p=1.000) between two groups. Total procedure time (73.51 +/- 29.385 min [mean +/- SD] v/s 84.05 +/- 34.021 min), total flow reversal time (10.74 +/- 6.601 min v/s 12.43 +/- 9.123 min) favored GA

 

CONCLUSIONS :Pooled analysis of patients from ROADSTER trials suggests no differences in the MAE, Death, Stroke, and MI irrespective of the type of anesthesia used for Transcarotid revascularization. This study adds to our ongoing understanding of procedure time and flow reversal time as it favors use of GA for TCAR. As Experience continues to increase with TCAR, choice of anesthetic technique should be dependent on the patient &amp; physician preferences

The novel coronavirus has forced health systems around the world to adopt telemedicine practices, which included patients undergoing major surgery. However, it is unclear whether use of telemedicine before or after surgery had an adverse effect on surgical outcomes, resource utilization, or patient satisfaction. We designed this study to evaluate whether surgical care quality and outcomes following cardiothoracic (CT) and vascular surgery procedures were affected by the use of telemedicine for pre-operative and post-operative evaluation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We identified all patients who underwent CT or vascular procedures at a single academic institution between October 2018 and March 2021 and determined whether outpatient clinic visits had been conducted entirely in-person, via telemedicine, or a mixture of both. After stratifying patients by how their pre- and post-operative evaluation was conducted, we evaluated the incidence of hospital readmissions or emergency department (ED) visits up to three months after their procedure. Patient satisfaction data was obtained from Press Ganey surveys (scored 0-5) the patients completed for either in-person or telemedicine visits. The association between telemedicine utilization with patient experience and clinical outcomes was evaluated using a logistic regression model, which adjusted for rural status and type of surgery.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 109 patients were identified who underwent CT (65%) or vascular surgery (35%) procedures during the time period, of which 48% were evaluated entirely via in-person visits, 23% entirely via telemedicine, and 29% with a mixture of both. There was no significant difference in the demographics or comorbidities of patients between these groups. Patients who solely used telemedicine were equally likely to need an ED visit within 3-months after surgery as patients who were seen in-person or with both types of encounters (20% telemedicine, 21% in-person, and 22% mixed; P=0.99). However, patients using telemedicine were significantly less likely to require readmission within 90 days (8% telemedicine, 35% in-person, and 31% mixed; P=0.043). These findings were confirmed in risk-adjusted regression models where telemedicine was associated with lower odds ratio for readmission (OR: 0.47; P=0.019). Finally, there was no significant difference in patient satisfaction with telemedicine versus in-person clinic visits (4.79 for telemedicine vs. 4.91 for in-person; P=0.086).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Telemedicine utilization in this study among cardiovascular patients was not associated with worse outcomes, patient experience, or resource utilization after surgery. These results suggest that telemedicine may be an alternative modality for pre- and post-operative evaluation that will increase convenience of care without sacrificing quality of care. Future work is needed to help assess the impact of telemedicine utilization for all types of surgical patients.

The distribution of timing in mortality has not been previously characterized for RAAA. Similar to what is seen following traumatic injury, we hypothesize that time to RAAA mortality will be bimodal with early deaths attributable to hemorrhagic shock and late deaths due to multiple organ failure and inability to recover from the initial insult. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified all RAAA repairs in the Vascular Quality Initiative dataset (2010-2020). Days to death were calculated in those who died in the postoperative period (within 30 days). The median time to death was used to separate early and late deaths. We described characteristics associated with mortality in the early and late periods using multi-variable logistic regression clustered by hospital.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 5,157 RAAA repairs (age 7210 years; 77% male; 88% white; endovascular repair 61%), 1,446 (28%) died within 30 days. Median time to death was 1d (IQR 1-7), defining the early (&le; 1d) and late (2-30d) mortality periods. The proportion of early (&le; 1d) to total postoperative mortality was 36.5% (N=528). Compared to those who survived, both early and late mortality were associated with older age and female sex (Table). Early mortality was associated with open repair and signs of hemorrhagic shock (hemoglobin&lt;7g/dL, hypotension, and greater blood loss). Late mortality however was not associated with signs of hemorrhagic shock or repair type but was significantly associated with baseline heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and elevated creatinine. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Late mortality is strongly associated with baseline comorbidities and inability to recover from the physiologic stress of RAAA and operative insults. Future studies of RAAA mortality and targeted interventions should investigate and account for these temporal differences in mortality.

Fenestrated and branched aortic stent grafts have increased the endovascular solutions for complex aortic aneurysms. However, these specialized grafts may be anatomically incompatible or unavailable on an urgent/emergent basis. We present our early experience with in-situ laser fenestration (ISLF) of visceral vessels in various types of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All patients who underwent endovascular repair of an aortic aneurysm with additional laser fenestration of at least one visceral branch were retrospectively reviewed. Technical success was defined as successful aortic aneurysm repair with a patent laser fenestrated visceral branch. Postoperative morbidity and mortality, fluoroscopic time, radiocontrast volume and endoleak rate were reviewed. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Seven patients underwent ISLF of visceral aortic branches between March 2019 and July 2021. Mean age was 73.3 &plusmn; 4.2 years. Six out of seven patients (85%) were male. The ISLFs were as follows: 2 celiac arteries with thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (TEVAR); 1 superior mesenteric artery during suprarenal repair; 1 right renal artery during fenestrated EVAR; 1 right renal during EVAR, 1 left renal artery during EVAR, and 1 combined right and left renal artery during EVAR. All patients had sheath access of the targeted visceral vessel through an alternative access sites in preparation to perform a snorkel procedure, in case the laser fenestration failed (Figure 1). A stent was placed in the targeted vessel to fluoroscopically mark the origin of the vessel. After laser fenestration, serial dilation was preformed, and a covered stent graft (Icast, Atrium Medical Corporation) was deployed into the vessel, then flared. All procedures were technically successful with no arterial perforations and no evidence of type III endoleaks. Mean Fluoroscopy time was 81.8&plusmn;28.3 minutes, and average contrast load was 186&plusmn;43 cc. Postoperatively, there were no instances of renal insufficiency and no mortalities. Four patients had post-ISLF follow-up with Computed Tomography (CT) imaging (mean 17&plusmn;9 weeks) demonstrating ISLF patency in all cases with no type III endoleaks.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In our experience, ISLF of visceral aortic branches is a useful adjunct to the existing stent technologies. By allowing for extension of seal zones while maintaining anatomically aligned visceral vessel flow, ISLF increases our endovascular solutions for treating complex aortic aneurysms.

In particular, those with unpredictable, high acuity conditions are vulnerable to unexpected price differences, as they are unable to &lsquo;shop around&rsquo;. While variability has been demonstrated in overall episode charges, little is known about the facility-level variability of out-of-pocket (OOP) costs. In this study, we evaluate facility-level variability in OOP costs among patients with acute appendicitis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We used data from a large, US commercial insurer to identify non-elderly adult patients (18-64yo) presenting with acute appendicitis from October 2015-December 2019. Our cohort consisted of facilities with &ge; 20 admissions for appendicitis. We calculated average OOP costs and average total reimbursement for each facility, including spending for index admission and 30d post-discharge (inpatient, outpatient, provider, facility, and medications). We also stratified by high-deductible health plan (HDHP) status. Facilities were clustered into deciles; t-test or ANOVA were used as indicated.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 3,778 patients admitted for acute appendicitis identified across 244 hospitals. Mean total reimbursement for the top decile of facilities was $42,686 (95%CI: 38,326-47,047) compared to $21,050 (95%CI: 20,670-21,430) for facilities in the bottom decile (p&lt;0.01). Mean OOP costs for the top decile of facilities was $4,377 (95%CI: 4,194-4,560) vs. $1,503 in the bottom decile (95%CI: 1,353-$1,652) (p&lt;0.01) (Figure). Deductible spending accounted for 38% of OOP spending among bottom decile facilities and 45% of OOP spending at top decile facilities (p&lt;0.01). Conversely, coinsurance accounted for 59% versus 48% of OOP spending among bottom versus top decile facilities (p&lt;0.01). However, stratified analyses of only patients with HDHPs revealed a mean OOP spending of $2,551 (95%CI: $1,959-$3,143) versus $4,663 (95%CI: $4,009-$5,226) at bottom versus top decile hospitals (p&lt;0.01). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Among patients presenting with acute appendicitis, the costs of care are highly variable across facilities, with OOP costs nearly 3x greater and total spending over 2x greater at top versus bottom decile facilities. These findings have important implications for patients, as there is little ability or time for price comparison prior to appendicitis or other unpredictable emergency conditions. Continued policy efforts are required to decrease variability across facilities for high cost, high acuity conditions and thereby mitigate excess financial burden to patients and the health system.

Mao<sup>1</sup>, R. Lu<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch, Surgery, Galveston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy (RALP) is a standard procedure performed worldwide, and inguinal hernias can be present in up to 33% of patients. Many surgeons have avoided concomitant hernia repair in this setting due to the potential risk of mesh-related complications given the presence of a fresh vesicourethral anastomosis. We aim to describe the patient demographics, operative details, and 30 &ndash; day outcomes of concomitant RALP and Robotic Inguinal Hernia Repair (RIHR) and compare it to patients undergoing RIHR alone when performed by surgeons participating in the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative (ACHQC).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients who have undergone concomitant RALP and RIHR with 30-day follow-up available were identified within the ACHQC database. Using propensity score algorithm, those were matched with a cohort of patients undergoing RIHR alone based on confounders such as body mass index, age, ASA class, smoking, hernia size, recurrent status and prior pelvic operation. The groups were compared for 30-day rates of surgical site infection (SSI), surgical site occurrences (SSO), overall complications and hernia recurrence.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

4323 males who underwent RIHR were identified in the ACHQC database, 24 patients underwent concomitant RALP. After the propensity score matching, 72 matched patients underwent RIHR alone (3:1). The median age was 64 years, 33% were obese and 17% were smokers. Most patients underwent bilateral inguinal hernia repair in both groups and most hernias were between 1.5-3cm. All patients were repaired with permanent synthetic mesh and suturing was the most common type of mesh fixation in both groups. The use of self-fixating mesh was more common in the RIHR alone group (49% vs. 12% p=0.002) and the use of tack was more common in the RALP + RIHR group (21% vs. 0% p&lt;0.001).

There were no SSI and no intraoperative complications in both groups. The rate of any postoperative complication was 21% in the RALP + RIHR group and 15% in the RIHR (p=0.53). The SSO rate was 12% in the study group (all seromas) and 11% in the control group (p=0.85). No patients in the study group required any procedural intervention or developed a recurrence. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
RALP+RIHR appears not to result in increased rates of wound complications, overall complications or early recurrence when compared to patients undergoing RIHR alone. Prospective, controlled studies with larger number of patients are needed to confirm our findings.

Chamberlain<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>HCA/USF Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point, General Surgery, Hudson, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is a modification of the 0.25% bupivacaine routine formulation (RB), and has delayed-release capabilities as a local anesthetic. LB has the potential to provide sustained pain control and decrease the need for postoperative opioid use. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) patients may experience considerable postsurgical pain, and intraoperative transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks have emerged as a standard of care for pain management. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A comprehensive review of PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials for all published randomized control trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and meta-analyses assessing the difference in opioid consumption between LB and RB when used in a TAP block for laparoscopic or robotic MIS. Primary outcomes analyzed were total opioid consumption in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) in 48 hours, and pain and nausea rates in the first 24 hours postoperatively. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 10 articles and 982 patients were evaluated to determine differences in postoperative outcomes when comparing LB to RB. Four studies recording total opioid consumption in 48 hours reported no significant difference in the mean opioid consumption (p &lt; 0.661). Five studies recording 24-hour postoperative pain scores reported no significant difference in the mean pain score (p &lt; 0.091). Three studies reporting 24-hour postoperative nausea did not significantly lower the incidence of nausea in the LB TAP block group (RR =0.560, p &lt; 0.001). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite the advantages of MIS, postoperative pain can be significant and often requires oral opioids. While TAP block has been shown to be a highly effective means to reduce post-op pain and opioid use, the use of LP for TAP block is not associated with decreased opioid consumption or a decrease in pain scores. LB TAP block is effective in reducing the incidence of nausea in postoperative patients based upon limited data. LB TAP block is not superior to RB TAP block for most MIS surgery patients.

The need to train surgical residents to operate independently must be balanced against the failure of the US healthcare system to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in surgical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether having a chief resident perform a general surgery operation, as opposed to an attending physician, contributed to racial/ethnic disparities in perioperative outcomes. We hypothesized that having operations performed by chief residents rather than attending physicians would be associated with longer operative times and more complications, but that resident involvement wouldn&rsquo;t exacerbate racial disparities.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We utilized the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 1998-2019 to identify Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic patients having common general surgery operations as categorized by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) including basic and complex laparoscopic cases, alimentary tract, abdominal, breast, endocrine, and vascular operations. We used inverse probability weighting of the propensity score to measure the association between surgeon of record (attending vs chief resident) and differences in operative time and postoperative complications across racial/ethnic groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

We evaluated 156,195 (55.5%) cases performed by attendings alone and 125,383 (44.5%) by chief residents. In our cohort 184,255 patients were Caucasian, 39,731 African American, and 14,521 Hispanic. After risk adjustment, African American patients were 31.5% more likely to have their surgery performed by a chief resident (95% CI 13.3%-49.6%, p=0.001) compared to Caucasian patients while Hispanic patients were as likely as Caucasians to have operations performed by attendings (p=0.6). Cases performed by chief residents were associated with a 2.0% (95% CI 1.3%-2.7%, p&lt;0.001) increase in complications for Caucasian patients and a 1.5% increase (CI 0.5%-2.4%, p=0.003) for African American patients, but there were no significant differences for Hispanic patients. Chief resident cases had longer operative times for Caucasian (+15.2 minutes, 95% CI 8.5-21.8, p&lt;0.001) and African American patients (7.1 minutes ,95% CI 0.6-13.5, p=0.03), but there were no significant differences for Hispanic patients. These findings were preserved for each ACGME case category.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Overall, having chief residents perform general surgery procedures rather than attending physicians is associated with longer operative times and a small increase in postoperative complications overall. Although African American patients were significantly more likely to have their operation performed by a chief resident than an attending surgeon, we did not find evidence that chief resident participation in general surgery cases significantly exacerbates health disparities between Caucasian and African American or Hispanic patients.

Although bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for obesity, it is also associated with an increase in new persistent opioid use. To date, it is unclear how bariatric surgery affects patients who use opioids prior to surgery.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using a statewide bariatric-specific data registry, we analyzed all patients who self-reported opioid use prior to undergoing bariatric surgery between 2006 and 2020 (n=8,506). We compared patient characteristics, risk-adjusted 30-day postoperative outcomes and weight loss at 1 year between patients who self-reported discontinuing opioid use 1 year after surgery and those who did not. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was used to identify patient factors that were predictors of persistent opioid use.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among all patients who self-reported using opioids prior to bariatric surgery, 3,864 (45.4%) reported that they discontinued use at 1 year after bariatric surgery. Clinically significant independent predictors of persistent use of opioids after surgery (n=4,642, 54.6%) included annual income of &lt;$10,000 (OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.06-1.44, p=0.006), Medicare insurance (OR=1.48, 95% CI=1.32-1.66, p&lt;0.0001), history of a psychological disorder (OR=1.21, CI 1.09-1.33, p=0.0002) and preoperative tobacco use (OR=1.36, CI=1.16-1.59, p=0.0001). Persistent users were more likely to have surgical complications (9.6% vs 7.5%, p=0.0328) and an extended hospital length of stay (9.7% vs. 5.9%, p=0.0003). There were no differences in the morphine milligram equivalents (MME) prescribed within the first 30 days following surgery between groups (122.3 vs 126.5, p=0.3813). At 1 year, persistent users were also found to have less total body weight loss (28.0% vs 29.3%, p&lt;0.0001) when compared to patients who discontinued opioids after surgery.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Nearly half of the patients who reported taking opioids prior to bariatric surgery discontinued them at 1 year after surgery. Persistent users of opioids, who were more likely to be from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, experienced higher rates of complications and less weight loss. Targeted interventions aimed at high-risk patients may help increase the number of patients who discontinue chronic opioid use after bariatric surgery.

It is unclear whether gender homophily exists among providers as well. The goal of this study is to analyze referral data to identify factors that may influence patient referrals to female versus male proceduralists. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An observational study of the EPIC-captured referral data at a large academic center was performed. EPIC was started in 2016 at this institution, and there remain two different referral systems, one through EPIC and another through direct provider contacts. Patients referred through EPIC to general surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, interventional cardiology, and gastroenterology in 2016-2021 were included. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, with the dependent variable of female gender for the receiving proceduralist, and independent variables including the age and gender of the referring provider, and age, race, gender, and insurance status of the patient.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 4586 patient records from 535 referring providers were analyzed, with 2216 (48.3%) referred to female proceduralists. In this study, patients referred to female proceduralists were less likely to be older (age&ge; 50: 25.8% vs 28.6%, p&lt;0.001), be white (82.9% vs 87.4%, p&lt;0.001), have private insurance (77.9% vs 82.5%, p&lt;0.001), be men (29.2% vs 46.0%, p&lt;0.001), or be referred from male providers (31.0% vs 38.8%, p&lt;0.001). On adjusted analysis, male patients, older patients, patients who were referred from male providers remained significantly less likely to be referred to female proceduralists.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We found a difference in referral patterns between male and female providers. Male referring providers are less likely to refer patients to female proceduralists when compared to female referring providers. Older and male patients are less likely to be referred to female proceduralists when compared to younger and female patients. Since there are more male physicians in the workforce, and since male physicians are more likely to refer to male physicians, the gender homophily in provider referral may contribute to fewer referrals for female proceduralists.

Morbidity and mortality are severe in ventilated patients. PPE and staff are limited and the demand for resources such as ventilators, sedation agents and respiratory therapists are increasing. Tracheostomy is challenging due to significant exposure risk to staff from aerosolization, however it may help circumvent resource scarcity and aid in ventilator weaning. We describe the process of performing a tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients to facilitate ventilator liberation, minimize exposure, and optimize transport of high-risk patients. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Preliminary data was reviewed in this single institution, retrospective review of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ICU who underwent tracheostomy. Modifications to the tracheostomy procedure in the setting of a COVID-19 positive patient include: the use of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) for all staff in the operating room, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) viral filters on ventilator and suction tubing, the use of intravenous (IV) sedation only, having the endotracheal tube advanced toward the carina in order to remove the operative tracheotomy site from the closed ventilatory circuit during tracheotomy, and pausing the ventilatory circuit during the process of removing the endotracheal tube and inserting the tracheostomy in order to reduce exposure of aerosolized viral particles to the team. ?All patients underwent open tracheostomy in the same fashion. The data was analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics. Our primary aims were to describe the procedure and the outcome characteristics to determine the safety of performing open tracheostomy on COVID-19 positive patients. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The newly developed modification to the tracheostomy procedure was described in detail ensuring safety for the operative staff. Fourteen patients with COVID-19 underwent tracheostomy split between 10 males and 4 females. The average age of the patient population was 65.14 years (44 to 81 years). Only 35.7% of patients required sedation after tracheostomy, while only 14.2% of patients went without pre-operative sedation. In total, the average time of sedation needed after tracheostomy was 1.92 days, with the longest time on sedation being 13 days. Patients were taken off the ventilator in an average of 5.7 days with 71.4% of patients being extubated in 5 or less days. 92.8% of patients were discharged in 29.8 days with an average total hospital stay of 35.2 days. Of these patients, it took an average of 9.6 days from tracheostomy to be discharged out of the ICU. There were no reported cases of COVID-19 infection among healthcare personnel involved with tracheostomies.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Preliminary data supports the safety and efficacy of performing tracheostomy in a controlled, protocol driven setting, in COVID-19 positive patients.

Chamberlain<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>HCA/USF Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point, General Surgery, Hudson, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is normally a terminal disease, however surgical resection offers a potential cure. GBC is the 5<sup>th</sup> most common GI neoplasm and the most common biliary tract cancer. GBC is often misdiagnosed as biliary colic leading to over half of all new GBC to be diagnosed after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for presumed benign disease. This paper sought to analyze whether intraoperative bile spillage (IBS) during LC for incidental GBC impacted overall and other clinical outcomes. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A comprehensive search of PUBMED, and Google Scholar, was conducted to identify all publications on the incidence of gallbladder cancer during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Key words analyzed included LC, GBC, and bile spillage. Outcomes analyzed were progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), progression free survival at 24 months (PFS24), as well as peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), local and regional recurrence (LRR), distant recurrence (DR), and port site recurrence (PSR)rates. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 8 articles (117 patients) reported on the impact of bile spillage on the outcomes of incidental GBC diagnosis following LC. Three studies reported on PFS, and bile spillage was associated with a significant reduction in PFS (-17.64 months; 95% CI [-27.24 to -8.04]; p&lt;0.001). Bile spillage was also associated with a significant reduction in OS (-21.21 months; 95% CI [-33.26 to -9.15],p=0.001). Bile spillage was also associated with significantly lower odds of PFS24 (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.17-0.96; p=0.039), and significantly higher odds of peritoneal carcinomatosis (OR 3.52; 95% CI 1.27 &ndash; 0.90; p=0.016) and distant recurrence (OR 2.84; 95% CI 1.18-6.81; p=0.020). There was no significant difference in the odds of LRR (OR 2.46; 95% CI 0.902-6.68; p=0.079), liver recurrence (0.95; 95% CI 0.41-2.20; p=0.898), or port site recurrence (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.01-69.05; p=0.928). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most common surgery performed in North America with the incidence of incidental gallbladder cancer reported to be 0.19- 2.8%. Bile spillage is associated with a significant decrease in overall survival, progression-free survival, and progression-free survival within 24 months. Bile spillage is also associated with significantly increased rates of peritoneal carcinomatosis and distant recurrence but does not appear to be associated with liver recurrence or port site recurrence. Surgeons should independently review GB radiologic studies prior to all surgical procedures. If there are any concerning features such as thick GB wall, polyp, etc., special care should be taken to avoid bile spillage, and an open surgical approach should be considered.

Hines VA Hospital, Hines, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Prior studies of adjuvant radiation in patients with intrahepatic and hilar cholangiocarcinoma have primarily been single institutional series including small numbers of patients resected to histologically positive margins. The value of adjuvant radiation in these patients remains unclear.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We queried the National Cancer Database to identify patients undergoing treatment with resection to either histologically free (R0) or histologically positive (R1) surgical margins followed by adjuvant therapy for clinical stage I to III cholangiocarcinoma between 2004 and 2015. Patients with periampullary tumors, those receiving neoadjuvant therapy, undergoing resection to grossly positive (R2) margins, and having fewer than 2 lymph nodes assessed were excluded. Patients were stratified by resection margin. Multivariable logistic regression (MVR) was used to identify factors associated with receipt of adjuvant radiation. Patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy alone were then 1:1 propensity matched for age, demographics, comorbid disease, extent of resection, tumor size, grade, analytic stage, and tumor location to those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Kaplan Meier (KM) method was used to compare overall survival (OS) profiles for the matched cohorts.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 2,031 patients met inclusion criteria. 1,597 (79%) underwent an R0 resection; 434 (21%) an R1 resection. On univariate comparison, use of radiation was higher among patients undergoing R1 resection than among those undergoing R0 resection (71.0% vs 48.3%, p &lt; 0.001). On adjusted analysis, factors associated with use of radiation following R0 resection included (all p &lt; 0.05): comorbidity score of 2 (OR 0.56, CI [0.31, 0.97]), treatment at an academic center (OR 0.50, CI [0.28, 0.87]), tumor size &gt; 6cm (OR 0.35, CI [0.21, 0.58]), and hilar location (OR 2.54, CI [1.80, 3.59]), while those associated with use of radiation following R1 resection included (all p &lt; 0.05): comorbidity score of 2 (OR 0.32, CI [[0.12, 0.83]), tumor size &gt; 6cm (OR 0.42, CI [0.18, 0.97]), and radical resection (OR 1.66, CI [1.01, 2.76]). On KM analysis of matched cohorts, use of radiation was associated with a significant improvement in OS for patients undergoing R1 resection (5-year OS 23.0% vs 8.6%, p = 0.04; Fig 1A) but was not associated with survival in those undergoing R0 resection (5-year OS 29.5% vs 25.0%, p = 0.84; Fig 1B).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In patients undergoing R1 resection for intrahepatic and hilar cholangiocarcinoma, use of adjuvant radiation is associated with a statistically significant improvement in OS. In patients undergoing R0 resection, there is no survival benefit to adjuvant radiation.

However, the timing of PC consultation for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer is often dictated by their surgeon. We hypothesized that pancreatic surgeons may want early PC for themselves, if they had a potentially resectable pancreatic cancer, but would not recommend early PC referral to their patients. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An anonymous international web-based survey was conducted in 2021. Chi-square test or Fisher&rsquo;s exact test were used for analyzing categorical variables and the Wilcox test was utilized for analyzing Likert scaled questions. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 138 surveys were completed. 83% of surgeons were male, 85% completed a fellowship, 80% practiced in academia, 46% performed &gt;30 annual curative-intent operations for PDAC and 90% have been in practice &le;30 years. 88% of surgeons were from the US. 94% of surgeons reported that they would pursue standard of care treatment if they had a potentially curative pancreatic cancer. However, female surgeons (75%) were less likely to report that they would pursue standard of care treatment if they had a potentially curative pancreatic cancer compared to male surgeons (98%) (p&lt;0.0001; OR 0.05; 95% CI (0.01-0.28)). 68% of surgeons would be interested in palliative care referral prior to resection if diagnosed with a resectable pancreatic cancer; however, only 37% of surgeons strongly supported introducing palliative care pre-operatively in the surgeon-patient relationship. Fellowship-trained surgeons were more likely to report that they would want PC referral for themselves prior to resection for pancreatic cancer (72%) compared to surgeons without a fellowship training (43%) (p=0.037; OR 3.35; 95% CI(1.08-10.4)). Surgeons in practice &gt; 30 years were more likely to report that they would not want PC referral prior to resection if diagnosed with resectable pancreatic cancer (p=0.043). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The overweighing majority of surgeons report that they would pursue standard of care for resectable pancreatic cancer with the treatment in line that they recommend to their patients. However, surgeons are more inclined to pursue early palliative care for themselves during disease modifying treatment compared to their patients. Gender, fellowship training, and years in practice influence surgeons&rsquo; personal preference and their recommendations for their patients regarding PC referral. Further studies are needed to elucidate factors that influence physicians&rsquo; recommendations for their patients and the impact of their own personal biases and preferences on their practice.

Aziz<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>USC- Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

NCCN guidelines dictate the sampling of at least 6 lymph nodes for Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), although prior studies have shown low compliance with this recommendation. This study was performed to compare the extent of lymph node harvest (LNH), use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and survival outcomes of patients undergoing surgical resection of ICC in academic and non-academic institutions.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients who were diagnosed with ICC between 2010 and 2017 and underwent surgical resection were identified through the NCDB. Hospital types were classified as academic or non-academic institutions. Primary outcome measure was to assess difference among academic and nonacademic hospitals in obtaining at least 6 lymph nodes. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Overall, 1843 patients were included in the analyses and 20.46% of patients had &gt;= 6 lymph nodes evaluated. There was no significant difference in extent of LNH or use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy between institution types. Kaplan&ndash;Meier did not demonstrate improved survival with the harvest of &gt;= 6 nodes. Cox regression analysis did not identify institution type, extent of LNH, or use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as independent predictors of survival.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our study suggests that compliance with NCCN guidelines on LNH in ICC is low, however extent of LNH, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and oncologic outcomes were equal in academic and non-academic centers.

Sutherland<sup>1</sup>, H. Horng<sup>1</sup>, Z. Tafesh<sup>1</sup>, N. Glass<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Rutgers New Jersey Medical School/ University Hospital, Newark, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Thromboelastography (TEG) is a functional test of coagulation that has been used in trauma, transplant, cardiac surgery, etc. to guide transfusion leading to improved overall outcomes. Despite literature supporting its benefits of improved outcomes, decreased complications and decreased blood product usage, its use is not widespread. With regards to cirrhotic patients, conventional coagulation tests are notoriously inaccurate, and TEG may be a more accurate measure of coagulation. We aimed to assesses the utilization of TEG in cirrhotic patients and assess stewardship of blood transfusions in this high-risk group. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with a previous diagnosis of liver cirrhosis who underwent TEG during May 2021 at a single institution. This institution is located in a large urban area with a variety of patient populations. From a monthly order set list, provided by the institution&rsquo;s lab in charge of these tests, we obtained all the patients who had a TEG done. Following this, we performed a chart review to assess patient demographics, indications for TEG, conventional coagulation profiles, transfusion practices around the time of the assessment, bleeding status, and procedures near the time of the test. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 44 uses of thromboelastography at the institution assessed in May 2021. Of the 19 cirrhotic patients the test was run on, the results were as follows. With respect to R time, 0% of patients who had a high R time (&gt;10 minutes) received FFP, and 43% of patients who did not have a high R time (5-10 minutes) still received FFP. 41% of patients with a low maximum amplitude received platelets whereas 19% of patients with a normal MA (50-70) also received platelets. Finally, 36% of patients with a low alpha angle received cryoprecipitate, and 27% of patients with a normal value (53-72) also received it. 45% of transfused cirrhotic patients were bleeding during or prior to transfusion and TEG, and the remainder of transfused patients were given blood pre-procedural or due to irregular conventional coagulation tests including INR and hemoglobin. The most common procedure being done on cirrhotic patients who had TEGs studied is paracentesis (32%), for which guidelines do not indicate the need for pre-procedural transfusion, liver transplant (20%), and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (16%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite TEG suggesting that transfusions could be safely avoided in many cirrhotic patients, patients are still being transfused platelets, cryoprecipitate, and FFP in the absence of bleeding or other significant risk factors. In addition, in some cases of TEG being run, the results are not being used to guide necessary transfusion. This indicates the need for education about appropriate use of TEG, and signifies the need for more research needs to be done in this patient population to understand the utility of these tests to guide transfusion practices.

We sought to identify the risk factors for increased care at discharge and develop a risk tool to predict postoperative increase in dependence.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database was utilized to identify patients who were &ge; 65 years of age and had a primary hepatic or pancreatic resection from 2015-2019. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of increased dependence during discharge. The accuracy of models were internally validated and a simplified tool to calculate the risk score, risk group, and estimated risk of increased care level was developed (available at https://ktsahara.shinyapps.io/care_discharge/).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 31,338 patients who underwent primary hepatopancreatic surgery, 4,259 (13.6%) had increased level of care at discharge compared to their pre-admission care. The proportion of patients who were least frail (modified Frailty Index (mFI)=1) were similar in the group with escalated discharge care (n=1,880; 44.1%) and unchanged discharge care (n=12,202; 45.1%). However, more patients had escalated discharge care when mFI increased. Similarly, more patients with escalated discharge care had a major procedure (n=2,938; 69%), in-hospital complications (n=1,565; 36.7%) and longer median length of stay (11 days; IQR=8-19). Irrespective of the pre-admission origin status, majority of the patients were discharged to home (n=27,271; 85.9%) while 12.3% (n=3,858) were discharged to a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility. Of note, the odds of increased care at discharge was increased by 1.41 (95%CIs: 1.32-1.50), 1.11 (95%CIs:1.11-1.12), and 1.95 (95%CIs:1.86-2.04), times with every unit increase in mFI, age beyond 65 years, and the number of in-hospital complications, respectively. While the odds of increased care was 1.84 (95%CIs:1.62-2.10) times higher when pre-admission origin status was non-home compared to patients directly admitted from home. As such, the area under receiver operative curve (AUC) for the parsimonious model used to develop risk calculator was 0.7486 (95%CIs: 0.7405-0.7566). The associated predicted probability of increased care at discharge based on the risk groups are shown in the figure. (All p&lt;0.001)

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: About 1 in 7 patients were discharged with increased dependence following liver and pancreas surgery. Among preoperative risk factors for increased care at discharge, frailty and increased age were the strongest predictors. The simplified risk tool can be utilized in clinical practice to guide surgical decision and discharge planning for complex elective surgery.

Few African countries have developed robust and financially sustainable approaches to deliver prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) at scale as traditional high-income country EMS models are financially infeasible. Innovatively re-thinking EMS delivery in resource-limited sub-Saharan African settings is necessary as timely access to emergency care can substantially reduce mortality.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We created the Lay First Responder (LFR) model by capitalizing on pre-existing motorcycle taxi drivers, the predominant form of short-distance transport in sub-Saharan Africa. We launched pilot LFR training programs with 5,173 motorcycle taxi drivers in Uganda, Chad, and Sierra Leone between 2016-2019. The LFR curriculum focuses on scene management, airway/breathing management, bleeding/hemorrhage control, and safe patient transport by motorcycle. We simultaneously studied patient impact and longitudinal skills usage via incident reports, cost via one-way sensitivity analyses, participant emergency care knowledge improvement and retention via pre-/post-course tests, and socioeconomic effects via qualitative semi-structured interviews and income analyses at 1 and 3 years post-course.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: LFRs provided prehospital care and transport in 2,171 patient encounters, decreasing the need for traditional ambulance usage by 92.5%, avoiding costly infrastructure spending while increasing access to care. Locally sourcing first-aid materials reduced cost to ensure long-term item availability, as the mean supply cost per trainee was $6.54USD. Pre-/post-test scores (n=692) in three countries across all four curricular categories demonstrated a mean improvement of 34.2 percentage points (38.7% vs. 72.9%, p&lt;0.001) and significant knowledge retention at 6 months (61%). Using a &quot;Training-of-trainers&quot; (TOT) model increased program sustainability; participants in courses led by local TOT trainers demonstrated pre-/post-test median score (n=150) improvement of 30.4 percentage points (22% vs. 52%, p&lt;0.001). At 3 years post-course, LFRs describe a change in professional identity from transportation providers to &quot;first responders.&quot; Motorcycle taxi participants report increased stature and customer acquisition (24.4% higher income than non-LFR motorcycle taxi counterparts). 75% of initial participants remain voluntarily involved 3 years post-course.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A novel socioeconomic mechanism appears to incentivize long-term voluntary LFR involvement, innovatively sustaining LFR programs in resource-limited African settings. The LFR model may be a sustainable alternative to formal ambulance-reliant EMS that are cost-prohibitive in rural, low-resource settings of low-income countries across sub-Saharan Africa, expanding emergency care to the 91% of the African population without access to EMS.

Cancer outcomes are disparate around the world. Mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs), calculated by dividing cancer mortality rates by incidence rates, have been used to identify disparities in cancer control between populations. We aimed to use MIRs to study disparities in cancer control around the world and identify relationships with country-specific metadata. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We extracted country-specific incidence and mortality rates for 35 cancer types from 183 countries using GLOBACAN 2020. World Development Indicators (WDIs) were obtained from the United Nations Development Programme. Countries were grouped into income categories as defined by the World Bank classification. MIRs were calculated for each cancer in each country and plotted against country development indicators. Multivariable linear regression analyses by cancer type were performed to assess independent associations between MIR and WDIs.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

For all cancers combined, MIRs varied widely across the globe, ranging from 0.33 in Australia to 0.80 in Gambia. However, the variation in MIR was less for certain cancers such a pancreas cancer (range=0.80-1.0). Upon univariate analysis for breast cancer, colon cancer, and all cancers combined, MIRs were significantly associated with education index, gender inequality index, life expectancy index, income index, GDP per capita, internet users, and mobile phone subscriptions (all p&lt;0.001). On multivariable analysis, for screenable cancers such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer, MIRs were significantly associated with life expectancy index (-0.48 [95% CI -0.64, -0.32] and -0.38 [95% CI -0.54, -0.21], respectively) and Income Index (-0.32 [95% CI -0.43, -0.22], -0.35 [95% CI -0.46, -0.24], respectively). Conversely for non-screenable cancers, such as pancreas cancer, MIR was not significantly associated with any WDIs on univariate or multivariable analysis.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

We mapped global disparities in cancer outcomes for each cancer subtype using MIRs. Much of these disparities are explained by country WDIs and vary by cancer subtype. Strengthening health care systems and surgical capacity may decrease specific cancer outcome disparities. These results have significant implications for cancer care prioritization and control around the world.

We aim to develop and validate a clinical risk score for predicting risk of deep sternal wound dehiscence requiring operative debridement and introduce a prophylactic treatment algorithm to guide management of high-risk patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent open cardiac surgery at a single institution between October 2007 and March 2019. Potential risk factors were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and significant covariates were included in a logistic regression prediction model. Interval validation was performed using 10-fold cross-validation. A novel sternal wound dehiscence risk score was derived from the relative parameterization estimates.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 134/8403 patients (1.6%) were identified as having a DSW. Female gender (OR, 2.75; 95% CI, 2.58 - 2.93), body-mass-index (OR,1.0946; 95% CI, 1.09 - 1.09), HbA1c (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.28 - 1.33), peripheral vascular disease (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.2005 - 2.5752), smoking (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.53 - 1.79) and elevated creatinine (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.18 - 1.22) were independent predictors of DSW. Patients were categorized as minimal-risk (0% to 1%), low-risk, (2% to 3%), intermediate-risk (4% to 7%), and high-risk (9% to 64.0%) based on risk score (Figure 1).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Risk factors for the development of deep sternal wound dehiscence following median sternotomy include female gender, elevated HbA1c, obesity, peripheral vascular disease, and tobacco use. The use of the novel sternal dehiscence risk score may help to identify patients who are at high-risk of DSW. Given that many of these identified risk factors are not modifiable in practice, this risk stratification model for DSW requiring operative debridement may provide individualized estimates of risk and guide prophylactic preventative intervention.

Diagnostic imaging is ubiquitous in management of trauma patients in high-income countries; however, imaging capacity in sub-Saharan Africa is severely limited, despite having the highest rates of injury-related morbidity and mortality in the world. Using prospective multi-site trauma registry data from Cameroon, we designated cohorts of patients who did and did not receive prescribed radiologic studies in the Emergency Department (ED). We hypothesize that receiving a prescribed radiologic study in the ED is associated with increased early survival after injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected multi-site trauma registry in Cameroon between 2017 and 2019. All trauma patients, regardless of injury severity, were included in the study. Registrars collected data on patient demographics, injury characteristics, vital signs, diagnostics and treatment provided, deficits in prescribed treatment, reasons a prescribed treatment or diagnostic was not performed, clinical outcomes, and patient disposition through discharge. Cohorts were compared using chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore associations between radiologic testing and survival after injury.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 9,635 injured patients, 47.5% (n = 4,574) were prescribed at least one imaging study. Of these patients, 22.2% did not receive the prescribed study (n = 1,018). Patients who did not receive prescribed studies were younger (p = 0.0198), more commonly male (p = 0.004), and had markers of lower socioeconomic status (p &lt; 0.001) compared to patients who received studies. Multivariate regression demonstrated that receiving a prescribed radiology study was strongly associated with hospital admission (OR 2.99, 95% CI 2.59-3.45) and receipt of additional consultations, procedures, or medical services (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.56-1.97). Adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, injury severity, and presence of chronic medical conditions, multivariate regression found completing a prescribed radiology study to independently predict ED survival (OR 5.28, 95% CI 3.45-8.06). Patients who failed to receive their prescribed radiologic study were more likely to report that cost impeded care than patients who completed imaging (OR 5.98, 95% CI 5.12-6.98); inability to pay was the most frequently reported reason for not receiving a prescribed study (n = 498, 46.2%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Cameroonian patients who received prescribed imaging after injury had an increased likelihood of survival in the ED. In a resource-limited setting, subsidizing access to diagnostic imaging may be a feasible target for improving trauma outcomes.

Anatomic differences in chest shape between cisgender and transgender females require special considerations for primary breast augmentation in these patients. There is one prior case report of an autologous breast reconstruction using deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) free flap reconstruction in a transgender female, but gender-specific considerations and anatomic differences when performing gender affirming DIEP reconstruction are not well understood. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent abdominal Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) at a tertiary care center between 2015 and 2021 was performed. Demographic features were collected including history of tobacco use, prior abdominal surgeries, anticoagulant/antiplatelet use, and history of hormone therapy. CTA images were assessed for subcutaneous fat thickness, rectus abdominus cross sectional area, and DIEP pedicle vessel diameter at the level of the anterior superior iliac spine.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the fifty patients who had imaging of sufficient quality for analysis, there were 15 cisgender female, 14 cisgender male, 9 transgender female, and 10 transgender male patients. The average age was 52.82 +14.17. Cisgender and transgender females had larger subcutaneous fat thickness (3.60 +1.83, 3.67 +1.47), compared to cisgender and transgender males (2.28 +1.30, 3.16 +1.83; p = 0.006, Table 2b). Pedicle vessel diameter was largest in cisgender males and females (3.03 +0.62, 3.09 +0.62) compared to transgender male and females (2.50 +0.50, 2.50 +0.77; p = 0.001, Table 1). 46% of patients had no smoking history and both pedicle diameter and rectus thickness varied by smoking status (p = 0.037, p = 0.020). No significant differences were noted when anatomic parameters were analyzed based on sex at birth (Table 1).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Gender affirming breast surgery with autologous reconstruction requires consideration of both donor and recipient sites. Significant differences were seen in perforator diameter and subcutaneous thickness amongst cis- and transgender patients, with largest pedicle vessel diameters in cisgender patients.

Hypercoagulable patients are uniquely at risk for thrombotic complications during microsurgery that can lead to eventual flap loss. Methods for identifying patients at increased risk for thrombotic events is debated, and many rely on laboratory testing for inherited and acquired hypercoagulable disorders. This study seeks to elucidate the utility of pre-operative laboratory screening for thrombophilias to optimize the algorithm for preventing adverse outcomes in microsurgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively identified patients that underwent free flap operations for breast reconstruction during a 10-year period (2010-2020) at a large academic medical center. Patients were grouped based on whether pre-operative thrombophilia laboratory screening results were ordered. Our institutional practice has been to perform testing in all patients with a personal or family history of thrombosis. Thrombophilia tests evaluated included APCR, Factor VIII, Leiden Factor V Analysis, C Protein, S protein, among others. Procedural outcome was determined by review of intra- and post-operative documentation in a 2-month period following the reconstructive free flap operation. Complications were classified into ischemia, necrosis, partial or full flap failure, hematoma, and presence of thrombus intra-operatively requiring surgical manipulation. Those complications were further stratified between major and minor; major requiring further operations and minor involving additional treatment without operation. Pre-liminary statistical analysis conducted included chi square tests and independent t tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 571 cases of breast reconstruction involving free flap insertion were identified with 78 (13.8%) in the thrombophilia screening cohort. In the thrombophilia screening cohort a total of 59 (75%) patients had at least one abnormal value. There was no significant difference in age, weight, BMI between the thrombophilia screening and control cohorts (p&gt;0.05). The rate of major thrombotic events was not statistically significantly different between the two cohorts; 6.4% for tested patients and 2.6% for patients not tested (p=0.257). There was no statistical significant difference for rate of minor thrombotic events; 19.2% for the thrombophilia group and 19.0% for the control (p=0.095).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: At our institution, retrospective comparison of patients tested and not tested for thrombophilia had identified no statistically significant difference in surgical outcomes. These preliminary results suggest a discrepancy in the utility of these blood panels so early in the patient&rsquo;s pre-operative course when they present complications to the patient&rsquo;s clinical course, such as high costs and potentially limiting their access to insurance. At our institution, we plan to implement a multidisciplinary approach involving hematology to optimize surgical outcomes in this complex patient population.

Although survival after liver transplantation (LT) has been previously described in these children, their waitlist outcomes are unknown. We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics, waitlist outcomes, and post-LT survival between children with HBL and HCC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All pediatric (&lt;18 years) patients with HBL or HCC listed for a first isolated LT (not multiorgan) between 02/2002-09/2020 in the United Network for Organ Sharing database were included. Waitlist outcomes were examined using Fine-Gray competing risks regression (main risk/outcome: waitlist mortality defined as death/delisting due to being too sick; competing risk/outcome: LT). Post-LT patient and graft survival were examined using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 668 children with HBL and 95 children with HCC listed for a first isolated LT were identified. Children with HBL were listed younger than children with HCC (P&lt;0.001), had lower laboratory MELD/PELD scores (P&lt;0.001), and had encephalopathy less often (P=0.01). Children with HCC demonstrated an increased risk of unadjusted waitlist mortality compared to children with HBL (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR]=4.37, 95%CI, 2.01-9.51, P&lt;0.001; Figure A). This effect persisted in multivariable competing risk regression with children with HCC demonstrating three times higher risk of waitlist mortality compared to children with HBL (adjusted sHR=3.08, 95%CI, 1.13-8.37, P=0.03), when adjusted for age and laboratory MELD/PELD score at listing. A total of 595 children with HBL and 76 children with HCC underwent a first isolated LT. Similar differences were appreciated in clinical characteristics as with the waitlist cohort. 71.3% of the children with HBL had a status 1B exception compared to only 7.9% of the children with HCC (P&lt;0.001). No difference was observed in unadjusted patient (P=0.52; Figure B) and graft survival (P=0.93; Figure C) between HCC and HBL. The 5-year patient and graft survival for HBL versus HCC was 82.0% versus 78.0%, and 75.9% versus 74.7%, respectively. Multivariable Cox regression failed to demonstrate differences in either patient survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=0.77, 95%CI, 0.40-1.48, P=0.43) or graft survival (adjusted HR=0.74, 95%CI, 0.42-1.33, P=0.32) between HCC and HBL, when adjusted for age, laboratory MELD/PELD score at LT, and graft type.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Given the similar post-LT survival outcomes, changes in waitlist prioritization could be considered to mitigate the disparities in waitlist mortality between children with HBL and HCC.

Less than 13% of patients diagnosed with End Stage Kidney Disease join the kidney transplant waitlist. Socioeconomic factors such as access to transportation, ability to leave work, and financial stability have been associated with low evaluation completion rates. After a referral is placed for kidney transplant evaluation, patients receive calls and letters from the transplant center to initiate the process. If engagement is unsuccessful, the referral is often closed. Little is known about this group of patients. The aim of this investigation is to assess the socioeconomic deprivation of patients referred for kidney transplantation who never started the transplant process.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Single center retrospective cohort study of all referrals for kidney transplantation between 2014-2018 which were &ldquo;closed for no contact&rdquo; (internal designation of referrals with failed initial engagement). Nine-digit zip codes for each record were analyzed using the Area Deprivation Index, a validated hierarchical compositive measure of socioeconomic deprivation which accounts for neighborhood-specific factors such as income, education and employment. State deciles (1-10) and national percentiles (1-100) of deprivation were calculated for each closed referral. Higher values for both scales correspond to higher deprivation areas. Patients living in group quarters were excluded from the analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1,522 unique referrals from patients living in 35 states were identified. Nine patients lived in group quarters. The most common state of permanent residence was Michigan (n=1,303), followed by Ohio (n=42), Florida (n=21), Illinois (n=18), and Indiana (n=18). The mean (SD) state area deprivation index decile was 5.9 (&plusmn; 2.9), and the mean national percentile was 58.9 (&plusmn;27.2). The most common Area Deprivation Index percentile in the sample was 100th (n=54), followed by 98th percentile (n=46), 99th (n=40), 95th (n-37), and 97th (n=35). The least common Area Deprivation Index percentiles were 3rd (n=2), 11th (n=2), 14th (n=2), and 18th (n=2). A Shapiro-Wilk test showed a significant departure from normality for the sample distribution, W=0.95, p=0.00.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients who were &ldquo;closed for no contact&rdquo; disproportionally resided in neighborhoods with higher structural disadvantage. Interventions are needed to support early engagement of socially vulnerable patients with the kidney transplant evaluation process.

Due to underlying renal dysfunction, CKLT recipients tend have higher medical acuity at baseline resulting in a higher likelihood of post-operative complications and graft dysfunction. Our prior study, based on data from two high volume centers, suggests that pulsatile kidney perfusion may decrease delayed graft function (DGF) and improve kidney graft survival, especially in sicker patients, by allowing delayed kidney implantation following liver transplant. Kidney perfusion appears especially beneficial for grafts with longer cold ischemia (CIT). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether center-level observations were applicable to all patients receiving CKLT in the US and to analyze the subgroups that might benefit most from pre-transplant kidney machine perfusion in CKLT. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The OPTN database was queried for all adult CLKT from 2003-2017. Data was analyzed for recipient survival and delayed graft function (DGF) in patients receiving pumped (pCLKT) versus non-pumped (nCLKT) kidneys. Study groups were stratified by medical acuity (Model for End-State Liver Disease [MELD]) and duration of kidney CIT. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:4421 CKLT recipients were identified of which 24% received pCLKT and 76% received nCLKT kidneys. Median biologic MELD was 29 for both groups (p=0.7), and donor and recipient characteristics did not differ significantly. Overall patient survival was similar between groups, with 1- and 5-year mortality of 12.4% and 43.7% for pCLKT, and 14.8% and 40.1% for nCLKT (p=0.07); whereas, DGF occurred less frequently in pCLKT recipients (18% vs. 22%, p&lt;0.0001). Subgroup analysis was performed considering only recipients with 24-36h kidney CIT (&gt;24h). In CLKT recipients with longer cold ischemia time (&gt;24h), 1yr mortality (13% pCLKT vs 26% nCLKT, p=0.03) and the incidence of DGF (26% pCLKT vs 48.1% nCLKT, p=0.002) were significantly better among recipients of pCLKT. In stratifying by medical acuity (MELD) at transplant, only patients with high MELD &gt;35 at transplant demonstrated improved 1-year mortality (10.9% pCLKT vs 16.8% nCLKT, p=0.04) and DGF (19.9% pCLKT vs 24.4% nCLKT, p=0.002). In comparison, there was no significant difference in 1 yr mortality or DGF for patients with MELD 25-30 or MELD &lt;25 receiving either pCLKT or nCLKT. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The benefit of kidney machine perfusion in CLKT has been the subject of much debate, and it is not routinely employed. These data suggest that while machine perfusion likely improves immediate kidney function, it does not necessarily benefit survival in all comers. However, for kidneys that might be subject to prolonged cold ischemia (eg hemodynamic instability or bleeding following liver implant) or for patients with high medical acuity at the time of transplant (ie high MELD), there is a substantial benefit both in immediate kidney allograft function and in overall patient mortality that is incurred by perioperative pumping of the kidney during CLKT.

Identifying markers of progressive/severe IRI would optimize graft monitoring and provide markers for targeted intervention. We sought to identify and compare perioperative biomarkers of liver and biliary injury following HMP-O<sub>2</sub> vs standard of care cold storage (SCS). 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients were transplanted at a single center as part of the PILOT trial (NCT03484455), the first prospective, multi-center randomized controlled trial of hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion in the US. Livers were randomized to perfusion (HMP-O<sub>2</sub>)<sub> </sub>using the LifePort Liver Transporter (ORS, Itasca, IL) or to SCS. Preservation fluid (effluent) was collected prior to implantation. Bile duct (BD) and bile were collected 1hr post reperfusion. Effluent biochemistry was assessed via Luminex, and bile biochemistry via iSTAT-1/CG8<sup>+</sup>. Markers of tissue injury were identified by immunohistochemistry (IHC). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Liver transplant was performed in 20 patients (7 HMP-O<sub>2 ; </sub>13<sub> </sub>SCS). Baseline donor and recipient characteristics were similar between groups. Cold time was significantly longer for HMP-O<sub>2</sub> vs SCS (6.9&plusmn;0.9 vs 5.4&plusmn;1, p&lt;0.001). Early allograft dysfunction (EAD) occurred in three cases, all SCS. HMP-O<sub>2</sub> resulted in fewer post-operative complications: fewer re-admissions, re-interventions, and biliary complications (Comprehensive Complication Index, 42 vs 56, p&lt;0.05). Multiplex biomarker analysis of effluent showed attenuated expression of canonical inflammatory markers (MIP-1&szlig;, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, TNF&alpha; ) following HMP-O<sub>2</sub> (Figure 1). Cholangiocyte function, reflected by lower bile glucose, was preserved post HMP-O<sub>2</sub> vs SCS (55 vs 156 mg/dL, p&lt;0.05). IHC of BD tissue demonstrated attenuated activation of inflammation (NF-&kappa;&szlig;, p=0.4), reactive proliferation (Ki-67, p&lt;0.05), and necroptosis (RIP-3, p&lt;0.05) following HMP-O<sub>2</sub>, suggesting decreased biliary injury. The most intense staining was noted in an SCS case which developed biliary leak and anastomotic breakdown. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: HMP-O<sub>2</sub> provides safe and effective preservation for liver allografts. Perfusion decreases inflammatory signaling, reactive tissue proliferation, and tissue necroptosis. This likely confers protection from IRI and leads to improved post-transplant outcomes. The novel application of multiplex assessment of effluent may identify biomarkers of early injury for targeted intervention to improve liver transplant outcomes.

Variations in apolipoprotein L1 (ApoL1) confer a higher lifetime risk of kidney disease in African Americans (AA). The discovery of this gene has raised important ethical and clinical questions about ApoL1 testing in the context of living kidney donation and kidney transplantation. Largely missing from this discussion are the perspectives of living kidney donors (LKDs) and transplant (Tx) patients who are most likely to be impacted by ApoL1 testing.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A total of 331 AA LKDs (67 potential LKDs and 32 former LKDs), kidney Tx patients (84 candidates and 78 recipients), and nonpatients (70 community members) were recruited at three Tx programs in the USA to complete a survey about ApoL1 testing, decision-making in the context of ApoL1 high-risk genotype, and disclosure of ApoL1 test findings. Also, we measured sociodemographic characteristics and potentially important cofactors, including AA identity, health literacy, ApoL1 knowledge, risk perceptions, beliefs about genetics, and healthcare system distrust. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all survey items. Chi Square Test and T Test were used to assess relationships between cofactors and willingness to undergo ApoL1 testing (potential LKDs), and willingness to receive a kidney from a LKD with high-risk ApoL1 genotype (Tx candidates).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Overall, 72% felt that Tx programs should offer ApoL1 testing to AA potential LKDs; 15% believed that testing should be required. If a potential LKD has the high-risk genotype, 79% felt that the LKD should be allowed to make their own donation decision or participate in shared decision-making with Tx doctors; 21% felt that a potential LKD with the high-risk genotype should be excluded from donation. Most (81%) felt the Tx candidate has a right to know their LKD&rsquo;s ApoL1 genotype. There were no significant differences based on participant type (all p values&gt;0.05). Most former LKDs (81%) would undergo ApoL1 testing now if it was offered. More than half of potential LKDs (58%) would undergo ApoL1 testing during their current evaluation; those with high genetics self-efficacy were more willing to undergo testing, compared to those with low self-efficacy (66% vs. 44%, p=0.02). Most Tx candidates (79%) would not accept a kidney from a LKD with the high-risk genotype, even if all other donation eligibility criteria were met; those with more healthcare system distrust were less willing to accept a kidney from a LKD with the high-risk genotype (23.6 vs. 20.9, p=0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

There is strong support among LKDs, Tx patients, and nonpatients for ApoL1 testing when evaluating potential LKDs of African ancestry. Many Tx programs currently exclude potential LKDs with the high-risk ApoL1 genotype, which is not generally supported by study participants. Inclusion of these key AA stakeholders in developing guidelines and educational programs for ApoL1 testing of potential LKDs is critical.

For patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney transplant (KT) has several advantages over dialysis, including patient survival and quality of life. In 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded reimbursement for educating patients about KT and amended the Medical Evidence Form (CMS-2728) to include a question about the provision of KT information. The purpose of this study was to quantify the provision of transplant information at the time of dialysis, to identify the risk factors for not receiving information, and to explore the association between information and likelihood of waitlist and KT.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This was a retrospective analysis of patients 18 or older with a CMS-2728 filed between 1/1/2008 to 1/1/2019 using data from the United States Renal Data System database. The primary outcome was provision of information. Secondary outcomes were reasons for not being informed, addition to the transplant waitlist and transplant rate. Logistic regression models were constructed to determine the association between sociodemographic/clinical risk factors and informed status and the reasons for being uninformed. Cox proportional-hazards models were constructed to estimate the likelihood of waitlist and transplant for all patients.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Between 2008 and 2019, 1,209,147 patients had a CMS-2728 form filed. Of these, 213,214 (18%) did not receive information about KT. Patients with the lowest rates of being informed included those unable to ambulate (67.9%), needing daily assistance (71.7%), and those of age &gt;70 (73%). Female patients were more likely to be deemed unsuitable due to age (26% vs 23% male, 95% CIs 25.88-26.45 and 22.72-23.20, respectively). White patients were more likely to be considered medically unfit (38% vs 29% Black, 95% CIs 37.39-37.93 and 28.98-29.77, respectively), while Black patients were declined information due to psychological unfitness at a higher percentage than other racial groups. The most common reasons for not receiving information were &ldquo;not assessed&rdquo; (42%) followed by &ldquo;medically unfit&rdquo; (24%). Being informed (hazards ratio [HR] 1.67, 95% CI 1.63-1.70), access to nephrology care (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.40-1.44), and male sex (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.17-1.20) had the greatest impact on the likelihood of getting waitlisted within one year. Minority patients had significantly lower likelihood of getting a transplant after being on the waitlist compared to White patients.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Sociodemographic status and clinical characteristics remain significant risk factors for not receiving information about KT. Being uninformed is a risk factor for being less likely to be waitlisted and transplanted. Efforts should be focused on ensuring fair access to information for all patients.

Alemayehu<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of South Alabama, Pediatric Surgery, Mobile, AL, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of South Alabama, General Surgery, Mobile, AL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Timing of ostomy reversal in premature infants continues to be controversial, with concerns regarding strictures and overall complication rates when enterostomy closure is performed on neonates weighing less than 2 kg. However, some neonates with high output ostomies and failure to gain weight may require early reversal. This is especially pertinent in extremely premature infants. The aim of this study is to investigate differences in patient outcomes based on weight at the time of enterostomy reversal.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This study is a retrospective review of medical records at a single institution between 2018 and 2020 comparing outcomes following ostomy reversal in neonates weighing less than 2 kg to those weighing 2 kg or greater. All neonates less than 90 days at initial operation who underwent exploratory laparotomy and enterostomy formation secondary to any pathology were included. Neonates who were greater than 90 days at initial exploratory abdominal surgery, suffered mortality prior to enterostomy closure, or were not treated with an enterostomy at the index operation were excluded. Patient demographics, initial operative intervention, weight at stoma takedown, duration between index operation and stoma takedown, and outcomes and complications after enterostomy reversal were reviewed and recorded. Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses were performed using Student&rsquo;s T-test for continuous variables and Chi-square with Yates&rsquo; correction or Fischer&rsquo;s Exact Test for categorical variables. All results reported as means (+/- standard deviation) or medians (+/- interquartile range) for non-normally distributed variables.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Twenty-seven neonates met inclusion criteria during the study period. Sixteen (59%) were male and the mean age at time of index operation was 6 days (+/- 12 days). The mean gestational age was 27 weeks (+/- 4.4 weeks), and the mean birth weight was 833 g (+/- 420 g). Thirteen neonates (48%) had stoma takedown at less than 2 kg and 14 (52%) had stoma takedown at greater than 2 kg. The less than 2 kg group and the greater than 2 kg group had similar gestational age (p=0.09) and birth weight (p=0.08). There was no difference in the time between the initial operation and ostomy reversal (p = 0.36), time to initiation of feeds (p = 0.88), time to full feeds (p = 0.82), duration on the ventilator (p = 0.82), or post-operative length of stay (p = 0.68). There was also no difference in overall complication rate; the less than 2 kg group had a 15% (n=2) complication rate and the greater than 2 kg group had a 21% (n=3) complication rate, (p = 0.93). Complications included anastomotic stricture and small bowel obstruction.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
No association was found between outcomes and neonate weight at the time of enterostomy closure. Therefore, this study concludes that when clinically necessary, enterostomy closure can be safely performed on premature infants weighing less than 2 kg.

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) for thyroid nodules is not well-tolerated in children without sedation or anesthesia. Postoperative pathologic analysis may require a return to the operating room for completion thyroidectomy or nodal clearance. We present a novel intraoperative collaboration between surgery and pathology in which FNA is completed in the operating room at the time of thyroid lobectomy. We hypothesize that this technique provides a sensitive, efficient, and safe approach to guide surgical resection that could avoid preoperative FNA or the need for subsequent operations.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Intraoperative FNA was completed by the surgeon at the time of thyroid lobectomy. The specimen was passed to the pathologist who completed microscopic evaluation with a mobile pathology cart in the operating room, providing results within minutes as the surgeon continued the dissection. This novel technique is reviewed retrospectively to determine the primary outcome of thyroid reoperation associated with the use of intraoperative FNA. All patients who underwent thyroid resection from 2016-2019 at our tertiary children&rsquo;s hospital were considered. We collected information on demographics, preoperative work-up, intraoperative FNA cytology, surgical pathology, and the need for reoperation. Secondary outcomes were the concordance rates between intraoperative cytology and final surgical pathology and the proportion of patients whose preoperative FNA could have been replaced with an intraoperative FNA.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Over three years, 47 patients underwent thyroid surgery at our institution (36 total or subtotal thyroidectomies, 11 lobectomies, and 3 completion thyroidectomies). Seven patients underwent intraoperative FNA. Their mean age was 16.2 years; all (100%) were female. Four patients had preoperative FNAs suspicious for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Three of these patients had intraoperative FNAs that were diagnostic of PTC and therefore underwent total thyroidectomy at their index surgery. One patient required completion thyroidectomy. Intraoperative cytology was concordant with final surgical pathology in six of seven cases, an 85.7% concordance rate. Nineteen patients from the total cohort underwent preoperative FNA. Based on clinical presentation and preoperative imaging, all 19 of these preoperative FNAs (100.0%) could potentially have been avoided in favor of intraoperative FNA only. There were no complications with the intraoperative FNA or with the thyroidectomies. Median postoperative length of stay was 1.0 days (range 1.0-4.0 days).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Intraoperative FNA is a previously unreported strategy in the surgical management of pediatric thyroid disease. In this initial study, we have shown that utilization of this tool is a sensitive, safe, and reliable method that could save children from traumatic awake FNAs and prevent repeat exposure to anesthesia and subsequent operations. Further study is required to optimize its clinical application.

The objective of this study was to analyze racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in girls undergoing surgical excision of a breast mass.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective study of females aged 10 to 21 years who underwent surgery for a breast lesion across eleven pediatric hospitals from 2011 to 2016 was performed. Differences in patient characteristics, workup, management, and pathology by race/ethnicity and insurance status were evaluated with chi-squared tests, T-tests, and Wilcoxon Mann Whitney tests.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

Four-hundred and fifty-four females were included, with a median age of 16 years (IQR: 3). Forty-four percent of patients were non-Hispanic Black, 40% were non-Hispanic White, and 7% were Hispanic. Half of patients (50%) had private insurance, 39% had public insurance, and 9% were uninsured. All patients underwent breast-conserving treatment and the median mass size on pathology was 3.5 cm (IQR: 2.4).

Masses in NH Black patients were larger on pathology than in NH White patients (4.3 cm vs 3.9 cm, p=0.001); however, size was more likely to be the reason for excision in Asian and Hispanic patients (p=0.002). Symptoms, including pain, were more likely to be the reason for excision in Black and Other patients (p=0.004). We did not observe differences by race/ethnicity in the time to surgery from the initial imaging study or initial surgery consult, or differences in final pathology.

Patients with public insurance were less likely to undergo core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration (5%) compared to privately insured patients (15%) or patients with no insurance (30%, p&lt;0.0001). We did not observe differences by payer in the time to surgery from the initial imaging study or the initial surgery consult. Mean mass size in patients with public insurance was 4.3 cm compared to 3.8 cm in patients with private insurance (p=0.03).



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There were no differences by race/ethnicity and insurance type in time to surgery after surgical consultation in girls undergoing excision of a breast mass. However, there were differences across race/ethnicity and insurance type in various aspects of the presentation, workup, and indication for surgery, suggesting that exploring differences in care prior to surgical referral is warranted.

Van Arendonk<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Medical College Of Wisconsin, Division Of Pediatric Surgery, Milwaukee, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Telemedicine (TM), a potential tool for enhancing access to care, has been introduced in a variety of surgical fields and has accelerated in use out of necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The adequacy and feasibility of TM across all visit types and demographic groups within the pediatric surgery field is unclear. This study investigated the utilization of video-based TM visits and compared the adequacy of TM versus in-person (IP) visits, with a focus on post-operative (PO) visits thought to be most amenable to completion via TM. 
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All pediatric surgery clinic encounters from 1/2020-3/2021 at seven outpatient clinics associated with a large academic children&rsquo;s hospital were evaluated with regard to type, adequacy, and outcome of the visits. Patients utilizing TM versus IP visits were compared according to basic demographics, as well as travel distance and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status as determined from home addresses. Subgroup analysis examined PO visits after appendectomy and inguinal, umbilical, and epigastric hernia repairs, for which TM was routinely offered. These patients were also provided the opportunity to cancel PO visits via electronic communication in the absence of any PO concerns.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 9,149 scheduled visits, 87.9% were IP and 12.1% were TM. TM visits were scheduled for PO care (76.9%), new patients (7.1%), and established patients (16.0%). TM use quickly increased after pandemic onset in 3/2020 and peaked in 4/2020 with 33% of all completed visits and 75% of completed PO visits (Figure 1). Compared to IP visits, TM visits were more frequently canceled (43.2% vs. 34.9%, p&lt;0.001) or no-shows (14.2% vs. 7.7%, p&lt;0.001). Most of the canceled TM visits (50.8%) were PO visits, of which 41.7% were approved for cancellation through communication with the surgical team. Among all PO TM visits (n=851), 98.2% were adequate, with just 1 (0.4%) requiring an IP visit and 4 (1.5%) experiencing technical challenges. For the PO patients routinely offered TM visits (n=653), those completing TM visits were more frequently white (59.8% vs. 44.1%, p=0.005), privately insured (66.3% vs. 48.4%, p&lt;0.001), from more affluent neighborhoods (45.6% vs. 30.7% in the 4 most affluent deciles, p &lt;0.001), and with greater travel distance (median 12.4 vs. 8.2 miles, p&lt;0.001).
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: TM use increased during the pandemic, predominantly for PO visits. TM visits, or simple electronic communication reporting the absence of PO concerns, was adequate for the majority of basic PO visits. TM was used more by patients with greater travel and less by those of minority race, with public insurance, and from less affluent neighborhoods, questioning the feasibility of TM among disadvantaged children.

Non-contrast MRI has excellent sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing appendicitis, spares the ionizing radiation of computed tomography (CT), which may increase cancer risk, and is operator-independent. However, MRI incurs greater upfront cost.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We compare clinical outcomes and hospital charge data associated with different treatment algorithms for the diagnosis of appendicitis at two neighboring children&rsquo;s hospitals serving a state of 4.14 million residents. Hospital A&rsquo;s algorithm involves the use of MRI after equivocal US, most often characterized by non-visualization of the appendix. Hospital B&rsquo;s algorithm involves admission for observation with or without serial US. Patients ages 0 to 18 who presented to the Emergency Departments of hospitals A and B with suspected appendicitis between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020, were included. Data were obtained via electronic medical record review and from Epic data warehouses.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: At hospital A, 330 children underwent MRI after equivocal US. Median length-of-stay (LOS) was 8 hours and median hospital charges were $4,605. At hospital B, 81 children underwent clinical observation with or without repeat US. Median LOS was 19 hours and median hospital charges were $13,112. There were no significant differences between cohorts with respect to age, Alvarado score or payer mix. Differences in LOS and hospital charges were significant (p&lt;0.05). Four of 330 (0.02%) children at hospital A returned within 24 hours for uncomplicated appendectomy after over-read of their MRI. No children at hospital B returned for appendectomy. A majority of children in both cohorts were ultimately diagnosed with constipation, gastroenteritis, mesenteric adenitis or abdominal pain not-otherwise-specified.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: MRI is safe and cost-effective for excluding appendicitis in children. Our results extend the conclusions of comparable studies, which have previously relied on average charges or theoretical modeling rather than actual cost data.

Gunnells<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Obesity, age, and male sex have been identified as an independent risk factor for susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 infection. The impact of COVID-19 infection on surgical patients is largely described by small cohort studies. We aimed to characterize risk factors for post-operative mortality (POM) among patients who had a pre-operative COVID-19 infection.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patient data was abstracted from the electronic medical record at a single large tertiary hospital for patients who had a positive COVID-19 test prior to surgery (case, Mar 2020 &ndash; April 2021). Only procedures with specialties tracked with ACS-NSQIP were included. Procedures related to ECMO were excluded. Mortality was compared to patients from the ACS-NSQIP database (control, Jan 2018-Feb 2020). Patient and procedure level data was analyzed with Chi-square and ANOVA tests and multivariable regression to predict mortality. A separate analysis was performed for the case cohort to determine predictors of POM.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There were 5,424 patients in the control cohort and 1,611 patients who had a positive COVID-19 test prior to surgery. Only 452 had surgeries with specialties tracked by ACS-NSQIP. The overall population was 40% male and 29% Black with a mean age of 58 yr (SD=15 yr). Mean BMI was 30 (SD=7.8). Most surgeries were with General Surgery (45%). Patients tested positive 0-283 days before surgery (median: 12 days, mean: 44 days. Overall POM was 1.7%. Patients with a prior COVID-19 infection were more likely to be younger (50 vs 59 yr, p&lt;0.001), male (53% vs 39%, p&lt;0.001), Black (40% vs 28%, p&lt;0.001), and have a lower BMI (29 vs 30, p=0.006). These surgeries were more emergent (84% vs 17%, p&lt;0.001), and more often with Orthopedics (28% vs 18%) and Vascular (15% vs 8%, p&lt;0.001).

POM was greater among the case cohort (9% vs 1%, p&lt;0.001). On logistic regression, POM increased with age (OR:1.02, 95%CI:1.01-1.04), male sex (OR:1.8, 95%CI:1.1-2.8), Black race (OR:1.4, 95%CI:0.9-2.2), BMI (OR:1.03, 95%CI:1.01-1.06), and prior COVID-19 infection (OR:6.6, 95%CI:3.8-11.6, see Fig). POM was lower for elective surgeries (OR:0.3, 95%CI:0.2-0.5) and varied by specialty (p&lt;0.001) but remained consistent throughout the months (p=0.82). Among patients with prior COVID-19 infection, POM was predicted by male sex (OR:4.4, 95%CI:1.8-11.1) and BMI (OR:1.08, 95% CI:1.03-1.1).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
POM is six times higher for patients previously infected with COVID-19 when adjusting for patient and procedure level factors. Among those with prior COVID-19 infection, risk of POM is predicted by specialty, male sex, and increases in age and BMI. Future studies with increased sample size and adjustment for patient comorbidities will reduce confounding factors.

Dellonte<sup>1</sup>, M. Sandler<sup>1</sup>, D. Wakeman<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Child physical abuse (non-accidental trauma) is a significant cause of traumatic injury and death for children in the United States. Previous studies have described disparities in outcomes of pediatric trauma patients generally (including both accidental trauma and child physical abuse) according to race and insurance status. We hypothesized that beyond these variables, more granular community level socioeconomic risk factors are a potentially under-measured driver of child physical abuse and adverse outcomes in physically abused children.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Following institutional review board approval, a retrospective review of children who were admitted with suspected or confirmed child physical abuse between January 2011 and January 2021 at a single institution was performed. Injury severity score, injury patterns, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and mortality were collected from our institution&rsquo;s prospectively maintained trauma database. Home address at the time of admission was obtained from the electronic medical record. Children living at an address not coded in the 2015 American Community Survey were excluded. Patients&rsquo; Area Deprivation Index was tabulated utilizing the patient&#39;s census tract or block group. Higher Area Deprivation Index indicates a community with fewer resources with 50 set as the mean. Univariate statistics were compared with the student&rsquo;s T-test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 192 patients were included for analysis. Average age was 2.1 years. Mean Area Deprivation Index was 77 (median 82). Patients living in communities above the 50th percentile for area deprivation index were more likely to present with a higher injury severity score as compared to patients from communities below the 50th percentile (mean 12.2 vs. 10.1, p=0.03). Furthermore, patients from communities above the 50th percentile area deprivation index tended to be admitted to the ICU more often following child physical abuse than patients from the bottom 50th percentile (47.3% vs. 35.0%, p=0.09). Finally, the mortality rate was 7% among patients from the highest 50th percentile area deprivation index compared to 3% for children from below the 50th percentile.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In our region of the United States, children who experience suspected or confirmed child physical abuse live in more disadvantaged communities. Community level deprivation indices may predict a patient&rsquo;s individual risk of experiencing more severe outcomes, such as ICU stay and death, following child physical abuse. These findings may provide valuable insight as to which families may benefit from additional resources, outreach, or other interventions in an effort to prevent and ameliorate the devastating impacts of child physical abuse.

Lurie Childrens Hospital Of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic created tremendous demand on hospitals across the country. At the pandemic outset, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Association (CHA) published recommendations for consolidation of acute pediatric care to pediatric hospitals, thus creating capacity for COVID-19 patients in adult hospitals. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of this adaptation on pediatric trauma centers (PTCs).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study evaluating patients &lt;18 years old with traumatic injuries, who met NTDB inclusion criteria and were transferred to a Level 1 pediatric trauma center. &ldquo;Historical&rdquo; controls from an averaged period of January-September 2016-2019 were compared to patients injured from January through September 2020 (&ldquo;COVID&rdquo; cohort).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 9 Level I pediatric trauma centers participated, contributing 39,326 pediatric trauma patients, of which 22,693 (58%) were transferred from an outlying facility. In 2020, there was an increase in the number of transferred pediatric trauma patients, Figure 1. Additionally, the proportion of patients with an ISS &lt;15 was 89% in the historical cohort compared to 94% in the COVID cohort, p&lt;0.001. A higher proportion of transferred patients were discharged home from the Emergency Department (ED) in the COVID cohort when compared to the Historical control (27.5% historical vs. 38.4% COVID, p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: An unintended consequence of the pandemic was an increased burden of less severely injured pediatric trauma patients on PTCs. Consideration should be given to capacity building through the development of Level 3 and 4 PTCs to care for these lower acuity patients, thus allowing for more severely injured children to be triaged to a higher-level PTC.

Both provider- and patient-level factors may contribute to persistent utilization. However, variation in utilization at the facility level is unknown. We aimed to identify facility-level factors that may contribute to overuse of these low-value services.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Michigan Value Collaborative, a statewide claims-based registry. The cohort included women &ge;70 years old diagnosed with breast cancer who underwent breast conserving surgery (BCS) from 01/01/2012 to 12/31/2019 at 80 hospitals in Michigan. We excluded women who underwent complete axillary dissection, mastectomy, and/or received chemotherapy. Facility factors analyzed were location by core-based statistical area, hospital volume, bed size, American College of Surgeons (ACS)-approved cancer center status, teaching status, and profit status. The main outcome measures were facility-level rates of SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy. Statistical tests were performed using SAS statistical software with significance defined as p&lt;0.050.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 7,253 women &ge;70 years old underwent BCS. Of these women, 20% (n=1,440) received BCS alone, 28% (n=2,020) received BCS + SLNB, 10% (n=691) received BCS + radiotherapy, and 43% (n=3,102) received BCS + SLNB + radiotherapy. Inter-facility reliability-adjusted rates of SLNB ranged from 35% to 82% with a median of 70% (IQR 62%, 74%). Adjuvant radiotherapy ranged from 19% to 72% with a median of 49% (IQR 42%, 60%). Intra-facility utilization of SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy was positively correlated (Figure 1, r=0.27, p=0.016). Facility factors significantly associated with SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy utilization were low volume (&lt;100 cases vs. 100-199 cases vs. &ge;200 cases), smaller bed size (&lt;200 beds vs. 200-499 beds vs. &ge;500 beds), ACS-approved cancer center status, and for-profit status (all p&lt;0.001).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We demonstrate that receipt of SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy in women potentially eligible for omission remains high at 71% and 52%, respectively. Inter-facility rates of these low-value breast cancer procedures varied widely, and facilities with high utilization of SLNB were likely to have high utilization of adjuvant radiotherapy. These findings may be the result of local practice patterns or dominant clinicians. Future de-implementation strategies must look beyond patient-level factors to target high-use facilities and their clinicians.

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the relationship between complications and 30-day mortality (failure to rescue) after these procedures. We sought to analyze comparative failure to rescue (FTR) after these commonly performed carotid interventions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients undergoing CEA and CAS were identified from the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database from 2010 to 2016. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to control for demographic and pre-operative characteristics between the groups. Univariate analysis was performed comparing clinical/operative characteristics and 30-day outcomes. Multivariate analysis was performed analyzing the occurrence of complications and their association with 30-day mortality. Logistic regression model was performed, in which the procedure (CEA vs. CAS) was applied as an independent variable.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 76,147 patients were identified (74,502 CEA, 1,646 CAS). After PSM, 1,498 CEA and 1,498 CAS patients were included in the final analysis. There were no differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. CEA patients were more likely to have experienced wound infections (0.9% CEA vs 0.2% CAS, OR 0.21(0.06-0.74)), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (1.6% CEA vs 0.7% CAS, OR 0.45(0.22-0.93)), and septic complications (3.5% CEA vs 1.7% CAS, OR 0.48(0.30-0.77)). There was no difference in terms of bleeding requiring transfusion, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and composite death, CVA, and myocardial infarction (DSMI). Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and septic complications were associated with 30-day mortality in both groups. (p&lt;0.05), but 30-day mortality for these two post-operative complications was almost three times greater after CEA than CAS ([MACE: OR 61.0(12.2-195.0) CEA vs OR 18.5(4.9-70.2) CAS], [septic complications: OR 31.3(10.5-92.8) CEA vs OR 13.6(3.7-50.5) CAS]). Failure-to-rescue from HAP was 1.5-fold greater after CEA than CAS (OR 61.0(12.2-195.0) CEA vs OR 39.5(9.5-164.5) CAS). Failure to rescue from CVA and unplanned tracheal intubation was similar between the groups ([CVA: OR 30.7(11.0-85.7) CAS vs OR 24.3(7.1-83.1) CEA], [Unplanned tracheal intubation: OR 72.9(22.9-232.1) CAS vs OR 73.5(22.7-237.7) CEA]).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: After matching for demographic and clinical characteristics, MACE and septic complications were associated with 30-day mortality for both CEA and CAS. However, the failure to rescue from these complications was three times greater for CEA. Failure to rescue from HAP was 1.5-fold greater for CEA, as well. Early recognition and aggressive management of these complications are warranted.

Weakness (or low grip strength) is associated with decreased survival, increased morbidity, and sarcopenia among patients with vascular disease. Prevalence of categorical weakness is 25-30% among patients with vascular disease, but whether screening leads to recognition or documentation of this diagnosis is unknown. We implemented grip strength screening in outpatient cardiovascular specialist clinics and compared coding prevalence of age-related physical debility between patients evaluated with grip strength measurement versus not.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Grip strength measurement was implemented in select outpatient cardiovascular clinics at a single location within an academic healthcare system in May 2019. Grip strength was measured in kilograms during pre-rooming check-in using hydraulic hand dynamometers, recorded in kilograms, and recorded as a discrete data element within the electronic medical record (EMR) . An EMR system smartphrase supported clinician interpretation and documentation, with functionality to import grip strength values into progress notes alongside a table permitting categorization of patients as weak or not based on gender and body mass index (Figure 1). Patients undergoing major vascular operations post-implementation were identified based on general anesthesia in combination with aortic, carotid, extremity, mesenteric, or renal arterial procedures or extremity amputation. Prevalence of grip strength measurement was tracked using EMR reports and compared to frailty diagnosis based on ICD-10-CM code R54 (age-related physical debility). Associations between grip strength measurement and coding were evaluated using logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1590 patients were identified who underwent major vascular operations during the study period from May 2019- August 2021, of whom grip strength measurement was obtained from 403 (25.4%). Prevalence of ICD-10-CM R54 was 1.8% overall, and was significantly greater among patients screened with grip strength (4.0%) versus not (1.1%) [OR 3.7; 95% CI (1.8-7.8); P&lt;0.0005].

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Grip strength screening was associated with increased clinician coding of age-related physical debility among patients undergoing major vascular operations, although coding prevalence remained well below population prevalence of categorical weakness. Future research will explore influences of grip strength measurement and related categorization of patients as weak and/or frail versus not on treatment selection and outcomes, and implementation strategies to further increase clinician awareness and integration into treatment selection.

Medicaid coverage of podiatry is optional and has previously been eliminated by individual states during periods of austerity. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of state podiatry coverage and outcomes of Medicaid beneficiaries with a new diabetic foot ulcer (DFU).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Medicaid beneficiaries with new incidence DFU (2010 to 2016) were identified using the Pearl Diver Claim Database. We categorized states into covered states (CS) and non-covered states (NCS). Patients were followed until December 31, 2017 for major amputation, minor amputation, and hospitalization for foot infection. Logistic regression was performed to examine association of state type on the risks of amputation and hospitalizations for diabetic foot infection, controlling for age, gender, Charleston Comorbidity Index (CCI), and medical comorbidities.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We included 16,905 Medicaid beneficiaries with new DFUs from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2016, in covered states (n=14,748) and non-covered states (n=2,157). The overall rate of major amputation was 2.6%. The risk of major amputation was 48% lower in CS (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31, 0.90). Other risk factors for major amputation were congestive heart failure (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.12, 2.87), depression (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.18, 2.99), diabetes with complications (OR 4.75, 95% CI 1.92, 15.85), peripheral artery disease (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.03, 3.38) and gangrene (OR 9.0, 95% CI 5.61, 14.78). Although the risks of hospitalization for foot infection within 12 months after diagnosis of DFU were 24% lower (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67, 0.85), the risk of minor amputation was 58% higher for CS (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.22, 2.07).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Medicaid coverage of podiatry was protective against hospitalization for infection and major amputation in patients with new onset DFU. A corresponding increase in minor amputation may be related to early identification and treatment.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is a highly morbid disease that often is a contraindication to transplantation in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Understanding risk factors for CLTI in the ESRD population is crucial to successful treatment and transplant eligibility. We have recently identified increasing community social vulnerability to be a significant risk factor associated with CLTI and ESRD in the general population. To date, however, no study has examined this relationship among the ESRD population and whether race influences this relationship.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Cross sectional analysis of 2016 data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) was used to identify ESRD patients with and without CLTI using ICD-9 codes. Community level social vulnerability was characterized using the social vulnerability index (SVI), a composite measure that includes socioeconomic status, household composition &amp; disability, minority status &amp; language, and housing type &amp; transportation. A higher SVI signifies a more vulnerable community, whereas a lower SVI signifies a less vulnerable community. SVI was then linked to USRDS data at the patient home zip code level. To determine the association of community level SVI and race with CLTI among ESRD patients, a logistic regression model was generated adjusting for clinically relevant variables including age, sex, race, and cardiovascular comorbidities.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 779,504 ESRD patients were examined within the USRDS; 750,853 patients without CLTI and 28,651 patients with CLTI were identified. In univariate analysis, increased SVI, or more vulnerable community, and Black race were significantly associated with increased odds of having CLTI (SVI OR 1.06, 95% CI [1.05-1.06], p&lt;.001; Black race OR 1.19, 95% CI [1.16-1.22], p&lt;.001). After adjusting for baseline characteristics and comorbidities, SVI was not associated with increased odds of CLTI, while Black race (OR 1.25, 95% CI [1.22-1.28], p&lt;.001), male gender (OR 1.27, 95% CI [1.24-1.30], p&lt;.001), congestive heart failure (OR 1.33, 95% CI [1.29-1.36], p&lt;.001) and diabetes (OR 2.33, 95% CI [2.26-2.39], p&lt;.001) were independently associated with CLTI. Prior renal transplant (OR 0.59, 95% CI [0.56-0.61], p&lt;.001) was inversely associated with CLTI (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Among patients with ESRD, Black race, but not community level SVI, was independently associated with CLTI. Importantly, having a previous renal transplant was associated with a statistically significant reduction in CLTI. Further research into barriers for patients with CLTI to receive timely and successful CLTI treatment regardless of race is needed to increase patient access to transplant.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is difficult to treat and carries a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Although certain patient comorbidities have been associated with higher rates of CLTI, the association with a patient&rsquo;s community level social vulnerability index (SVI), a measure of geographic vulnerability examining social conditions such as poverty level, vehicle access, and housing type, has not been described. We hypothesized that a higher SVI, or more vulnerable community, will be associated with increased odds of having both ESRD and CLTI in the United States (U.S.).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Cross sectional analysis of 2016 data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) was used to identify individuals with both ESRD and CLTI and their geographic residence by zip code. CLTI was defined using ICD-9 codes within the USRDS and the median zip code SVI was calculated using the 2016 Centers for Disease Control SVI dataset and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development&rsquo;s U.S. Postal Service Zip Code to Census Tract Crosswalk File. This zip code level SVI was then linked to patients with CLTI in the USRDS and population estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS). Using ESRD patients who had a CLTI diagnosis in 2016, univariate logistic regression was performed to describe the association between community level SVI and having both ESRD and CLTI in the U.S. population. Regression utilized an events&ndash;trials format with CLTI positive ESRD patients as events and ACS estimated population age 18-80 as trials.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In 2016, there were a total of 29,597 patients in the USRDS with CLTI. In the same year, within the ACS dataset there were 238,822,063 people aged18-80 in the estimated general population. Nationally, mean SVI score for the total 18-80 population was 0.48 and mean SVI score for patients with CLTI and ESRD was 0.58. Regression analysis demonstrated for every 0.25 higher SVI, or more vulnerable the community, the odds of CLTI and ESRD were 1.52 times higher (p &lt; .001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Higher community level SVI is associated with increased odds of having both ESRD and CLTI in the U.S.. These findings indicate geographic vulnerability is associated with increased risk of ESRD and CLTI. Future examination of the relationship between SVI, race, and known CLTI risk factors with CLTI in the ESRD population is needed to determine if there are unique characteristics of CLTI associated with an increase in SVI or if it is ESRD that is driving this relationship.

Despite evidence that poor operative ergonomics leads to muscle fatigue, injury, and burnout, formal ergonomics education has not been widely implemented in surgical residency. Data on resident ergonomics knowledge and musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms is limited. Our study aims to examine the prevalence of MSK symptoms and baseline ergonomics knowledge in general surgery residents and assess the impact of an ergonomics improvement intervention. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We distributed an anonymous voluntary survey to all general surgery residents at a single academic residency, assessing resident characteristics, MSK symptoms, and ergonomics knowledge. Following this baseline survey, we implemented an ergonomics improvement intervention consisting of a lecture and a personalized posture coaching session by trained physiatrists. Six months following the intervention, an anonymous voluntary post-intervention survey was distributed assessing resident characteristics, changes in MSK symptoms, and new ergonomic practices. Results were analyzed using Chi-squared and pairwise Z tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

33/35 (94%) residents responsed to the baseline survey. 100% reported some degree of MSK pain with neck (79%), back (76%) and shoulder (61%) being most affected. Prevalence of muscle stiffness and fatigue decreased with increasing height. Senior residents were more likely to report back pain compared to junior residents (100% vs 66%, p=0.04). Female residents reported higher frequencies of MSK pain (p=0.01) and more muscle fatigue than males (100% vs 73.3%, p=0.03). All residents reported little to no ergonomics knowledge with 68% reporting that ergonomics was rarely discussed in the operating room (OR), and 86% reporting that applying ergonomic principles would contribute to their well-being. The post-intervention survey received 26 (74.2%) responses. 100% reported that the intervention was an effective method of ergonomics education. Post-intervention, residents reported implementing microbreaks, MSK exercises, and better table/room personalization. MSK symptom severity improved in 81.8% of residents and 72.7% reported that applying ergonomic principles contributed to their overall well-being. Reports that ergonomics was rarely discussed in the OR significantly decreased to 22.8% of residents following the intervention (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Surgical resident knowledge of ergonomics is poor and MSK symptoms are common. Resident gender, seniority, and height are associated with different MSK symptoms. Didactic teaching and personalized posture coaching can be effective in improving knowledge of ergonomic practices and reducing MSK symptom severity. Surgical residencies should consider implementing similar interventions to improve resident well-being.

Meyerson<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Kentucky, Department Of Surgery, Lexington, KY, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Kentucky, College Of Health Sciences, Lexington, KY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Musculoskeletal pain and discomfort in surgeons due to operating is reported in upwards of 79-87% of experienced surgeons in many specialties. While these reports are alarming, affecting both surgeon well-being and career longevity, little is known about when or how these issues begin to become clinically significant during a surgeon&rsquo;s career. This survey evaluates the prevalence and impact of musculoskeletal pain among surgical residents.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: After IRB approval, an anonymous 19-question survey based on Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was sent via email to all surgical residents at one institution. Surgical specialties included cardiothoracic, general surgery, neurosurgery, obstetrics and gynecology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, and plastic surgery. Residents were asked about pain in neck, shoulder, upper back, lower back, and elbow/wrist. A total of 141 survey links were distributed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Fifty-three residents responded from 8 different specialties (38% response rate). The majority of respondents were male (53%) with a mean age of 30 &plusmn; 2 years. Residents in all specialties and all years of clinical training responded, with the greatest number from the second year of clinical training (30%) and the general surgery program (48%). An overwhelming 96% of residents reported experiencing pain they felt was due to operating. The most common sites of pain were the neck and upper back with 83% of residents reporting neck pain and 70% reporting upper back pain within the last week. This pain was a chronic issue for most with similar numbers of residents reporting pain in the last month and the last year. Nearly half of residents reported that pain slightly to substantially interfered with their ability to work (44%) and with activities outside of work (46%). The majority of residents (75%) sought no treatment. Those seeking treatment utilized professional massage (15%) and physical therapy (4%). One quarter of residents reported stretching before or after surgery and two thirds performed some form of exercise outside of work at least once a week. No residents missed work despite reporting pain. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Many residents among a variety of surgical specialties experience frequent pain while operating. Even if all non-responders to this survey were pain free that still leaves over a third of residents with work-related musculoskeletal pain issues. Pain affects residents&rsquo; function inside and outside of work responsibilities, and some have begun to seek treatment. As a specialty, we need to focus on early intervention strategies to prevent surgeons&rsquo; pain from impacting patient care, surgeon wellness, and career longevity.

Busch<sup>2</sup>, J. D'Angelo<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Physician burnout has been demonstrated at high rates among surgical faculty and residents, with 60-70% of surgeons reporting burnout symptoms. Research has shown that burnout affects physicians both personally and professionally, as physicians experiencing burnout have higher rates of depression and substance abuse as well as higher rates of attrition, medical errors, and worsened clinical performance. Surgical culture often promotes self-reliance and rugged individualism, however lacking social connections may worsen burnout within surgical faculty and trainees. Therefore, we aim to determine if a lack of professional or personal community is associated with higher burnout levels in surgical faculty and residents.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a cross-sectional, electronic survey of surgical residents and faculty at seven institutions in the United States. Variables measured included mentorship experience (struggling to identify a mentor), presence of a social community outside of work, burnout levels (measured by the Professional Fulfillment Index [PFI] &ndash; 15-high fulfillment, 75-low fulfillment), hours worked on average over the previous 2 months, and demographics (race, gender, and role &ndash; faculty or resident).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 218 participants completed the survey (50% resident physicians, 54% male). As a whole, participants generally scored high on the PFI, indicating poor professional fulfillment (M=36.29, SD=11.80). Slightly more than half of participants reported participating in at least one social community exterior to their hospital (59%) and slightly less than half reported that they struggled to find a mentor at their institution (43%). Multiple Linear Regression revealed that struggling to find a mentor (b=0.2, p=0.003) and not having at least one social community exterior to the hospital (b=0.24, p&lt;0.001) were independently associated with significantly higher PFI scores (F(6, 211) = 5.15, p &lt;.001, R<sup>2</sup> = .128). Gender, race, role (faculty or resident), and hours worked on average in the last two months were not associated with PFI score.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Struggling to find a mentor and a lack of social community outside of work are associated with higher levels of burnout in this multi-institutional study of surgical faculty and residents. These findings suggest that targeting improved support for building professional and personal relationships may be a strategy for improving burnout levels in both faculty and resident surgeons.

Medical students are expected to be able to perform basic suturing upon graduation. However, technical skills training for suturing is not frequently incorporated into the preclinical medical school curriculum. A proposed concept to increase exposure to suturing is to integrate art into practice by mixing cross-stitching with suturing. We hypothesize that preclinical students trained with this &ldquo;cross-suturing&rdquo; method demonstrate improved subjective and objective suturing performance.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Students in their pre-clinical years were voluntarily recruited to participate in this randomized controlled study. Students were randomly assigned to the control versus cross-stitch intervention group. Both groups were provided with a basic suturing video they could review prior to the session. The intervention group participated in an art class where they were able to practice cross-suturing while the control group was sent home with suturing supplies. Measurements were conducted pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at a 2-week follow up. Their skills were measured through a mixed methods study approach. Their subjective score was graded on a Likert scale ranging from 1-4 measuring proficiency, confidence, and anxiety levels for a total of 12 points. Their objective score was measured through a deidentified video recording 5 simple interrupted sutures on a pig&rsquo;s foot and were graded by two blinded expert raters using the American College of Surgeons (ACS) basic suturing and knot tying performance rating tool and Global Rating Scale (GRS) for a total of 30 points. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t-tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 16 pre-clinical medical students participated. Likert and ACS scores were comparable in the pre-intervention measurements (Likert: Control 5.6&plusmn;1.5 vs. Intervention 5.9&plusmn;1.1, p=0.713; ACS: Control 15.4&plusmn;1.9 vs. Intervention 18.0&plusmn;3.5, p=0.0947). The intervention group showed significant improvement relative to the control group at the post-intervention measurements (Likert: Control 6.6&plusmn;1.1 vs. Intervention 8.8&plusmn;0.9, p=0.0007) and (ACS: Control 16.5&plusmn;2.1 vs. Intervention 24.6&plusmn;3.2, p=0.0001). The intervention group showed retained skills at the 2-week follow up (Likert: Intervention Post 8.8&plusmn;0.9 vs. Intervention 2-week 8.5&plusmn;0.8, p=0.6027) and (ACS: Intervention Post 24.6&plusmn;3.2 vs. Intervention 2-week 25.2&plusmn;2.1, p=0.7276).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The cross-suturing approach has proven to be an effective method to improve suturing skills amongst pre-clinical medical students. This low cost and engaging approach to medical student surgical education should be explored with more medical students to better prepare them for their clinical years.

Female faculty representation in academic surgery remains poor, creating obstacles in developing a robust surgical workforce. We sought to examine the extent of gender disparity in academic rank and leadership among academic surgical faculty, and explore whether experience, training, and research productivity accounts for these observed differences.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data was collected on faculty from 16 of the largest GS residency programs in the US, with 4 from each US Census-Bureau region. We included those practicing in a subspecialty that a GS resident could pursue for fellowship. Information was limited to what was publicly available on hospital websites, research profiles, and Scopus. Data on gender, academic rank, leadership titles, year of medical school graduation (as a proxy for experience), fellowship training, and research productivity (number of publications and h-index) was collected. Academic advancement (rank higher than assistant professor) and leadership roles (chair, vice chair, division chief, or residency program director) were examined by gender.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 1,467 faculty members studied, 26.5% were women. Fewer women achieved academic advancement (40.7% vs 62.3%, p&lt;0.0001) or held leadership titles (14.7% vs 23.1%, p=0.0005). Female representation increased steadily over time; women made up 12% of graduates prior to 1989 (late-career), 18% of graduates in 1990-1999 (mid-career), and 38% of graduates in 2000 or later (early-career). To account for this, outcomes were stratified by career stage. In stratified analysis, we observed no gender difference for academic advancement or leadership roles in the late and mid-career cohorts. Within the early-career cohort, women were less likely to have advanced academically (23.8% vs 33.4%, p=0.0062). They were also less likely to have &ge;30 publications (ge30pubs; 23% vs 41%, p&lt;0.0001) despite similar rates of fellowship training. Faculty with ge30pubs were more likely to have advanced academically (58% vs 15.2%, p&lt;0.0001), and have leadership roles (26.1% vs 5.3%, p&lt;0.0001). Male faculty had 2.2 greater odds (95%CI 1.6-3.1) and fellowship trained surgeons had 1.7 greater odds (95%CI 1.05-2.97) of having ge30pubs, suggesting that research productivity is driven by gender and fellowship training. Hence, while academic advancement and having leadership roles were not directly driven by gender, they were indirectly driven by gender due to the impact of research productivity on achieving these outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although female representation in academic surgery is improving, those early in their career suffer significant gender disparities in achieving academic advancement and leadership roles, both of which are closely linked to research productivity. The next steps in efforts for gender equality should further investigate why women are not publishing at the same rate as their male peers.

Rappold<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Maine Medical Center, Department Of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Portland, MAINE, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Maine Medical Center, Department Of Surgery, Portland, MAINE, USA&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>Maine Medical Center, Department Of Pathology And Laboratory Medicine, Portland, MAINE, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Thromboelastography (TEG) is a method for quantitatively measuring the ability of whole blood to form a clot. TEG differs from standard coagulation panels because it is a viscoelastic assay that uses whole blood to assess clot formation and dynamics by applying a rotational force continuously creating torsion on a wire resulting in a pattern that can be interpreted to reflect the different phases of clot formation. Due to the nature of TEG, the test can provide information about platelet and clotting factor functionality whereas conventional coagulation panels cannot. The goal of this case series was to determine how often the TEG and conventional coagulation tests agree by comparing TEG with a coagulation panel consisting of international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and platelet count in a small series of patients in a rural academic medical center that is resource constrained with regards to blood product availability. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective analysis of 16 consecutive patients who underwent standard thromboelastography was conducted as well as an analysis of those patients who underwent TEG platelet mapping (TEGPM). Studies were performed in a clinical laboratory using the TEG 5000&reg; by trained medical technologists under conditions and procedures recommended by the manufacturer.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Patients with paired TEG and conventional coagulation panels were included in this study, excluding data points from patients where the coagulation panel was not determined in the same time period. The following values were compared: R with INR and aPTT; MA with platelet count; and alpha angle and K with fibrinogen. Overall, the paired results correlated 53.5% of the time, with the highest agreement being with the alpha angle and fibrinogen that correlated 100% of the time. The pairing that had the least correlation was the R-value and INR that correlated 10% of the time. Regarding platelet mapping, TEGPM was inconsistent with the patients&rsquo; medication regimen 78% of the time

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this small case series TEG parameters and conventional coagulation panel results were often inconsistent, and TEGPM does not appear to be in agreement with the patients&rsquo; medication regimen. In spite of previous supportive literature of TEG, this analysis sheds uncertainty on the accuracy of TEG and suggests that its value may lie in using it in conjunction with conventional coagulation studies and the patients&rsquo; clinical situation. For resource constrained facilities the use of TEG to drive coagulopathy correction may result in the unnecessary use of precious blood products.

Hunter<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>OUHSC, Oklahoma City, OKLAHOMA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>OUHSC, Pediatric Surgery, Oklahoma City, OK, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Growing evidence supports that maternal obesity plays a role in shaping neonatal health. It is inferred that certain dietary trends lead to susceptibility to gastrointestinal disease. Maternal diets rich in saturated fats and sugars (Western) have been implicated in changes to neonatal gut immunity and microbiome. We studied the influence of a maternal Western diet on offspring gut in the Olive baboon. It was hypothesized that a maternal Western diet would lead to changes in offspring suggestive of inflammation and compromised gut barrier integrity, thus predisposing to disease and infection.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Ileal samples were collected from a larger, IACUC-approved institutional study investigating the influence of maternal diet on offspring. Adult, nulliparous female baboons (ages 4-10 years) were fed two diets, a Western diet rich in saturated fats and fructose (WSD, n=5) and a Control diet of typical monkey chow (n=5). Both were matched in fiber and micronutrient content. Three months after diet initiation, baboons were bred. Cesarean sections were completed at 165 &plusmn;5 days (0.9 gestation of typical baboon), and the offspring were euthanized for necropsy and tissue collection. Mother&rsquo;s acquired level of adiposity was measured with sums of skin fold thickness and CRP levels were obtained. Genes implicated in neonatal inflammation and gut barrier integrity, including IL-8, IL-1&beta;, occludin, and claudin-2, were quantified via PCR. Statistical analysis was carried out with Student&rsquo;s t-test, p-value &lt;0.05 significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There was no difference between maternal adiposity or body weight at time of cesarean. Maternal CRP was significantly elevated in WSD group (p=0.009). Although no significant differences were identified, there was a trend towards increased gut expression of IL-8 and IL-1&beta; in neonates of WSD-fed mothers. Furthermore, occludin trended down for the same group (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The influence of maternal obesity on neonatal health is well established. The role of diet itself has been difficult to evaluate in the absence of obesity. This study aimed to determine if a maternal diet high in fat and sugars would lead to signature changes in the neonatal gut. In our study, the exposure time of WSD was insufficient to induce significant fat deposition in mothers but did increase maternal CRP. Our results suggest that WSD alone did have a trend towards increased gut inflammation in the offspring. Increased study numbers are needed to determine significance. Given maternal obesity is an independent risk factor for preterm labor, long-term analysis will lead to a better understanding of the effect of maternal diet and obesity on neonatal gastrointestinal health.

Human intestinal organoid (HIO)-derived tissue engineered intestine is a potential cure for IF. Research to date has demonstrated successful HIO transplant (tHIO) into mice with significant in vivo maturation;. however, a current gap in knowledge is the exploration of murine host sex as a biological variable (SABV) in tHIO function. It is established that tHIOs are responsive to circulating factors from the murine host. Furthermore, sex hormones, such as estrogen, have been described to influence intestinal stem cells during homeostasis and regeneration, as well as intestinal functions such as barrier maintenance and motility. We aimed to investigate the potential role of murine host SABV in tHIO function in vivo; specifically, intestinal epithelial barrier maintenance and muscle contractility.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: HIOs were derived from hESCs in vitro and transplanted into NSG male and female mice. tHIOs were harvested after 8-12 weeks of in vivo growth for analysis. RT-qPCR was conducted to evaluate select tight junction genes (claudin 3 (CLDN3), claudin 7 (CLDN7), claudin 15 (CLDN15), occludin (OCLN), and tight junction protein-1/zonula occludens-1 (TJP1/ZO-1)) as well as mesenchymal genes (smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and vimentin (VIM)). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for select tight junction proteins and mesenchymal markers. An Ussing chamber was used to measure transepithelial resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran (4kDa) permeability. A contractility apparatus was used to measure total contractile activity (TCA), amplitude, contraction frequency, and tension in tHIOs from male and female mice ex vivo.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The expression of select tight junction genes and mesenchymal genes from tHIOs in male and female murine hosts is not significantly different (Fig 1A&amp;E). The morphology and protein expression on IHC are similar as well (Fig 1B,C,F,G). Epithelial barrier function as measured by TER 29.8 vs 23.5 &Omega; *cm2, p=0.40 (Fig 1D) and FITC-dextran permeability at 1-hour 8108 vs 6314 ng/mL/cm2, p=0.73 is not different in tHIOs from male (n=4) and female (n=5) hosts, respectively. Contractility as measured by TCA 346 vs 471 g*s/cm2, p=0.50 (Fig 1H), amplitude 0.97 vs 0.78 g/cm2, p=0.66, contraction frequency 0.24 vs 0.17 contractions/s, p=0.33, and tension 22.3 vs 26.4 g/g tissue, p=0.76 is not significantly different in tHIOs from male (n=3) and female (n=3) hosts, respectively.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This data suggests that murine host sex is not a significant biological variable influencing function of the intestinal epithelial barrier and muscle contractility of tHIOs.

Pierre<sup>2, 3</sup>, A.

Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is a life-threatening complication that affects up to 60% of patients with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). The etiology of HAEC is complex and multifactorial. Secretory IgA (sIgA) is the primary effector molecule of mucosal immune defense and binds bacteria in the lumen. Transcytosis of sIgA into the intestinal lumen is mediated by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). pIgR expression is regulated by interleukin-25 (IL-25). We have previously shown that levels of IL-25, pIgR and sIgA are decreased prior to the onset of HAEC and that IgA accumulates in the lamina propria because of failure of transport into the lumen. We therefore postulate that targeting pIgR transport could be a potential therapeutic option in the treatment or prevention of HAEC. The purpose of this study was to determine if exogenous interleukin-25 (IL-25) increases expression of pIgR.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Ileal segments isolated from wild-type (WT) mice were placed into our Ex Vivo Intestinal Segment Culture (EVISC) system and treated with recombinant IL-25 using a range of doses (50-100 ng/mL) and times (30-60 minutes) [n=3-5 animals per condition]. pIgR mRNA expression was determined by RT-qPCR. pIgR protein expression was determined by Western Blot analysis. Results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by appropriate post-hoc testing and p&lt;0.05 considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
qPCR analysis revealed that pIgR mRNA expression did not increase with either dose at 30 minutes of exposure. However, pIgR message was increased 2.95-fold vs. control when ileal segments were treated with 100 ng/mL IL-25 for 60 minutes (p&lt;0.05) [Figure]. pIgR protein expression was unchanged vs. controls with the lower dose (50 ng/mL) of IL-25 at both times points. However, pIgR protein expression was increased by 1.57-fold and 1.89-fold vs. controls when treated with 100 ng/mL IL-25 for 30 mins and 60 mins, respectively.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our results indicate that IL-25 increases expression of pIgR in ileum of WT mice. Of the various conditions tested, increase in pIgR expression was profound when intestinal segments were treated ex vivo with IL-25 for 60 mins at 100 ng/mL. Next steps include extending our studies to include intestinal segments from Hirschsprung mouse models and Hirschsprung patient-derived enteroids. Using IL-25 to increase pIgR expression and subsequent IgA transport holds promise as a targeted treatment or prevention strategy in HAEC.

Hutchins<sup>1</sup>, M. H. Erwin<sup>1</sup>, J. E. Stewart<sup>1</sup>, E. A. Beierle<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Division Of Pediatric Surgery, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric solid tumor outside the brain and children with high-risk disease continue to have survival rates less than 50%. A major caveat of neuroblastoma therapy is to induce tumor cell differentiation with the objective of making the tumor less likely to relapse. This strategy is based on the knowledge that some neuroblastomas will spontaneously mature into benign entities. We previously performed a kinome analysis revealing the upregulation of PIM kinases in aggressive, non-differentiated neuroblastoma tumor cells, implying that PIM kinases play a role in maintaining the aggressive neuroblastoma phenotype. Investigators have examined the role of PIM kinases in pediatric hematologic malignancies as well as solid tumors including hepatoblastoma, and noted that PIM inhibition decreased tumor cell growth. There are limited data addressing the role of PIM kinases in neuroblastoma. Thus, we hypothesize that inhibition of PIM kinases would decrease tumorgenicity in neuroblastoma.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: SK-N-AS and SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma cell lines were utilized. PIM inhibition was accomplished using the small molecule, AZD1208, a pan-PIM kinase inhibitor. Cells were plated and treated for 72 hours with AZD1208 (0, 30 &micro;M), concentrations below the LD<sub>50</sub> dose (40 &micro;M). Cell differentiation was examined utilizing quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) with probes specific for known neuroblastoma differentiation markers including CDKN3, Tubb3, Eno2, HoxC9, and GAP43. Neurite outgrowth, another indicator of neuroblastoma differentiation, was measured following 72 hour treatment with AZD1208 (0, 30 &micro;M). Neurite outgrowth was quantified as a ratio of neurite length to cell body width. Data were reported as mean &plusmn; SEM, compared with two tailed Student&rsquo;s t-test, and p&le;0.05 considered significant.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The abundance of mRNA for markers of neuroblastoma differentiation was increased following PIM inhibition. GAP43 mRNA was significantly increased in the SK-N-AS and SK-N-BE(2) cell lines. In the SK-N-AS cell line, there was also an increase in CDKN3, Tubb3, Eno2, and HoxC9 mRNA abundance. At the phenotypic level, AZD1208 treatment resulted in a significant increase in neurite outgrowth in SK-N-AS (2.6 &plusmn; 0.2 vs. 3.8 &plusmn; 0.05, 0 vs. 30 &micro;M, p&lt;0.05) and SK-N-BE(2) (2.45 &plusmn; 0.5 vs. 5.5 &plusmn; 0.2, 0 vs. 30 &micro;M, p&lt;0.05) cells; providing further evidence of differentiation. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Inhibition of PIM kinases with the pan-PIM inhibitor, AZD1208, promoted differentiation in neuroblastoma cell lines as shown by increased abundance of mRNA for GAP43, CDKN3, Tubb3, Eno2, and HoxC9 and increased neurite outgrowth. These findings support the necessity for further exploration of the role of PIM kinases in neuroblastoma.

Hunter<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Oklahoma College Of Medicine, Department Of Surgery, Oklahoma City, OK, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of the premature infant and is the leading cause of mortality due to gastrointestinal illness in this population. Mortality rates can range up to 70% in neonates diagnosed with NEC. The pathophysiology of NEC remains unknown, but several studies have correlated the disease process to a disruption in the gut microbiome, intestinal prematurity, and dysregulation of cellular processes such as tight junction maintenance, cell signaling, and cytokine production. Caveolin-1 is a small membrane protein that is found ubiquitously across several cell types and is a primary contributor in signal transduction and vesicular trafficking. There has been a paucity of data regarding the role of cavelolin-1 in the pathogenesis of NEC. We hypothesize that this important cell signaling regulator, caveloin-1, plays an integral role in infant susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Human intestinal tissue was obtained from three different groups of patients undergoing bowel resections. The first group of patients were control infants of corrected gestational age of 30 weeks to 54 weeks without a history of NEC. The second group consisted of neonates (ages 12 days to 2 months) with a history of medical NEC and no surgical indication. Lastly, tissue was collected from infants (ages 5 days of life to 3 weeks) with active NEC and surgical intervention. Mucosal scrapings were collected from each to obtain intestinal epitheliual tissue and western blot analysis was performed on each. Phosphorylated (or activated) caveolin-1 expression was used as the target of western blot analysis.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Intestinal specimen from patients with NEC expressed a significantly higher amount of phosphorylated caveolin-1 when compared to controls (p=0.01). There was also a slightly increased concentration of caveolin-1 in the active NEC group when compared to patients with a history of NEC. This data illustrates that patients with a diagnosis of NEC (either current or historical) have an increased amount of caveolin-1 expression at baseline when compared to infants without the disease.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Neonates with either active NEC or a history of NEC have significantly increased expression of caveolin-1 when compared to controls. This data suggests that phosphorylated caveolin-1 expression may be a molecular factor that leads to a premature susceptibility to NEC. This poses a potential target for therapy against caveolin-1 in the intestinal epithelium as a treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis.

DeBakey Department Of Surgery, Houston, TX, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Texas Children's Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Mid-gestational dermal fetal wounds heal regeneratively without scarring, until the size of the wound reaches a critical defect that results in fibrosis. The capacity of regenerative healing is due in large part to fetal fibroblast (FFB) production of a pericellular matrix (PCM) which is abundant in high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA), a glycosaminoglycan which has been shown to promote regenerative healing across several organ systems. Others have demonstrated that fetal skin has negligible resting tension when compared to adult skin. We hypothesize that large fetal wounds generate higher mechanical tension that promotes a phenotypic change in FFB towards the pro-fibrotic adult fibroblast (AFB).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
FFB and AFB were isolated from E14.5 and 8wk adult C57BL/6J mice, respectively, then subjected to 10% tonic strain for 3, 6, 12, or 24 hours using a mechanical strain device. The pericellular matrix area surrounding cells was measured using a particle exclusion assay. Expression of hyaluronan synthesis and degradation genes was measured using RT-qPCR. Fibrotic phenotype was evaluated using RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR fibrosis array. Functional migration was measured following tension treatment using a scratch wound assay which was performed following 24 hours of tension or static conditions. Statistics were performed using ANOVA or student&rsquo;s T-test where appropriate, a p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
FFB PCM decreased in response to 24 hours of tension (2.78&plusmn;0.14 vs 1.98&plusmn;0.15 PCM/cell area, p&lt;0.01) to a size similar to static AFB (1.84&plusmn;0.08 PCM/cell area, p&gt;0.05) (Figure 1). Following 12 hours of tension, FFB expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 decreased 4-fold compared to static (p&lt;0.01) and expression of the hyaluronidase KIAA1199 increased 8-fold compared to static (p&lt;0.001), indicating tension promoted a shift towards HA degradation. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis of genes evaluated in the PCR fibrosis array demonstrates a shift in the fibrotic phenotype of FFB towards AFB following 6 hours of tension. In the scratch wound assay, FFB subjected to tension demonstrated a decreased wound closure rate compared to static control at 84 hours (71.3&plusmn;8.8% vs 89&plusmn;4.9% closure, p&lt;0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Mechanical tension shifts the regenerative, HMW-HA-producing phenotype of fetal fibroblasts towards and adult-like pro-fibrotic phenotype, which may explain why scarring is seen in larger midgestational fetal wounds. This work adds to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the fetal regenerative phenotype and will further the goal of developing anti-scarring therapeutics.

The main source of morbidity and mortality in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension (PH) mediated by endothelial dysfunction, fibrosis, and mesenchymal differentiation. Preliminary data suggests that males have a predisposition toward CDH-PH; however, there are no human models to study the pathogenesis of CDH. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) have been used in other disease models to represent disease-based vascular changes. We hypothesize that HUVECs from CDH patients will display pathologic features of PH found in CDH and will help decipher the role of sex as a biological variable.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

HUVECs were harvested from umbilical cords of 10 CDH patients (7 male, 3 female) and 5 human age- and sex-matched controls (3 male, 2 female). CDH HUVECs and control HUVECs were treated with recombinant TGF-&beta;1 for 48 hours. Expression of &alpha; -SMA and Col-1a1 was measured using RT-qPCR. RNA sequencing was performed to determine the differential regulation of genes and biological pathways between CDH HUVECs and HUVEC controls and HUVECs of different sexes. These data were then compared to a published CDH lung organoid database. Continuous data were analyzed with paired t-tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Following TGF-&szlig;1 treatment, CDH HUVECs demonstrated higher expression of &alpha;-SMA (4.9 &plusmn; 1.1 vs. 0.9 &plusmn; 0.1, p&lt;0.05) and Col-1a1 (6.1 &plusmn; 1.0 vs. 0.8 &plusmn; 0.2 , p &lt;0.01) than controls. RNA sequencing on CDH HUVECs and CDH lung organoids highlighted overlapping pathways consistent with endothelial dysfunction, fibrosis, and mesenchymal development and differentiation (Figure 1A). Male and female CDH HUVECs shared only 5 of 166 upregulated and 2 of 251 downregulated genes (Figure 1B).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
CDH HUVECs demonstrated sex-based gene expression differences, which may suggest an underlying cause for the sex discrepancy in CDH-PH. Our data confirm that CDH HUVECs demonstrate gene expression and pathway regulation changes consistent with other known models of CDH. Furthermore, males show upregulation of the ECM organization and mesenchymal cell development pathways that may explain the elevated incidence of CDH-PH in males versus females. These findings have the potential to alter the way we manage sex-specific differences in CDH-PH.

Martin<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Maternal stress is a well-established risk factor for preterm birth and is associated with adverse neonatal birth outcomes such as increased susceptibility to inflammatory diseases and long-lasting immunological changes. During pregnancy, major adaptations occur in the maternal immune system to protect the mother and her future baby. However, little is known about how stress during gestation affects these immunological adaptations in the mother and baby. A recent study in mice revealed that prenatal maternal stress-induced a systematic reduction in T cells, B cells, Tregs, and IL-4 and IL-17A-producing cells in the offspring indicating that gestational stress affects adaptive immunity. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In this study, we used a murine model of prenatal stress and evaluated the changes in serum immunoglobulin levels in the dams and offspring following gestational stress. Because IL-4 and IL-17 are cytokines involved in class-switching, we hypothesized that a reduction in the levels of IL-4 and IL-17 producing cells following prenatal stress would modulate the levels of IgG subclasses. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Consistent with our hypothesis, we found a significant decrease in the levels of IgG2b and IgG3 in the dams following stress. In contrast, we observed an increase in the levels of IgG1 and IgG2b in the offspring derived from stressed dams compared to unstressed controls. We made similar observations in pregnant mice and offspring that were fed corticosterone in drinking water during gestation indicating that these changes in Ig levels are mediated by excess cortisol. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Further studies are underway to characterize the humoral immune response in stressed offspring to a T-cell dependent and T-cell independent antigen. Overall, the results from these studies will help better understand the causal link between prenatal maternal stress and compromised neonatal immunity and will help develop optimal vaccination strategies to protect both pregnant women and infants.

MG53 is an endogenous protein with cell membrane repair properties and ability to modulate the inflammasome. We hypothesize that absence of MG53 levels of recipient MG53 increases the warm IRI and higher levels of MG53 mitigates the IRI associated with lung transplantation.

Materials: To demonstrate protection, wild type (wt) lung donor allografts were transplanted into either wt background, a MG53 knockout (mg53-/-) or a constitutively over-expressed MG53 (tPA-MG53) mouse recipient after 1 hour of warm ischemic injury. The mice were survived for 5 days after transplantation. Bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) and tissue was collected at sacrifice. BAL and tissue underwent analysis for markers of apoptosis and a biometric signature of lung health. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The absence MG53 (mg53-/-) resulted significantly in higher levels of markers of overall cell lysis (LDH) and endothelial cell injury (Big ET-1). Over-expression of MG53 resulted in a signature similar to wt controls. At the time of explant, tPA-MG53 recipient donor tissue expressed significantly higher levels of MG53, as measured by immunohistochemistry, as compared to mg53-/- demonstrating uptake of the endogenous over-expressed MG53 into the donor tissue. Differences in apoptosis (TUNEL) were assessed.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: In a warm ischemic injury model of lung transplantation, absence of MG53 results in higher cell injury and inflammation. Endogenous over-expression of MG53 in the recipient results in protection in the wt donor. Together, these data suggest that MG53 is a potential therapeutic agent for use in lung transplant to mitigate IRI.

Here we present preliminary data on a new small molecule (sm) inhibitor of IL-18 we have identified in our laboratory from an in silico search of over 700,000 compounds.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
In silico identification was followed by testing the purity, and cytoxicity (in vascular cells) of sm inhibitor compounds. Seven compounds with highest potential of inhibiting IL-18 were identified. In the present study, the IC<sub>50</sub> value of one of these sm inhibitors was determined. Upon treatment with IL-18, the expression of IFN-g gene and protein expression are increased in Natural Killer (NK) cells and hence NK cells were used to establish the in vitro sm inhibitor potency. NK cells were serum-starved for 4 hours, allowed to incubate with increasing concentrations (10nM, 100nM, 1mM, and 10 mM) of the sm inhibitor for 2 hours and then treated with 50ng/mL of IL-18. After 24 hours, the cells were harvested and IFN-g gene expression was measured with qRT-PCR.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
IL-18 treatment resulted in 2.27 fold increase in IFN-g gene expression while 10nM, 100nM, 1mM, and 10 mM inhibitor concentrations resulted in a 0.8283, 0.7280, 0.5961 and 0.5201 fold decrease respectively in IFN-g gene expression. The IC<sub>50 </sub>value for this compound was determined to be 12.36 mM.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
NK cell IFN-g gene expression showed a significant (P&lt;0.05) dose-dependent decrease with increasing concentrations of the new small molecule inhibitor of IL-18. Further in vivo studies will be implemented to determine the compounds potential in decreasing the development of intimal hyperplasia.

We have previously established non-cationic, cell-penetrating liposomal nanoparticles (R8-PLP) for effective gene therapy in vascular cell types. We also previously established PEGylated liposomal nanoparticles functionalized with collagen targeting peptides (CTP-PLP) that preferentially bind collagen IV, a major sub-endothelial matrix protein exposed in areas of vascular pathogenesis. We hypothesize that dual ligand-modified liposomes (R8-CTP-PLP), will exhibit multifunctional potential to enhance targeted delivery to diseased vascular tissue. Here we aim to design R8-CTP-PLPs using empirically defined liposomal formulations, and test their efficacy in targeting human vascular explants ex vivo.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Non-targeting liposomes were formed using bulk DOPC with 30mol% cholesterol + 10mol% DOPC-PEG + 0.1mol% Cy7-DOPE with or without 10mol% stearylated-R8 (PLP and R8-PLP, respectively). Collagen-targeting liposomes (CTP-PLP) were formed by reacting DSPE-PEG-DBCO to previously established collagen binding peptides (CBP), via copper-free click chemistry, and inserting 5mol% CBP-modified lipids to base PLPs at lipid hydration. Dual-ligand modified liposomes (R8-CTP-PLPs) were formed by the incorporation of CTP as described, concurrently with 10mol% sterylated-R8 motifs.

Saphenous vein and femoral artery segments were procured from amputated limbs and transported to the research laboratory to maintain tissue viability via bioreactor culture. Independent vessel explant segments were perfused for 30min with 50uM total lipid and fluorescently imaged via near-infrared (NIR) IVIS imaging. Binding was quantified as mean intensity of bound Cy7-labeled lipid per vessel area, normalized to background of non-perfused vessels.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
R8-CTP-PLPs demonstrated significantly enhanced binding to vessel explants compared to R8-PLP or CTP-PLP modification alone (Fig 1)

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
R8-CTP-PLP demonstrated increased binding affinity for human lower extremity vessels under simulated vascular flow. This dual-ligand strategy shows promise in the development of an efficacious delivery vehicle for targeted vascular therapeutics. Future studies aim to elucidate R8-CTP-PLP vessel binding and targeted gene silencing in an in vivo rodent model of vascular injury.

Reconstruction for PAD is limited by available autologous conduit. Unfortunately, prosthetic grafts to distal targets have poor patency secondary to thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia (IH). Current prosthetic grafts are stiff and have compliance mismatch compared with arteries which contributes to IH. Our previous data also indicate that compliant grafts with pulsatile behavior can shed platelets to reduce thrombosis. Our objective was to fabricate novel small caliber silicone vascular grafts with compliance properties and suture-ability similar to arteries. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Compliant prosthetic grafts were created by molding commercially available formulations of silicone rubber in 3D-printed casts with a 4mm mandrel. The grafts were tested for compliance under physiologic blood pressures, increasing air pressure, suture tear strength, and platelet adherence. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Compliant grafts were fabricated with different commercially available silicones and were visually and manually inspected. The graft fabricated with Smooth-On Dragon Skin 10 Slow had the most favorable gross characteristics and was tested for physical properties. This graft tolerated 2-hours on the pulsatile pump set to generate luminal pressures between 120/70 mmHg at 60 pulses per minute and distended 5-19% between these pressures. No aneurysms, graft lengthening or failures were observed. The graft reached maximum pressure at 208 mmHg after which it lengthened and distended but did not show aneurysmal degeneration or rupture. Graft suture strength was tested using 5-0 prolene suture. Suture tearing occurred at 220 grams of force as compared with pig carotid artery which showed tearing at 130 grams. Testing with thrombin activated platelets showed minimal platelet adherence in a pulsatile flow circuit. The silicone material did not stimulate significant platelet activation and accumulation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: By varying silicone properties of pot time, cure time, shore hardness, viscosity, and tensile strength, we fabricated a graft that matched arterial properties. The method of fabrication is easily reproducible and graft properties are easily tunable. This novel graft had excellent suture tear strength, was able to withstand physiologic pressures, easy to suture, and exhibited compliance similar to arteries. In preliminary platelet adherence studies, the silicone did not stimulate extensive platelet accumulation. This prototype silicone graft will be undergoing in vivo testing as an arterial interposition graft in a swine model.

Hypertrophic scar (HTS) formation is a common challenge that can impact patients&rsquo; quality of life and reintegration into society after a burn injury. In comparison to fibroblasts and keratinocytes, which are known contributors to HTS-symptomology, dermal microvascular endothelial cells (DMVECs) in HTS are less well-studied. Laser doppler imaging has shown an increased microcirculation and perfusion in HTS compared to surrounding normal skin (NS), and hypertension has been reported to be linked to increased HTS, suggesting a potential role of endothelial dysfunction in scar development. We hypothesize that transcript and protein-level responses in DMVECs from HTS differ from those in NS.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Full-thickness burns which formed HTSs were created in Duroc pigs (Figure 1B). HTSs and areas of NS were excised and digested in collagenase. Fibroblast-DMVEC co-cultures were saved in cryostorage. These cells lines from n=4 scars and n=1 NS were established and grown. Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1) lectin was used to sort for DMVECs by magnetic-activated cell sorting (Figure 1A). DMVECs were grown in 6-well plates (n=6 wells per scar/skin). Cells were lysed with Trizol reagent, and RNA was isolated. Conditioned-media was saved for protein analysis. RNA was used to create cDNA which was analyzed via an 84-gene angiogenesis PCR array and differentially expressed genes were confirmed with qRT-PCR. Based on the transcript data, Endothelin-1(ET-1), transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF&beta;3), and interleukin 6 (IL6) were chosen to perform confirmatory ELISA. Student&rsquo;s t-tests evaluated changes between NS and scar gene and protein expression and p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
PCR array identified a multitude of differentially expressed genes between scar and skin DMVECs. Three of the most-upregulated genes were ET-1, TGF&beta;3, and IL6 with 23.13-, 37.05-, and 12.96-fold change from NS, respectively (p&lt;0.01 each). qRT-PCR analysis from different scars and skin confirmed up-regulation of these three genes. For ET-1, all 4 scars showed up-regulation &gt;2-fold compared to NS. For TGF&beta;3, 3 out of 4 scars showed up-regulation &gt;2-fold compared to NS. For IL6, 3 out of 4 scars showed up-regulation &gt;2-fold compared to NS. ET-1 protein expression was significantly increased in scars 1-3 compared to NS. TGF&beta;3 protein expression was measured in 3 scars which all significantly differed compared to NS. IL6 protein expression in scars 1 and 2 was significantly increased compared to NS (Figure 1C). (p&lt;0.05)

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
DMVECs in HTSs have increased levels of gene and protein expression for ET-1, TGF&beta;3, and IL6 compared to DMVECs from NS. Further investigation of DMVECs is warranted.

Xu<sup>1</sup>, J. R. Mella Catinchi<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Miami, Plastic Surgery/Surgery, Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The incidence of lymphedema following axillary lymph node dissection may be as high as 65%. Lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach (LYMPHA) may reduce this risk to &lt; 5%. During axillary dissection, all lymphatic contents between the pectoralis major and minor, the latissimus dorsi posteriorly, the serratus anterior medially and the axillary vein cephalad are removed. While efforts are made to preserve the long thoracic nerve and thoracodorsal neurovascular bundle, venous tributaries from the axillary veins are often proximately ligated, which adds to the challenge of finding appropriate veins for LYMPHA. Any vein with a caliber &gt; 1mm and adequate length to reach lymphatic channels could be a suitable option for LYMPHA, but they are poorly characterized anatomically. The aim of this study is to identify and describe tributaries of the axillary vein that can be preserved during axillary dissection and utilized during lymphovenous bypass.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A total of four female cadavers, totaling eight axilla were evaluated (Fig). All veins with a diameter &gt;1mm found within the boundaries of a usual surgical axillary dissection were identified, preserved, and traced back to the axillary vein. The distance between the sternal notch (SN) and acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) was measured and used as a line of reference. Locations of branching veins were described using axillary vein and thoracodorsal vein as reference points.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Two veins, thoracoepigastric vein (Branch A) and intercostal tributary to the axillary vein (Branch B), were found to branch from the axillary vein in all axillas. These branches were located at a mean of 11.9 cm (Branch A) and 10.6 cm (Branch B) lateral to the sternal notch. The average caliber of the Branch A was 2.16 +/-0.68 mm and at 55% distance projected from SN. In 66% cases, it bifurcated into two branches 4.38 cm away from the axillary vein. Branch B had an average caliber of 2.29 +/- 0.21 mm and at 52% distance projected from SN. In 83% of the cases, branch B bifurcated into two branches 3.26 cm from the axillary vein.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The thoracoepigastric vein and intercostal tributary to the axillary vein are excellent venous options for creation of a lymphovenous bypass using the LYMPHA technique. Moreover, preservation of bifurcation points may allow for multiple bypasses into a single vein. Improved knowledge of axillary venous anatomy can guide the preservation of suitable options for LYMPHA during axillary dissection.

AAA is more likely to occur in men, but women have a greater risk of rupture, morbidity, and mortality. There is currently no effective medical therapy available for prevention of AAA growth and rupture. The monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) / C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) axis plays an important role in AAA development. We have previously demonstrated that CCR2 is a promising target for AAA rupture prediction. To build upon this, we aimed to evaluate whether CCR2 inhibition can decrease aortic tissue inflammation in an experimental rat AAA growth and rupture model


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 40 male and 49 female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent intraluminal aortic exposure to porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) to induce aneurysmal degeneration. Rats were also treated with intraperitoneal &beta;-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) over a 14-day period to stimulate AAA rupture. After 3 days of PPE exposure, a group of AAA rats (15 males, 17 females) were treated with a CCR2 inhibitor (RS-504393, CCR2i) via daily oral gavage while the remaining rats (25 males, 32 females) proceeded to rupture. PET imaging with <sup>64</sup>Cu-DOTA-ECL1i (a selective CCR2 radiomarker) and in vivo aortic diameter ultrasound assessment (12MHz) were performed at 7 and 14 days post-AAA induction. Animals were euthanized at 6 days post PPE administration, yet prior to rupture, and aortic tissue was collected for cytokine and MMP 9 activity analysis with ELISA and zymography, respectively.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: CCR2i treated groups showed significantly reduced AAA size in both males and females (171% &plusmn; 102 and 129% &plusmn; 83) when compared to the non-treated group (354% &plusmn; 145 and 193% &plusmn; 92), (p=0.0295 and p= &lt;0.0021) respectively. Furthermore, the rupture rate for female AAA rats significantly decreased from 44% in the non-treated group to 18% in the group treated with CCR2i. Male rates treated CCR2i did not demonstrate any AAA ruptures compared to 56% risk of rupture in the group that did not receive CCR2i (p value?). PET imaging of CCRi-treated rates demonstrated significantly reduced <sup>64</sup>Cu-DOTA-ECL1i signal in AAA tissue in both sexes (p = 0.0415, male; p = &lt;0.001, female). ELISA and zymography demonstrated significantly decreased IL-1B, CCL2, and MMP9 in rats treated with CCR2i in both sexes (Figure).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: CCR2 is upregulated in AAA tissue that is rupture prone. Our findings demonstrate that CCR2-targeting with CCR2i can lead to decreased AAA growth, risk of rupture, aortic inflammation, and MMP9 expression/activity. PET imaging confirms sensitivity of <sup>64</sup>Cu-DOTA-ECL1i for in vivo CCR2 imaging in aortic tissue. Taken together, our results suggest that CCR2 is a theranostic biomarker for AAA growth and rupture.

Fat grafting also has similar effects, but in a more local response. However, fat graft retention continues to hinder its long-term functionality secondary to inflammation and hypovascularity. Thus, we aimed to determine if vitamin E and pentoxifylline may have any local effects while simultaneously improving fat graft retention and mitigating radiation-induced fibrosis. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Ten adult CD-1 nude male mice at 6-8 weeks of age underwent scalp irradiation with 5 Gy every other day for 12 days, totaling in 30 Gy. Mice recovered for four weeks to allow chronic fibrosis to develop. After recovery, mice received 1000mL of donor human fat graft to the scalp (A). Mice were separated into 2 conditions: fat graft without treatment and graft impregnated with treatment. Fat graft volume retention was monitored in-vivo using microCT scans with 3-dimensional reconstruction and analysis at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 after grafting (B). Skin histological analysis and cytokine analysis of the fat graft were also performed. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Histological analysis demonstrated improvement in radiation-induced fibrosis (C). Fat graft volume retention significantly improved with treatment compared to control (D). Cytokine analysis revealed decreased cell inflammatory markers within the fat graft itself and the skin directly overlying the graft (E). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Radiation-induced fibrosis and fat graft volume retention are both simultaneously improved with local administration of vitamin E and pentoxifylline, improving both cosmesis and functionality of fat grafting in chronically irradiated fields.

Vascular reconstruction requires technical expertise and is often time consuming. As a novel alternative to traditional hand-sewn vascular anastomoses, the VasoLock (VL), is a nonabsorbable, sutureless anastomosis device with traction anchors designed to hold free artery and vein ends together (Figure 1). These anchors do not penetrate the vessel wall, but adhere by leveraging the elasticity of the vessels to fasten blood vessels together. This pilot study assesses the performance and patency of this novel device in a porcine model of femoral artery injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Female swine (n=7) underwent femoral artery exposure for a total of 10 VL implanted. Study animals underwent hemodilution to a target hematocrit of 15% and ROTEM was used to assess coagulopathy, followed by an arterial injury via transection. The VL was inserted without any sutures. Flow-probe monitors were positioned proximal and distal to the device and flow rates were measured continuously for a total of 90 minutes. Flow was analyzed and presented as a ratio of distal to proximal flow with the slope of this ratio across time subsequently determined. Angiographic assessment was completed to evaluate for patency and technical complications after 90 minutes of implant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The average animal weight was 44 &plusmn; 3 kg. During the 90 minute flow time, the average mean arterial pressure was 58 &plusmn; 3 mmHg, average heart rate was 92 &plusmn; 7 beats per minute, and average temperature was 35 &plusmn; 1 degrees Celsius. After hemodilution, baseline hematocrit was 11.7%, average pH was 7.20 &plusmn; 0.03, average clotting time was 157 &plusmn; 13 seconds and average clot formation time was 132 &plusmn; 11seconds all demonstrating the acidotic, hypothermic, and coagulopathic state of the swine at the time of insertion. During the 90 minute observation period, the average flow gradient identified across the VL was 0.99 &plusmn; 0.31 which indicates no significant change in flow across the VL. The average slope of the gradients was 0.004 &plusmn; 0.001, suggesting the ratio of proximal and distal flow did not change over the 90 minutes. Following 90 minutes of dwell time, all VL were patent without technical complication. Angiographic assessment at 90 minutes demonstrated no evidence of dissection, device dislodgement, arterial extravasation, or thromboembolism with any of the 10 devices.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This pilot study demonstrated technical feasibility of the novel VL device over a 90-minute observation period. All VL were patent and no negative events or complications were identified. This technology demonstrated significant promise in a coagulopathic state: additional investigation, involving long-term survival, is warranted for further validation.

The risks of burn pit exposures are of interest to both the lay public and scientific community; these burn continuously and are utilized to dispose a large variety and quantity of waste at military bases, and concern has been raised that they lead to significant disease in our deployed troops. Exposure to PM has been implicated as an aggravator and predisposing factor for autoimmune diseases, which affect 24.5 million Americans. Three major pathogenic mechanisms have been suggested for PM: genotoxicity, oxidative stress, and activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which adhere to PM, are known ligands of the AHR. Upon activation, AHR translocates to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor for a number of genes, including cytochrome P450 genes associated with toxin metabolism and immune inflammatory and immune regulatory pathways. Our lab has previously demonstrated that diesel exhaust particles (DEP), whether intact or following extraction with an organic solvent, contains AHR ligands. Furthermore, inhalation of either the intact or organic fraction of DEP in mice worsens clinical outcome in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis. The current study sought to assess whether the organic extract of a burn pit surrogate (BPS) PM sample also contains AHR activity and if it impacts EAE. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: To determine AHR ligand activity, a cell-based luciferase assay was utilized. Compared to a 1 to 1000 dilution of DEP (10mg/ml), our standard stock concentration used to treat mice in previous EAE experiments, equivalent AHR activity from BPS was achieved when BPS was diluted 1 to 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup>. Based on this finding, a preliminary experiment was performed. Female mice (n = 5 per group) were treated via intranasal route 8 times every 3 days with BPS or vehicle control diluted 1 to 2500. On the day of the 5<sup>th</sup> dose, EAE was induced and mice were scored daily on a 0 &ndash; 5 scale for disease symptoms. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 5 of 5 BPS treated mice showed incidence of disease, compared to 3 of 5 mice in the control group. BPS also had significantly greater (p &lt; 0.05) mean +/- std dev cumulative score (12.5 +/- 3.2) compared to control (4.9 +/-4.5) after 18 days followup, and trended towards getting disease earlier.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our preliminary results suggest that BPS contains high AHR activity. Exposure to BPS appears to exacerbate autoimmune disease with earlier onset and greater severity in vivo.

In the United States and western countries, it is a common side effect of cancer treatment such as lymphadenectomy and/or radiation therapy. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cisRA) significantly improves post-surgical lymphedema by promoting lymphangiogenesis. Despite its well-established lymphangiogenic effects, the signaling pathway of 9-cisRA has not been studied to date. 9-cisRA primarily interacts with Retinoic X receptors &alpha; (RXR&alpha;). However, little is known about the interaction between 9-cisRA and RXR&alpha; in the context of lymphangiogenesis. In this study, we sought to assess the role of RXR&alpha; in the pro-lymphangiogenic effect of 9-cisRA in vitro.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Human primary lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were transduced with shRNA lentiviral particles specifically targeting RXR&alpha; transcripts or scramble shRNA as a negative control. After transduction, RXR&alpha; knockdown (RXR&alpha; KD) and control LECs were treated with either 9-cisRA or vehicle. To test in vitro lymphangiogenesis, proliferation, migration, and tube formation assays were carried out. For proliferation assay, WST1 was used and absorbance was measured at 450nm. For migration, a 200uL pipette tip was used to scratch cells of a 100% confluent monolayer and images were taken at 0-, 24-, and 48-hour post-scratch. For tube formation, 2D Matrigel was used and images were taken at 18 hours. Images were analyzed using Fiji ImageJ and ANOVA and paired t-tests were performed for statistical analysis with P&lt;0.05 as significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A successful knockdown of RXR&alpha; in human LECs was confirmed with RT-qPCR (Figure 1. A and B). We observed that RXR&alpha; knockdown affected baseline cell proliferation and differentiation. RXR&alpha; KD showed significantly reduced cell proliferation compared to the control in the absence of 9-cisRA treatment. When 9-cisRA was added, there was no significant change in proliferation of RXR&alpha; KD (Figure 1C). Migration assay was analyzed at 24- and 48- hour post-scratch relative to 0-hour as a baseline (Figure 1D). At 48-hour, RXR&alpha; KD showed significantly slower migration and greater remaining wound area even in the presence of 9-cisRA compared to the control (Figure 1E). Similarly, the number of tubes and branch points was significantly decreased in RXR&alpha; KD compared to the control regardless of 9-cisRA treatment.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our data demonstrate that 9-cisRA does not exert pro-lymphangiogenic effects in LECs when RXR&alpha; pathway is compromised, suggesting that RXR&alpha; is important in 9-cisRA mediated lymphangiogenesis in vitro.

The aim was to compare outcomes of isolated HF patients who received only an orthopedic pre-operative consultation to those with additional consultations.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This IRB approved retrospective study included 132 patients admitted to a level 1 trauma center from 2016 to 2021 with isolated HF (femoral neck and intertrochanteric) who were compared in two groups: 59 patients with no additional consultation besides orthopedic (NC) and 73 patients with additional consultations (C). Analyzed variables included: age, comorbidities, pre-injury anticoagulation, mechanism of injury (MOI), day of admission, HF and surgery types, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score, time to HF surgery, intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay (ICULOS, HLOS), complications, and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Group C was significantly older than NC (80 vs 69 y.o.) with more geriatric (&ge;65 y.o.) patients (86% vs 56%), all p&lt;0.001. Falls was predominant MOI in both groups (&ge;80%). Distribution of admissions by day of the week was not different, p=0.2. Comorbidities and pre-injury anticoagulation use were significantly higher in Group C (99% vs 88% and 59% vs 27%, both p&lt;0.001). Within comorbidities, cardiac were significantly higher in Group C (88% vs 53%, p&lt;0.001). Additional cardiology consultation was the most common (73%), followed by neurology (18%). Average time from admission to cardiology consultation was the longest at 15 hours. Rate of echocardiography before surgery was significantly higher in C (16% vs 2%, p=0.005) and done on average 22 hours after admission. In both groups the most common HF type was intertrochanteric (53% vs 61%) and Open Reduction with Internal Fixation (62% vs 80%) was the most common HF surgery. Group C had statistically higher but clinically insignificant mean ASA score (2.9 vs 2.6, p=0.02). Time to HF surgery was significantly longer in Group C (27 vs 18 hours, p&lt;0.001). ICULOS and HLOS were not statistically different (6 vs 5 and 7 vs 6 days, both p&gt;0.4). Rate of complications was similar in C and NC (p=0.6) [Figure 1]. Mortality rates were low and comparable for C and NC (3% vs 0%, p=0.2).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients with isolated hip fractures who received additional consultations beyond orthopedic were older, with more cardiac comorbidities and higher anticoagulation use. Additional consultations delayed time to HF surgery by almost 10 hours and increased the rate of additional diagnostic procedures; however, these patients had comparable outcomes to patients without additional consultations. Indications for consultations should be revised and follow stricter guidelines.

The aim was to analyze these patient&rsquo;s characteristics and to present management recommendations.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This IRB approved, retrospective study included 249 patients admitted to two level 1 Trauma Centers with TBI from low energy trauma who had at least one emergency head surgery (craniotomy, craniectomy, burr hole). Low energy trauma was defined as a ground-level fall. Two groups were compared. Group 1, had 157 patients who had only one surgery. Group 2, had 92 patients: 32 (35%) who had a 2<sup>nd</sup> head surgery and 60 who had indications but did not get the intervention due to advanced directives or excessive bleeding. Analyzed variables included: age, gender, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Scale for Head (AISH), Marshall score, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, CT findings and timing, neurological examination dynamic, mechanical ventilation requirements, complications, intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay (ICULOS, HLOS). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Patients in two groups were of similar age (68 vs 72), majority were male (62% in both), and prevalence of geriatric patients (&ge;65 y.o.) was comparable (64 vs 71%), all p&gt;0.1. Group 1 compared to Group 2 had significantly higher GCS (13 vs 10), lower ISS (23 vs 26), AISH (4.6 vs 4.9), Marshall score (3 vs 4), and ASA (3 vs 4) at admission, all p&lt;0.001 [Figure 1]. The predominant surgery type in both groups was a craniotomy, but significantly more burr holes were done in Group 1 than Group 2 (13% vs 1%, p=0.001). Mean time to first CT after first surgery was 5 hours in Group 1 and 4 hours in Group 2 (p=0.09). Negative changes on postoperative CT within 24 hours of first surgery were significantly more common in Group 2 than Group 1 (67% vs 26%), and so was negative postoperative neurological dynamic (49% vs 19%), both p&lt;0.001. Significantly more patients in Group 2 than Group 1 required mechanical ventilation (77% vs 33%), ICU admission (100% vs 95%), and had more complications (57% vs 30%), all p&lt;0.001. ICULOS and HLOS were not different between groups. Multivariable and Receiver Operator Characteristics analyses showed GCS, Marshall and ASA Scores as significant independent predictors for 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery with threshold values of 12; 3; and 4 respectively. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Low energy head trauma is common, especially in the growing geriatric population. GCS, Marshall, and ASA scores were significant predictors of second head surgery. We recommend that low energy TBI patients with GCS &lt;12, Marshall Score &ge;3, and ASA Score &ge;4 undergo mandatory postoperative CT within 4 hours after surgery.

Kelz<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania, Surgery, Philadelphia, PA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Pennsylvania, Perelman School Of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Multimorbidity is a major health challenge, and often difficult to define. Given the high (and increasing) prevalence of multiple comorbidities among an aging American population, a system to stratify risk among these patients is necessary. Qualifying Comorbidity Sets are specific combinations of comorbid conditions shown to be associated with increased risk of post-operative mortality. It is unknown whether these Qualifying Comorbidity Sets are also associated with increased mortality risk for non-operative management of surgical conditions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Medicare beneficiaries, age 65 and older, who presented to a hospital with an Emergency General Surgery (EGS) condition, and underwent non-operative management of that condition, were identified using New York, Florida and Pennsylvania discharge data (2012-2013). Patients were classified as multimorbid using the 113 Qualifying Comorbidity Sets defined by Silber, et al. Risk adjusted outcomes for multimorbid patients were calculated using hierarchical regression with a Poisson distribution. Two reference populations were used: one including all patients without a Qualifying Comorbidity Set (non-multimorbid) and the other consisting of the subset of non-multimorbid patients who had 3+ Elixhauser comorbidities.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified 477,346 patients who underwent non-operative management of an EGS condition as multimorbid, making up a large minority (39.4%) of included patients. Of the 734,695 non-multimorbid patients, only 3.5% had zero Elixhauser comorbidities, while 64.5% of non-multimorbid patients had 3+ Elixhauser comorbidities. In examining adjusted incidence risk ratios for in-hospital mortality, 77 (68%) of the 113 Qualifying Comorbidity Sets were significantly associated with increased risk of mortality when compared to non-multimorbid patients and 75 (66%) when compared to those with 3+ comorbidities. See Table for the top 5 Qualifying Comorbidity Sets associated with an increased adjusted mortality risk. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Older patients identified as multimorbid, based on Qualifying Comorbidity Sets, have increased risk of mortality when compared to non-multimorbid patients, including patients with 3+ comorbidities, for non-operative management of EGS conditions. This highlights the need to consider complex interactions across comorbidities when stratifying risk, not just counting the number of comorbid conditions. Qualifying Comorbidity Sets represent a valuable way to assess risk of mortality after non-operative management for EGS conditions.

Morris<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Gastro-Intestinal Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Older patients have unique needs in the perioperative period, and little is known about their perception of wellbeing in the perioperative setting. In this study, we compared the patient&rsquo;s perception of wellbeing preoperatively, at discharge and 30-day post-operatively.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We prospectively enrolled geriatric patients aged 65 or above undergoing complex gastrointestinal surgeries at a single large academic medical center. The participant&rsquo;s wellbeing was assessed using the PROMIS-SF Global health survey preoperative, at-discharge, and 30-day postoperatively. The PROMIS-SF Global health survey has 9 questions which assess the patient&rsquo;s physical health, mental health, quality of life, fatigue, and satisfaction with relationships and social activities. 

Patient demographics were recorded. Statistical analysis included using repeated measures modelling to detect differences between the patient reported responses and using Tukey&rsquo;s HSD post-hoc testing to determine which survey times were different. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our study included 163 patients of which 54 % were female. The mean age in years was 73 (range 65-99 years).

The Patient demographics included: White: 131 (80.36%), African American 31 (19.01%), Asian 1 (0.6%), Unreported 1(0.6%). The types of surgeries included: colectomy- 23 (29.87%), pancreatectomy 15 (19.48%), proctectomy 13 (16.88%), ostomy reversal 5 (6.49%), foregut surgery 1 (1.3%), Other 20 (25.97%).

Patients reported no change in 5 of the 9 survey measures during the perioperative period including: general health, quality of life, physical health, mental health, and satisfaction with social activities and relationships. Patients did have a change in PROMIS measures 6, 8, and 9 in the perioperative period. For PROMIS measure 6, patients perception of their ability to perform everyday physical activities increased significantly between pre-opeartively and discharge (LSM: -0.73; p&lt;0.0001) and decreased significantly between discharge and 30 days post-operatively (LSM: 0.78; p&lt;0.0001). For PROMIS measure 8, patients reported their fatigue levels significantly increased from discharge to 30 days post-operatively (LSM:-0.39; p=0.01). For PROMIS measure 9, patients reported their satisfaction with social activities and roles increased between pre-operative and discharge (LSM:-0.38; p=0.01).

 <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Our study shows that the older adult patients undergoing complex abdominal surgery feel an increased sense of wellbeing immediately after surgery at the time of discharge. However, this increased sense of wellbeing does not seem to last at the 30-day postoperative follow up.

While the cornerstone of management of adhesive SBO includes nasogastric (NG) decompression and bowel rest, in the absence of an acute abdomen there are no definitive guidelines regarding optimal timing of surgical intervention. The purpose of this study is to compare the differences in management and outcomes between the traditional private practice model, in which a patient is typically managed by one surgeon, and the acute care surgery (ACS) model, in which a patient may be seen by multiple different surgeons, at an urban community hospital. We hypothesize that patients with adhesive SBO who are managed by the private practice group will have a shorter LOS and decreased time to operative intervention when compared to patients managed by the ACS service.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is an IRB-approved, single institution, retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with adhesive SBO from 01/01/2019 to 12/23/2020. Patients were included if they were 18 years of age or older and had been diagnosed with adhesive SBO with a history of abdominal surgery. Patients were excluded if they had a history of abdominal or pelvic malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, external hernia, pregnancy, or an intra-abdominal infection. Both hospital LOS and time to operative intervention were analyzed using a Wilcoxon test, with a p-value &lt;0.05 used to determine significance. 30-day readmission rates were analyzed using a chi-squared test using a p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 122 patients were eligible for study inclusion; there were 60 patients in the private practice group and 62 patients in the ACS group. Patient demographics were similar in each group. A similar proportion of patients required surgical intervention in each group: 28.3% in the private practice group versus 26.2% in the ACS group (p=0.80). The ACS group had a statistically significant shorter time to surgery with an average of 1 day compared to 3.6 days in the private practice group (p=0.045). After controlling for patients who presented with an acute surgical abdomen requiring emergency surgery, the time to surgery was still shorter in the ACS group (1.4 days versus 4.3 days) however the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.25). There was no statistically significant difference in the amount of imaging studies obtained, hospital length of stay, post-operative complications, or 30-day readmission between the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study aimed to compare differences in outcomes between a traditional private practice group and an ACS group at an urban, community hospital. While the time to surgery was shorter in the ACS group, overall outcomes, hospital LOS and post-operative complications did not significantly differ. Although the sample size is small, this study suggests that the care of patients with SBO at a community hospital is neither delayed nor harmed by a multiple-surgeon, ACS model.

Multimorbidity is a major health challenge, and older patients with comorbidities are more likely to suffer poor surgical outcomes. Qualifying Comorbidity Sets (QCS) are specific combinations of comorbid conditions shown to be associated with increased risk of post-operative mortality. However, many Emergency General Surgery conditions can be managed without an operation. We hypothesize that outcomes differ between operative and non-operative management of Emergency General Surgery conditions among older, multimorbid patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Medicare beneficiaries, age 65 and older, who presented to a hospital with an Emergency General Surgery condition were identified using New York, Florida and Pennsylvania discharge data (2012-2013). Patients were classified as multimorbid using the 113 Qualifying Comorbidity Sets defined by Silber, et al. Risk adjusted outcomes for multimorbid patients were calculated using hierarchical regression with a Poisson distribution and compared to non-multimorbid patients (those with 3+ Elixhauser comorbidities without a Qualifying Comorbidity Set). Operative and non-operative patients were analyzed separately to minimize selection bias on treatment outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A large minority of patients in both the operative (OP) and non-operative (Non-OP) groups were found to be multimorbid (OP 37.4% vs Non-OP 39.4%), and more multimorbid patients were managed non-operatively than operatively (Non-OP 477,346 vs OP 116,900). OP and Non-OP patients had similar rates of in-hospital mortality (OP 10.5% vs Non-OP 10.6%, p = 0.624). Length of stay was longer for the OP groups (OP 10.4 days &plusmn; 13.5 vs Non-OP 5.1 days &plusmn; 7, p &lt; 0.005) and OP patients were less likely to be discharged to home (OP 37.3% vs Non-OP 46.2%, p &lt; 0.005). Five of the top 10 Qualifying Comorbidity Sets associated with increased risk of mortality were identical between the OP and Non-OP groups. See Table for these adjusted incidence risk ratios.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The majority of older patients undergo Non-OP management for Emergency General Surgery conditions. Older patients identified as multimorbid, based on Qualifying Comorbidity Sets, have increased risk of mortality when compared to non-multimorbid patients for both OP and Non-OP management of Emergency General Surgery conditions. Although mortality rates were similar across OP and Non-OP groups, OP patients spent more time in the hospital during their initial admission and were less likely to be discharged to home.

Peschman<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Gundersen Health System, Surgery, La Crosse, WISCONSIN, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Medical College Of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Adhesive small bowel obstruction is one of the most common reasons for surgical admission and emergent surgical intervention. Recently, protocolized treatment strategies have been developed for management of these patients. We sought to survey staff at a community-based academic hospital on their experience with the treatment of small bowel obstructions and perceived barriers to implementation of a hospital-wide protocol.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This study was completed at a community-based academic hospital in the Midwest. An anonymous electronic survey was distributed to three cohorts of healthcare providers with a 20 day window who care for patients with adhesive small bowel obstructions (SBO): (1) surgeons/residents/nurse practitioners/physician assistants, (2) nurses, (3) radiologists. Response assessed interest in and perceived barriers to implementation of a protocol for the treatment of adhesive SBO. Descriptive statistics were reported.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall survey completion rate was 68% of 114 surveyed (n=78). Completion rate was 82% (n=27), 75% (n=42), and 36% (n=9) for cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. While 77% of responders had never used a protocolized approach, 89% would be likely to use a protocol if it were implemented. Most participants felt implementation would improve patient care (92%) and decrease patient length of stay (86%). While 79% of cohort 1 perceived that treatment plans for patients with SBO frequently changed due to transition of care to other providers, only 51% of cohort 2 perceived this. The largest barriers to implementation, identified amongst cohort 1, were inexperience with a protocol for SBO (44%) and preference for individualized care of SBO (36%).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Healthcare providers are willing to use a treatment protocol for patients with SBO, even if they have not used one previously. Most respondents felt a guideline would have positive effects on patient care, decrease changes in patient treatment plans and address current patient frustration with variability in treatment. Barriers include inexperience with a formal protocol for these patients and a desire for individualized care.

Ehlers<sup>1</sup>, B. Fry<sup>1</sup>, D. Telem<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Posterior component separation (pCS) is a newer technique with data suggesting an improved complication profile compared to anterior component separation (aCS). Both an understanding of whether surgeons have shifted to adopt this technique as well as its impact on patient outcomes remains unknown across the general population. In this context, we sought to examine the application of component separation (CS) in a statewide surgical quality collaborative. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using a clinically nuanced, population-level hernia registry, the Michigan Surgery Quality Collaborative Hernia Registry (MSQC-HR), implemented in January of 2020, we performed an analysis of adult patients undergoing VHR between January 1, 2020, and July 1, 2021. The exposure of interest was use of CS. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of 30-day adverse events including complications, emergency department visit, readmission, and reoperation. The secondary outcome was surgical site infection (SSI). Multivariable analyses were performed accounting for patient, hernia, and operation characteristics to evaluate the independent association of patient and hernia factors associated with CS as well as the association between CS use and 30-day adverse events and SSI.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1,319 patients underwent VHR with a mean age of 54+15 years, 641 (48.6%) female patients, and a mean BMI of 33+8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. CS was used in 138 (10.5%) patients, of which 101 (73.2%) were pCS and 37 (26.8%) were aCS. Compared to patients who did not undergo CS, patients with CS had larger median (range) hernia widths (2.5cm (0.01-23) vs 8cm (1-30), P&lt;0.001), however there was no difference in median hernia width between pCS and aCS (8cm (1.5-30) and 7cm (1-20), P=0.735). On multivariable regression, use of CS was associated with higher odds of an adverse postoperative event (OR 1.88 [95% CI 1.13-3.12]), but was not associated with increased odds of SSI (OR 1.85 [95% CI 0.74-4.63]). In comparing pCS to aCS, rates of 30-day adverse events (32 (31.7%) vs. 9 (24.3%), P=0.402) and SSI (10 (9.9%) vs. 2 (5.4%), P=0.406) were not different.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These data demonstrate widespread adoption of pCS at the population level with nearly 3 out of 4 component separations in Michigan being performed in this manner, independent of hernia size. CS SSI rates appear to be consistent with current data. In this initial cohort there we no differences found in adverse events and SSI when comparing pCS and aCS, however, a larger sample size with long-term follow-up on this data is necessary. Future work will analyze the application and longer-term outcomes of CS techniques in the general population to identify and improve potential gaps in care for this common and morbid disease.

Approximately 300,000 ventral hernia operations are performed each year, and up to 30% of these patients have chronic pain disorders. Furthermore, preoperative opioid use has been shown to be associated with worse patient outcomes after surgery. However, little is known about the affect of preoperative benzodiazepine (BDZ) use alone or in combination with opioids. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the influence of preoperative substance use (including opioids, benzodiazepines or both) on ventral hernia repair outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The Pennsylvania Opioid Surgical Stewardship Enterprise is an initiative through the Pennsylvania NSQIP Consortium that includes 10 hospitals dedicated to improving surgical quality, patient safety and outcomes. Custom substance use variables were created and collected by ACS-NSQIP Surgical Clinical Reviewers from September 1, 2019 to February 26, 2020 and then linked with NSQIP patient, procedure and outcome data. Cohorts were then compared by Chi square, Mann-Whitney-U and Kruskal Wallis tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of 483 patients studied, 50% (N=251) were female with a median age of 58. Opioid use patients represented 14% (N=69) of the population, and 7.2% (N=35) were on benzodiazepines preoperatively while 2.9% (N=14) were on both opioids and benzodiazepines. Opioid use compared to opioid na&iuml;ve patients were more likely to be female (62% vs. 48%, p &lt; 0.03), but comparable with respect to age, BMI and ASA scores. In addition, patients on preoperative opioids had significantly longer operations (98 vs. 82 minutes, p &lt; 0.02) as well as increased (p &lt;0.05) overall morbidity (17% vs. 5.6%), serious morbidity (8.7% vs. 3.4%), reintubations (2.9% vs. 0.2%), deep surgical site infections (2.9% vs. 0.5%) and urinary tract infections (5.8% vs. 0.7%). Patients on benzodiazepines were statistically similar at baseline compared to those who were not on BDZs (p &gt; 0.05), although tended to be female (66% vs. 49%, p = 0.05). Operative time was 52 minutes longer (134 vs. 82 minutes, p = 0.006) in patients on BDZs. Moreover, urinary tract infections (5.7% vs. 1.1%) and wound dehiscence (2.9% vs. 0.2%) both were significantly (p &lt;0.05) higher for BDZ use compared to BDZ na&iuml;ve patients. Finally, patients on both preoperative opioids and BDZs had significantly longer operations (173 minutes, p &lt; 0.02), higher rates of overall morbidity, urinary tract infections, and longer length of stay compared to opioid/BDZ na&iuml;ve patients (Table).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients undergoing ventral hernia repair on preoperative opioids have significantly increased postoperative morbidity. Patients on preoperative opioids and benzodiazepines also suffer from increased morbidity and represent a unique population that warrants further investigation.

With the increase in lifespan due to improved healthcare facilities, the percentage of elderly patients continues to rise in the United States. As a healthcare center that serves a large elderly population, we decided to investigate the outcomes of colon resection in patients &ge;80-years-old to improve our ability to offer better pre-operative counseling, manage patient expectations and channel our resources efficiently. We aim to identify modifiable factors affecting their postoperative course and explore the role of co-management of these patients with internists. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing colon resections at our hospital from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on their age, &ge;80-years-old vs &lt;80-years-old. We collected patient demographics, comorbidities and postoperative outcomes. Welch&rsquo;s t-test and Fisher&rsquo;s exact test were used to identify the effect of patient variables on surgical outcomes. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 1152 patients undergoing colon resections, 183 (15.8%) were &ge;80-years-old. Mean age of this group was 85.3 years vs 61.3 years for patients &lt;80-years-old. Patients &ge;80-years-old were more likely to have a higher body mass index (30.1 vs 27.2; p &lt; 0.001) and medical comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15.3% vs 9.1%; p =0.02) and hypertension (70.5% vs 51.7%; p&lt;0.001). Patients &ge;80-years-old were more likely to have a longer length of stay (9.8 vs 8.3 days; p = 0.001), higher 30-day mortality (11.5% vs 3.2%; p &lt; 0.001) and greater frequency of postoperative complications (Table 1). Subgroup analysis revealed that elderly patients undergoing surgery for complicated diverticular disease were more likely to have higher 30-day mortality compared to younger patients, but there was no statistically significant difference in mortality for those undergoing surgery for cancer in either group. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Patients &ge;80-years-old undergoing colon resection were more likely to experience a higher 30-day mortality compared to younger patients due to their pre-existing medical comorbidities. These patients may benefit from better pre-operative optimization and postoperative care that accounts for their complex baseline health issues. Given these findings, our institution plans to develop a co-management system involving the internists to manage these medically complicated patients in an attempt to improve their postoperative outcomes.

Wandling<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Health Science Center At Houston, Department Of Surgery, Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The optimal management for intermediate risk choledocholithiasis (IR-CDL) has yet to be defined. Accepted algorithms include magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and LC with or without intra-operative cholangiogram (LC&plusmn;IOC). At our safety-net hospital, patients with IR-CDL often proceed directly to LC&plusmn;IOC. We sought to 1) evaluate our management strategies for IR-CDL and 2) identify predictors of positive IOC in IR-CDL.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients &ge; 16 years of age with IR-CDL who had a LC during their index hospitalization between March 2018 and March 2020 were included. In accordance with established criteria, IR-CDL was defined as total bilirubin of 1.8-4.0 mg/dL, a common bile duct (CBD) &ge;0.6cm, or gallstone pancreatitis. To assess management strategies for IR-CDL, we examined the use of initial LC+IOC, initial LC alone, and MRCP followed by LC&plusmn;IOC. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify predictors of positive IOC.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 426 patients who met inclusion criteria, 60% (n=254) had initial LC+IOC, 35% (n=151) had initial LC alone, and 3% (n=13) had MRCP followed by LC&plusmn;IOC. Among those undergoing initial LC+IOC, 33% (n=86) of had a positive IOC, 58% (n=147) had a negative IOC, and 9% (n=22) were unsuccessful. No differences in age, sex, race, BMI, or presenting vital signs were found between those with positive and negative IOCs. Of patients with positive IOC, all were managed successfully with postoperative ERCP, CBD exploration, or observation at time of hospitalization. Of patients with initial MRCP, 31% (n=4) were positive for CDL. Univariate analysis identified elevated AP and TB to be predictive of positive IOC (Table 1). Multivariate analysis showed that elevated AP was the strongest predictor of positive IOC (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.3). There was no difference in elevated TB (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.8-2.9), CBD diameter (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.4-4.7), or presence of GP (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.6-2.2).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Initial LC+IOC was the predominant choice for initial management of IR-CDL at our safety-net hospital. The only significant predictor of a positive IOC in IR-CDL preoperatively was elevated AP. In the absence of strong clinical predictors of CDL among this patient cohort, initial LC+IOC is a viable management strategy. Further investigation into the optimal management algorithm for IR-CDL is warranted.

However, the differences in outcomes between elective and unplanned procedures for these conditions are unknown. The objective of this study was to compare elective versus unplanned outcomes of surgical patients with access sensitive surgical conditions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The study was a cross-sectional retrospective review of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent one of three access sensitive surgical conditions-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, colectomy for colorectal cancer, and incisional hernia repair-between 2014 to 2018. Risk-adjusted outcomes using a multivariable logistical regression that adjusted for patient factors (age, sex, race, and Elixhauser comorbidities), hospital characteristics (ownership, size, geographic region, surgical volume) and type of operation were compared between planned and unplanned (urgent and emergent) surgical procedures. Main outcome measures were thirty-day mortality, readmission, and preventable events.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 744,818 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing access sensitive surgical procedures, 259,541 (34.9%) were unplanned. Compared to beneficiaries who had elective procedures, patients who underwent unplanned procedures experienced higher rates of thirty-day mortality (3.65% vs 8.15%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.05-2.09; p&lt;0.001) and readmissions (12.88% vs 16.28%; OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.29-1.3; p&lt;0.001). While it is unlikely that all unplanned procedures could have been performed electively and mirror those outcomes, doing so would have prevented an estimated 11,703 deaths and 8,829 readmissions.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Unplanned surgery for access sensitive surgical conditions was common among Medicare beneficiaries and associated with higher rates of thirty-day mortality and readmissions. These findings suggest that improving elective access for these conditions may reduce preventable adverse events.

Ibrahim<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Ohio State University, Surgery, Columbus, OH, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Michigan, Surgery, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Decades of scholarly activity have demonstrated wide and persistent racial disparities among patients undergoing surgery. Despite the broad documentation of these disparities, little work has been in helping elucidate and understand the root cause of these racial disparities. On one hand, observed disparities may be driven by differences in the lived environment such as housing, employment, and education. On the other hand, the root cause of racial disparities may be attributable to the long-lasting and far-reaching effects of structural disparities such as racism.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a cross-sectional retrospective review of 1,953,057 Medicare beneficiaries from 1,610,884 neighborhoods between 2014 and 2018 who underwent appendectomy, cholecystectomy, hernia repair, colectomy, or coronary artery bypass. We then stratified patients into quintiles based on their neighborhood deprivation as measured by the Area Deprivation Index; a census tract level measure of structural disadvantage such as housing, employment, and education. Using a multivariable logistic regression model accounting for patient age, gender, procedure, health comorbidities, and hospital characteristics we determined the risk-adjusted 30-day mortality. We then investigated the interaction of race and neighborhood deprivation on 30-day postoperative mortality. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The overall age and sex of patients did not vary consistently across neighborhoods. However, the proportion of Black beneficiaries residing in neighborhoods significantly increased from 4.7% in the lowest deprivation neighborhoods to 16.7% within the highest deprivation neighborhoods (p&lt;0.001). Overall risk-adjusted 30-day mortality for White beneficiaries was 5.6% (95% CI 5.5-5.6) compared to 6.5% (95% CI 6.4-6.6) among Black beneficiaries (OR: 1.13, 95% CI 1.10-1.15). Within the highest quintile of deprivation there was no difference in 30-day mortality between White (6.44, 95%CI 6.36-6.53) and Black (6.82, 95% CI 6.63-7.00) (OR:1.00, 95% CI 0.96-1.04). Although mortality significantly improved with every 10-point decrease in deprivation for both White (OR: 1.05, 95%CI 1.05-1.05) and Black (OR: 1.03, 95% CI 1.03-1.03) beneficiaries, the effect was greater among white beneficiaries. Withing the lowest quintile of deprivation, White beneficiaries had significantly lower mortality (4.6, 95%CI 4.6-4.7) compared with Black beneficiaries (5.9, 95% CI 5.6-6.3), a 1.3% absolute difference in mortality (OR:1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.36).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A lower deprivation index was associated with lower mortality for both White and Black beneficiaries. However, the decrease in mortality was far greater for White beneficiaries compared to Black beneficiaries, creating a widening disparity that worsened as neighborhoods improved. In other words, although the least deprived neighborhoods had the lowest mortality for both White and Black beneficiaries, these neighborhoods also had the widest disparity in mortality.

Patient-provider shared decision-making regarding modality and timing of definitive therapy for Graves&rsquo; disease requires good communication. We sought to determine whether there were differences in outcomes for patients who do not speak English as their primary language compared to English-speaking patients at a safety net hospital with a high-volume endocrine surgery practice. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Retrospective review of patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for Graves&rsquo; disease from 2012-19. Each patient was classified as English-speaking or non-English-speaking based on primary language reported in the chart. Demographics, preoperative factors, and postoperative outcomes were compared between English- and non-English-speaking patients using chi-square analyses and t-tests. Postoperative complications were considered temporary if &lt;6 months or permanent if &ge;6 months. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to compare the odds of any operative complication between English- and non-English-speaking patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to compare time from surgery to euthyroidism (0.35
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 233 patients, 61% were English-speaking and 39% were non-English speaking. Compared to non-English-speaking patients, more English-speaking patients were non-Hispanic white (35% v. 11%, p&lt;0.001), had commercial insurance (33% v. 13%, p&lt;0.001), and had preoperative thyroid eye disease (54% v. 37%, p=0.01). Complication rates were low and comparable across language groups: temporary hypoparathyroidism (19% vs. 16%) and temporary voice change (4% vs. 5%) for English- and non-English-speaking patients, respectively. Permanent complications occurred in &lt;1% overall. After adjusting for age, sex, race, and presence of eye disease, non-English-speaking patients had similar odds of experiencing a thyroid-specific complication (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.44-1.72). Median time from surgery to euthyroidism was similar between English- and non-English-speaking patients (114 days vs. 103 days, p=0.41, Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Outcomes for patients with Graves&rsquo; disease treated operatively were good, and there were no differences between non-English-speaking patients and English-speaking patients. These findings suggest that high-volume endocrinology and endocrine surgery programs can provide high quality and equitable care to patients with Graves&rsquo; disease, regardless of language barriers and that dedicated strategies to address language barriers may contribute to equitable outcomes.

Cholecystectomy is one of the common procedures among the various acute care surgeries performed in the US and thus we aim to study racial disparities in its outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients who underwent emergent cholecystectomy were identified from the ACS-NSQIP database (2013-2018). We analyzed multiple surgical outcomes including operative time, total length of stay, and return to the operating room, reintubations, cardiac arrest, transfusion requirements, wound infections, and acute renal failure.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 1542 identified cases of emergent cholecystectomy. Patients were identified as nonwhite if they were identified as either Black or African America, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. Most of the patients were labeled as white (83.34%). Nonwhites were more likely to be diabetic (33.4% vs 21.2%), hypertensive requiring medication (55.2% vs 47.5%), have a history of CHF (5.4% vs 2.4%), on dialysis (8.2% vs 2.3%) and have an ASA class greater than 3 (57.6% vs 53.3%). White patients were more likely to have a history of COPD (3.5% vs 6.9%,) and be smokers (15.9% vs 19.4%). Total length of stay differed significantly between nonwhite and white. Logistic regression demonstrated that postoperative outcomes in nonwhites such as organ space infections (OR=1.41), pneumonia (OR=2.74), and return to operating room (OR=1.56) were statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: On a 5-year review of emergent cholecystectomies from a national surgical database the racial disparities remain pervasive. Investment in challenging underlying health disparities should continue as this study demonstrates nonwhite patients have higher number of comorbidities prior to the operating room. Further research is required to identify additional risk factors and strategies to bridge disparities in surgical outcomes for these patients.

Huang<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Utah, Department Of General Surgery, Salt Lake City, UT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Overdose deaths involving opioids have more than doubled in the past decade. In 2019, 71% of the 71,000 overdose deaths in the United States involved prescription opioids. Eleven percent of those who died from overdoses received their opioid prescription from a surgeon. The goal of this study was 1) to determine the rate of naloxone co-prescribing for patients prescribed opioids after surgery and 2) to identify the patient-level factors associated with naloxone co-prescribing.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical record of patients prescribed opioids at a single academic health center between 07/2020-05/2021. We included all patients who underwent a cardiothoracic, general, otolaryngology, plastics, transplant, urology, vascular procedure and were prescribed opioids upon discharge. Our primary outcome was a naloxone prescription made at least once during the study period. We examined patient-level factors (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity, history of substance abuse) associated with naloxone co-prescribing.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
10,793 patients were included. Overall, 261 (2.42%) of patients were co-prescribed naloxone. In the subset of 6,008 patients who received &ge;150 morphine milligram equivalents (MME), only 194 (3.23%) were co-prescribed naloxone. We generated a multivariate regression model and found that male sex, white race, rural home location, prescriptions of &gt;150 MME, and history of substance use disorder (SUD) were associated with naloxone prescribing.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:
Overall naloxone co-prescription rates are low in patients undergoing surgery. Despite being higher than for low-risk patients, naloxone co-prescription rates are low even for patients at risk of overdose due to a large opioid prescription or a history of substance abuse. Additionally, race and rurality may impact how often patients are given naloxone. Further research is needed to 1) identify patients at risk of overdose, 2) understand how biases by providers, pharmacists, and other hospital staff may influence co-prescribing rates, and 3) develop and test interventions to increase naloxone co-prescribing in surgery patients.

Because less is known about the mechanism underlying these differences, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between social vulnerability and disparities in unplanned surgery among Medicare beneficiaries.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Cross sectional review of 707,739 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent procedures for one of three access sensitive conditions (abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, ventral hernia repair, colectomy for colorectal cancer) between 2014 to 2018. This data was then merged with the Center for Disease Control&rsquo;s Social Vulnerability Index, a composite score of 15 social factors including housing, transportation, and education level, at the county level of residence. We evaluated risk adjusted rates of unplanned surgery, thirty-day mortality, any complications, serious complications, reoperations, and readmission, using a logistic regression model accounting for age, gender, comorbidities, year, procedure type and hospital characteristics, between high and low social vulnerability quintiles.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Medicare beneficiaries living in areas of higher social vulnerability were more likely to undergo unplanned surgery and have worse outcomes. The overall rate of unplanned surgery was 34.7% (n=245,516) but varied widely based on the vulnerability of a county (high vs low social vulnerability: 36.19% vs 33.26%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.16; p&lt;0.001). Compared to beneficiaries who had low social vulnerability, patient with high social vulnerability experienced higher rates of thirty-day mortality (5.37% vs 5.01%; OR, 1.05; p&lt;0.001), any complications (26.44% vs 24.78%; OR, 1.10; p&lt;0.001), and reoperations (19.63% vs 18.12%; OR, 1.16; p&lt;0.001). Within elective procedures only or unplanned procedures only, there were no differences in outcomes across quintiles of social vulnerability. Taken together, the overall disparities in outcomes can be attributed to the differential rates of unplanned surgery.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Overall disparities in surgical outcomes across high and low social vulnerability is driven by differential rates of unplanned surgery. The findings suggest that improving access for these conditions should be an important target for quality improvement efforts aimed at addressing disparities in communities with structural disadvantage.

Mariadason<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Metropolitan Hospital Center, Surgery, New York, NEW YORK, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Historically, appendicoliths (fecaliths) were believed to be the main cause of appendicitis in adults while lymphoid hyperplasia was thought to be the usual culprit in children. However, it has become apparent that acute appendicitis associated with appendicoliths may be more prevalent in the pediatric population than in adults; 29.9% compared to 13.7% for adults in one study (1). The presence of appendicoliths is associated with perforation in several studies. In the adult population non-operative management has become a popular option except when a fecalith is present for this reason. Our study seeks to uncover whether prevalence of appendicoliths changes from early childhood to adulthood. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We retrospectively reviewed charts of all patients who underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis at Metropolitan Hospital Center between January 2010 to December 2019. We separated the patients into pediatric (&lt;19) and Adult (&ge; 19). We further sub-stratified our pediatric cohort into preschoolers (ages 1-4), elementary schoolers (5-12) and teenagers (13-18). The presence of appendicoliths was identified with pathology report. We also investigated our negative appendectomy rate for all comers. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Out of 855 patients who underwent an appendectomy for appendicitis, 23.5 % (201/855) were identified as pediatric, 1.63% (14/855) were preschoolers, 12.5% (107/855) elementary schoolers and 9.4% (80/855) teenagers. Our adult population comprised the remaining 76.5% (654/855). The prevalence of appendicoliths for each group was calculated; 64.3% (9/14) for preschoolers; 32.7% (35/107) for elementary schoolers, 26% (21/80) teenagers and 18.65% (122/654) for adults. The overall negative appendectomy rate was 3% over the past 20 years. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
A clear pattern of diminishing prevalence of appendicoliths with increasing age emerged. This is in contradistinction to the long-held view that appendicoliths are the primary etiology of adult appendicitis while lymphoid hyperplasia was the main cause in children. It affirms an observation made in a previous study from our institution, and additionally, is the first study to demonstrate that prevalence of appendicoliths in acute appendicitis is highest in toddlers and gradually diminishes with age. As such, these results beg a follow-up question: During the COVID pandemic with nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis gaining popularity for adults, is it a viable option for pediatric cases as well? While non operative management may be a viable option for teenagers who essentially behave like adults and have a lower appendicolith incidence, for younger children with higher appendicolith rates and less reliable imaging, surgery likely remains the safest option.

Objectives: Determine patient and provider perspectives to widespread rapid telemedicine implementation, understand the key components of a surgical telemedicine visit and identify factors that affect future telemedicine use.

 

Summary of Background Data: Compared to other specialties, the field of surgery heretofore has had limited adoption of telemedicine. During the COVID-19 pandemic Healthcare, including surgical specialties, saw new widespread use of telemedicine.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a prospective cohort study during the COVID-19 California stay-at-home and physical distancing executive orders. Utilization data was collected from clinics and compared to usage data during the same time one year later. All patients and providers who participated in a telemedicine visit during the study period were asked to complete a survey after each encounter and the surveys were analyzed for trends in opinions on future use by stakeholders.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over the 10-week period, the median percentage of telemedicine visits per clinic was 33% (17-51%) which peaked 3 weeks into implementation. One hundred and ninety-one patients (48% women) with a median age of 64 years (IQR 53-73) completed the patient survey. Patients were first-time participants in telemedicine in 41% of visits. Fifty-seven percent of first-time users preferred that future visits be in-person vs. 31% of prior users (p=0.007). The median travel time from home to the clinic was 40 minutes (IQR = 20-90). Patients with longer travel times were not more likely to use telemedicine in the future (61% with longer travel vs. 53% shorter, p =0.11). From the 148 provider responses, 90% of the time providers were able to create a definitive plan with the telemedicine visit. A physical exam was determined not to be needed in 45% of the visits. An attempt at any physical exam was not performed in 84% of routine follow-up or new-patient visits, compared to 53% of post-op visits (p=0.001).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Telemedicine is a viable ambulatory visit option for surgical specialists and their patients. During rapid telemedicine deployment, distance to travel distance did not correlate with increased use of telemedicine, and in-person visits are still preferred. However, nearly half of all visits did not need a physical exam, which favors telemedicine use.

Increasingly payers are focused on addressing social determinants of health and their impact on post-operative outcomes. While consideration of payment models that account for social risk has increased, little is known about how specific social risk factors, such as neighborhood disadvantage, may effect on healthcare expenditures for surgical procedures.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We examined 37, 634 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing appendectomy, cholecystectomy, colectomy and hernia repair between January 2014 and December 2018. Beneficiaries were stratified into quintiles based on their neighborhood Area Deprivation Index score, a composite measure at the census tract level of neighborhood disadvantage. We evaluated risk-adjusted, price standardized Medicare payments for the 30-day total episode of surgical care that included spending for index hospitalization, physician services, re-admissions and post-discharge ancillary care.

Medicare beneficiaries in the most deprived neighborhoods had higher total 30-day episode spending compared to those in the least deprived neighborhoods ($30,851 vs $28, 807; abs difference $2,044, P&lt;0.001). The difference in payments between beneficiaries in most and least deprived neighborhoods was due to higher overall payments for the index hospitalization ($21,291 vs. $20,001; abs difference $1290; P &lt;0.001, readmissions ($1,736, vs. $1,587 abs difference $149; P&lt;0.001) and post-discharge ancillary care ($3,960 vs $3,555 abs difference $405; P&lt;0.001). These differences were driven in part by higher rates of readmissions (12.9% vs 10.8%) and post-acute care (67.8% vs. 61.2%) among beneficiaries living in the most deprived neighborhoods compared to the least deprived.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Higher neighborhood deprivation was associated with higher spending among Medicare beneficiaries following common general surgery procedures particularly due to more spending on the index hospitalization, re-admissions and post-discharge care services. These findings suggest that payment models focused on socially at-risk populations, as done for medical conditions, or inclusion of social risk in value based payment models may be appropriate for surgical cohorts.

Minimally invasive approaches to intra-abdominal surgeries are associated with improved safety, shorter hospitalizations, and fewer postoperative complications. This study aims to determine if there exists a racial disparity in postoperative complications following Roux en Y gastric bypass (RenYGB) and, if so, evaluate the mediating effect of access to a minimally invasive approach.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

After acquiring IRB-approval, patients in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database who underwent RenYGB between 2012 and 2019 were identified. Patient demographics included: self-reported race, sex, clinical, operative and postoperative variables were recorded. A 4:1 propensity score matching algorithm was generated to enable analysis of the mediating effect of open approach to surgery on the relationship between self-reported race and postoperative complications.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 48,724 cases of RenYGB were isolated; 40,698 patients self-identified as white and 8,026 self-identified as black. Logistic regressions indicated that self-identified black individuals had increased odds of receiving an open approach to RenYGB (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.40-1.84; p&lt;0.001) and were significantly more likely to experience any postoperative complication (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.20-1.42; p&lt;0.001), minor complications (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.24-1.52; p&lt;0.001), severe complications (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.01-1.27; p=0.0305), and unplanned readmission (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.24-1.52; p&lt;0.001). Finally, reduced access to a minimally invasive approach to surgery was found to be a significant mediator of the independent association between black self-identified race and increased odds of any complication (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.19-1.41; p&lt;0.001), minor complications (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.24-1.51; p&lt;0.001), severe complications (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.0-1.26; p=0.0449) and unplanned readmission (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.24-1.52; p&lt;0.001). Logistic regression analysis that identifies the direct effect and total effect of self-identified black individuals on post-operative complications is represented via box and whisker plots of odds ratios (dots) and 95% confidence intervals (lines) (supporting graphic).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The present study found that patients of black self-identified race have increased odds of experiencing postoperative complications relative to their counterparts of white self-identified race, and that this association is mediated by reduced access to a minimally invasive approach to surgery. Further studies are required to elucidate the socioeconomic variations that contribute to such disparities.

Currently, racial disparities surrounding this operation have not been well characterized. The aim of the present study was to analyze the association between patient race on operative approach and postoperative complications and determine if racial disparities in access to minimally invasive approach mediate racial disparities in postoperative complications.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All cases of gastric sleeve recorded in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database from 2012-19 were collected. Patient demographic, preoperative, operative, and postoperative variables were recorded. A 4:1 greedy-matching propensity score algorithm was implemented to generate clinically balanced cohorts of patients of white and black self-identified race. These cohorts were then subjected to logistic regressions to evaluate the effect of race on operative approach (direct effect), the effect of race on postoperative complications, and the mediating effect of operative approach on the incidence of postoperative complications (total effect).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Query of the ACS-NSQIP database yielded 79,087 cases of sleeve gastrectomy. Propensity score matching yielded cohorts of 12,221 and 727 patients of white and black self-identified race, respectively. Logistic regressions revealed that patients of black self-identified race were less likely to receive an open approach (OR=0.490, 95% CI=0.332-0.697, p&lt;0.001) but were more likely to face any complication, minor complications, severe complications, and unplanned readmissions (any: OR=1.488, 95% CI=1.371-1.613, p&lt;0.001; minor: OR=1.665, 95% CI=1.513-1.830, p&lt;0.001; severe: OR=1.146, 95% CI=1.015-1.290, p=0.026; readmission: OR=1.670, 95% CI=1.518-1.835, p&lt;0.001). Operative approach did not mediate the association between black race and postoperative complications (any: OR=1.495, 95% CI=1.378-1.621, p&lt;0.001; minor: OR=1.669, 95% CI=1.517-1.834, p&lt;0.001; severe: OR=1.154, 95% CI=1.023-1.300, p=0.019; readmission: OR=1.673, 95% CI=1.521-1.839, p&lt;0.001). The supporting graphic provides box and whisker plots of odds ratios (dots) and 95% confidence intervals (lines) calculated via logistic regression analysis evaluating the direct effect and total effect of black self-identified race on postoperative complications.

Collins<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Department Of Surgery, Columbus, OH, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Weill Cornell Medicine, Department Of Population Health Sciences, New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with a variety of poor surgical outcomes. However, SES can be difficult to assess at the individual patient level. Community distress by zip code has been evaluated in other patient populations as a surrogate for SES. This unique Distressed Communities Index (DCI) variable, derived by zip code across the United States, provides a comprehensive view of the social and neighborhood factors that affect patient outcomes. However, this has not been studied in the ventral hernia repair (VHR) population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All patients aged 18 or older who underwent VHR in the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative (ACHQC) database were linked to the Distressed Communities Index (DCI), which uses 7 measures of economic and social stress to assign zip codes a score from 0-100. DCI was measured for each patient and stratified into quintiles: prosperous (1), comfortable (2), mid-tier (3), at risk (4), and distressed (5). Patients were further stratified by complexity, where complex cases were defined as having either myofascial release or hernia width &gt; 10cm. Pearson&rsquo;s chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for univariate comparisons of categorical and continuous demographic and clinical characteristics, respectively, for both complex and non-complex groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The study included 33309 patients, of which 21271 (63.9%) were non-complex and 12038 (36.1%) were complex. Non-complex cases included 6893 prosperous, 4836 comfortable, 3524 mid-tier, 3034 at risk, and 2984 distressed. Patients in the lowest DCI quintile were younger, had a greater proportion of females and racial minorities, greater ASA class, and the highest rates of comorbidities (p&lt;0.01). Emergent repair was significantly higher among patients from the most distressed communities (prosperous: 2.9%, comfortable: 3.02%, mid-tier: 3.38%, at risk: 3.33%, distressed: 4.93%; p&lt;0.01). Hernia width also increased with greater community distress (p&lt;0.01). Similar distributions and findings occurred in the complex group, with emergent presentation significantly more common among those from most distressed areas (prosperous: 2.05%, comfortable: 2.41%, mid-tier: 1.73%, at risk: 2.31%, distressed: 3.45%; p=0.003).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Patients from the most distressed communities undergo emergent repair at a greater rate compared to patients of higher socioeconomic status. These findings provide preliminary evidence that external community factors may affect hernia presentation and play a role in disease management, especially in complex conditions such as VHR. Greater consideration should be given to public health as it is intricately interwoven into patients lived experiences which can directly impact health and wellness.

Falls are increasingly common in the elderly and are often associated with long-term clinical sequela and poor quality of life. Previous studies have reported on the correlation between hospital safety-net status (SNH) and inferior outcomes. The present study aimed to evaluate the association of SNH status with in-hospital mortality and readmissions following ground-level falls (GLF).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All geriatric (&gt;65 years) patients non-electively admitted for mechanical GLF were queried using the 2016-2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Concomitant injuries and surgical interventions during index hospitalization were extracted using International Classification of Diseases 10<sup>th</sup> Revisions codes. Predicted likelihood of mortality was quantified using the Trauma Mortality Prediction Model (TMPM). Safety-net hospitals were defined as centers in the highest quartile of annual hospital volume of Medicaid and uninsured patients and the remaining centers were considered non-SNH. Patients who were transferred as well as those who had additional indications of penetrating or blunt trauma were excluded. Multivariable regressions were used to assess factors associated with increased in-hospital mortality, index-hospitalization costs, and 30-day non-elective readmissions. Complications including venous thromboembolism (VTE), respiratory, acute kidney injury, cardiac, and infectious were also evaluated.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 1,660,099 patients admitted for GLF, 342,439 (20.6%) were admitted to SNH hospitals. Compared to others, patients treated at SNH centers were less commonly female (64.5% vs 65.9) and were admitted with fewer long bone fractures (37.4% vs 39.4 p&lt;0.001 for both). Patients treated at SNH and non-SNH had similar TMPM scores as well as comparable rates of gastrointestinal, thoracic, and vascular operations (P&gt;0.05 for all). After adjustment, patients treated at SNH centers had increased odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.35 95% CI 1.28-1.42) and overall rates of complications (AOR: 1.06 95% CI 1.04-1.09). Patients admitted to SNH following ground-level falls also had increased adjusted hospitalization costs (&beta; +$17,000, 95% CI +16,900-+17,100). Furthermore, SNH status was independently associated with an increased likelihood of 30-day readmissions as well as respiratory, cardiac, VTE, and infectious complications (Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Traumatic ground-level falls incur high rates of morbidity and mortality among the elderly. Our study found high-burden safety net hospitals to be associated with an increased likelihood of mortality and complications. Further studies may help discern barriers in access to equitable care for such high-risk populations.

Cohen<sup>1</sup>, D. Telem<sup>1</sup>, G. Wakam<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed the widespread uptake of telehealth services across the US. However, the sustainability of these efforts, especially in the perioperative space, hinders on the patient acceptance of a virtual modality for healthcare appointments, which is currently unclear. At this time, it is not understood if surgical patients view virtual visits as fully sufficient or inadequate for care delivery, the latter of which could introduce redundant healthcare utilization in the form of additional pre- or post-operative visits. In this context, we aim to understand if virtual visits in the perioperative space affect resource utilization and institutional efficiency.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective analysis of all completed pre- and post-operative visits at a large academic medical center was utilized to compare resource utilization in a pre-pandemic period (July 1 2019 &ndash; Jan 15 2020) to a late-pandemic period (July 1 2020 &ndash; Jan 15 2021). The pre-pandemic cohort provided a patient behavior baseline, and the late pandemic cohort, which captures a period after the acute pandemic healthcare affects had resolved, provided a comparison to a new workflow where patients had an option to book either virtual or in-person visits. Additional visits were used as a proxy for increased resource utilization and defined as the occurrence of a second in-person visit after a primary clinic visit, either in-person or virtual, was already completed. Additional visits after both in-person and virtual first appointments were compared in the pre- and late-pandemic periods.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In the pre-pandemic period, 4243 patients were seen for preoperative appointments and 2866 patients were seen for postoperative appointments. Among the 2014 late-pandemic preoperative appointments, 55 (2.7%) where conducted virtually and among the 2879 late-pandemic postoperative appointments, 953 (47.3%) were conducted virtually. In the pre-pandemic baseline period, 25% of patients required additional visits after an initial preoperative appointment. In the late-pandemic period, additional preoperative appointments decreased after both initial in-person (9%) and virtual (20%) visits. The use of virtual visits in the late-pandemic period significantly decreased the need for additional postoperative visits, compared to the pre-pandemic period (5% vs 32%). There was no change for the number of additional visits required after pre-pandemic initial appointments to late pandemic initial in-person appointments (32% vs 32%). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results indicate that the use of virtual visits decreased the need for additional postoperative visits. Specifically, postoperative virtual visits may be of higher value compared to the preoperative period. Overall, patients trust and accept virtual care in the perioperative setting. Future research will further evaluate the optimal patient population and surgical specialty for use of virtual perioperative appointments.

Furthermore, accurate prediction of perioperative risk is essential to thorough patient counseling. Multiple risk score systems have been proposed to address this challenge, yet the optimal risk index remains unknown. In this study, we sought to compare three previously validated perioperative risk scoring systems following pancreatectomy to determine if one should represent a gold standard model to be used in the preoperative evaluation of prospective patients undergoing pancreatectomy. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The 2014-2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried for all patients undergoing pancreatectomy. Three models were evaluated: (1) NSQIP Universal Risk Calculator (URC), (2) Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and (3) Modified Frailty Index-5 Factor (MFI-5). Primary outcomes included composite serious complications, individual serious complications, readmission and 30-day mortality. Predicted and actual outcomes were compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and Brier scores. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 22,123 patients undergoing pancreatectomy were identified. Composite serious complications occurred in 6,020 cases (27.2%). The 30-day mortality rate was 1.4% (n=319). The indices were compared for predicting serious complications and mortality. The AUC for serious complications were 0.59 for the URC, 0.53 for the MELD score, and 0.53 for the mFI-5 index. The AUC for 30-day mortality was 0.70 for the URC, 0.63 for the MELD score, and 0.60 for the mFI-5. Brier scores for serious complications were 0.193 for the URC, 0.200 for the MELD score, and 0.197 for the mFI-5 index. The Brier scores for 30-day mortality were 0.014 for the URC, 0.014 for the MELD score and 0.014 for the mFI-5 index. When examining individual complications, the URC scored higher for the prediction of all individual complications compared to both MELD and mFI-5. However, despite having higher scores than the other two indices, none of the indices achieved an AUC over 0.8.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Of the previously validated perioperative risk scoring systems compared in this study, the NSQIP Universal Risk Calculator was the most predictive of the three for both serious complications and 30-day mortality. However, none of the indices performed better than fair to good. The lack of predictive accuracy of currently existing models highlights the need for development of improved perioperative risk models.

Correlation between volume and quality for pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is well established for surgeons and institutions. The purpose of this study is to define the relative impact of institutional maturation on quality metrics for inexperienced surgeons undertaking PD.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
10 quality metrics were extracted from a prospective database of 400 patients undergoing PD by 6 surgeons between 2008-2021 in a new pancreatic surgery program. Quality outcomes from early (first 30) and late experience (last 30) were compared for both the institution and 3 inexperienced surgeons who joined a mature institution (&gt;30 PD / year). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for each outcome to quantify the variability explained by surgeon and institution experience to further assess observed significant improvements (0-50 % low; 51-69 % moderate; &gt;70 % high).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Significant quality improvement occurred in 7 of 10 metrics as the institution matured (fistula rate unchanged/not shown). There was high correlation to institutional experience in pathology dependent outcomes and moderate correlation with mortality and operative time. Except for node harvest, quality for inexperienced surgeons started and remained high assimilating that of the mature institution from day one (all ICC &lt;50). [Table] Experienced surgeons assisted inexperienced surgeons for part or all PD in 36% first and 30% of last cases.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
With respect to quality, the institutional learning curve for PD is steep; once navigated, a mature institution flattens the learning curve for new surgeons. Access to and engagement of experienced surgeons may also explain initial and sustained quality outcomes for young faculty.

Perioperative malnutrition is associated with adverse postoperative outcomes. Recently, the Perioperative Quality Initiative recommended the use of the Peri-Operative Nutrition Screen (PONS) as a tool to assess malnutrition in patients planning to undergo major surgery. We hypothesized that patients with a positive PONS (malnourished) who undergo pancreatic resection for malignancy have worse short-term surgical outcomes than those with a negative PONS (non-malnourished), making the PONS a useful screen for risk-stratification and preoperative counseling. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a 3-year analysis of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Participant Use Data File to identify all patients undergoing pancreatic resection for malignancy from 2015-2017. PONS defines malnutrition as BMI &lt;18.5 (&lt;20 if age &gt;65), weight loss &gt;10% of body weight in the last 6 months, eating &lt;50% of normal diet, or albumin &lt;3.0. The PONS was applied to NSQIP patients using variables (albumin level, BMI, weight loss &gt;10 % body weight in the past 6 months). PONS screen was classified as positive (malnourished) or negative. Short-term outcomes measured included minor and major morbidity as defined by the Clavien-Dindo classification (I/II vs III/IV), 30-day mortality, need for readmission, unfavorable discharge (defined as not to home), hospital length of stay (LOS), and pancreatic fistula. Propensity score-matched analysis was performed between the two groups. Analysis was stratified in pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and distal pancreatectomy (DP) groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 12,418 patients underwent pancreatectomy between 2015-2017. In the PD group, 1282 malnourished patients were matched to 1282 non-malnourished patients. Patients with a positive PONS were more likely to have longer LOS (10.48&plusmn;6.33 vs 9.97&plusmn;6.63 days; p &lt;0.010), unfavorable discharge (15.68 % vs 11.86 %; p&lt; 0.01), receive perioperative blood transfusion (23.71 % vs 17.00 %; p&lt;0.0001), and experience septic shock in the postoperative period (2.11% vs 0.78%; p&lt;0.01) than those with a negative screen. In the DP 265 malnourished patients were compared to 265 non-malnourished patients. Although the same trends existed in LOS (8.06&plusmn;5.54 vs 7.17&plusmn;4.66 days; p=0.04) unfavorable discharge (15.09 %vs 8.68%; p=0.02), perioperative blood transfusions (23.40% vs 18.87%; p=0.21), and septic shock (1.51% vs 1.13%; p=1.00), they did not reach statistical significance.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The PONS is a simple screen to assess nutritional status prior to major pancreatic surgery. It can be used for risk-stratification and can help guide discussion and set expectations during the preoperative visit regarding LOS, complications, and unfavorable discharge. It can also be used to initiate formal nutrition assessment and intervention by clinical dietitians preoperatively, consider the use of early nutrition with feeding tubes postoperatively, preoperative immune-nutrition, and avoidance of preoperative fasting in patients who have a positive PONS.

We sought to explore the impact of age and BMI in determining outcomes of PD. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The ACS-NSQIP pancreatectomy targeted file was used to identify PDs from 2014-2019. Patients were stratified into eight different categories according to a compound age-BMI variable and risk-adjusted. Age of 65 years was set for young vs elderly. Obesity was classified as class I (BMI 30-35), class II (BMI 35-40), and class III (BMI &gt;40). Young-normal/overweight-(BMI&lt;30) was considered as the reference group. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Young-obese class I (OR 1.23, p = 0.003), young-obese class III (OR 1.54, p = 0.03), and elderly-obese class II (OR 1.51, p-value = 0.003) had statistically significant higher odds of morbidity/mortality.

Distal pancreatectomy (DP) and splenectomy with en bloc celiac axis resection (CAR), or modified Appleby procedure, is rarely performed but is feasible in appropriately selected patients. Herein, we report our institutional experience from 2014-2020 to assess perioperative and oncologic outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 16 consecutive patients, identified by our Institutional Review Board-approved database, who underwent en bloc DP-CAR for biopsy-confirmed LAPC. Demographics, perioperative factors, tumor / treatment related variables, and survival were recorded and analyzed. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier actuarial method.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our study group consists of 9 male and 7 female evaluable patients with a median age of 66 years (range, 56-75 years). Median postoperative follow-up was 19.2 months. Prior to en-bloc DP-CAR for LAPC, 15 patients (94%) received modern long course combinatorial neo-adjuvant therapy, which consisted frequently of FOLFIRINOX (63%) and radiotherapy (50%). Determinants for neoadjuvant therapy response included established radiographic RECIST response and serum pre- and post-treatment confirmed CA19-9 levels (Pretreatment: median 283 U/mL; range 1-10,334 U/mL / Post-treatment: median 64 U/mL; range- 1-306 U/mL; P &lt; 0.001). R0 resection was achieved in 14 patients (87.5%). In fourteen patients, adequate arterial collaterals necessitated only resection and ligation of the distal common hepatic artery (CHA). Two patients required aorto-CHA and distal CHA to left gastric artery bypasses, respectively, to ensure adequate hepatic perfusion. The median operative time and EBL were 390 min (range, 368- 456 min) and 425 mL (range, 263- 900 ml), respectively. Postoperatively, the median length of stay was 5 days (range, 4-9 days) per our accelerated pancreatectomy recovery pathway. Overall, nine patients (56%) developed complications during the 30-day postoperative period which included no occurrences of liver ischemia and no surgery associated mortalities. The median survival after resection was 34.9 months. (Figure 1). The 1- and 3-year survival rates were 75% and 19%, respectively. Remarkably, amongst this study group, survivorship included 5 and 7-year patient survivors.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our modern institutional experience demonstrates that en bloc DP-CAR, although rarely performed, can be a safe and potentially effective treatment option for appropriately selected patients with LAPC.

Understanding the role of CD8+ cells in the immune response against cancer can contribute to an accurate prognosis and a more successful choice of treatment. This study aims to compare the number of CD8+ lymphocytes between HCV-related vs. non-HCV hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to explore possible associations of CD8+ cell counts with surgical, laboratory, and pathological findings.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: CD8+ lymphocytes in a test cohort were visualized by means of immunohistochemistry on HCV-related HCC, non-HCV HCC, and control non-neoplastic liver formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. CD8+ cells were manually counted at high magnification (400&times;) in three hot-spots in each of the areas: core tumor center, invasive margin, and surrounding liver tissue.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 62 HCC and 10 control samples were selected from patients who underwent liver resection or transplantation at Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos between January 2009 and September 2020. Most of the patients (60%) were males and the median age at the time of operation was 61 years old. 49/62 (79%) HCC samples were associated with HCV infection. There was no significant difference in CD8+ lymphocytes count in the tumor center (HCV-related HCC vs. non-HCV HCC p&lt;0.659), at the invasive margin (HCV-related HCC vs. non-HCV HCC p=1), in surrounding parenchyma (HCV-related HCC vs. non-HCV HCC p&lt;0.180). However, there was a statistical difference between the groups in METAVIR score (HCV-related HCC vs. non-HCV HCC p&lt;0.002) and Ishak score (HCV-related HCC vs. non-HCV HCC p&lt;0.003), most of the cases got a higher score in the HCV-reladed HCC group in both scoring systems. In surrounding parenchyma, higher numbers of CD8+ lymphocytes were associated with elevated ALT (p&lt;0.036), normal total bilirubin before surgery (p&lt;0.001), resection type of surgery (p&lt;0.012) groups in normal parenchyma; in the invasive margin, with elevated ALT (p&lt;0.044) and AFP (p&lt;0.011) before surgery. The quantity of CD8-positive cells in the center of the tumor strongly correlated with CD8+ cells in the invasive margin (r = 0.861, p&lt;0.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There was no significant association between the number of CD8-positive lymphocytes in different tissue compartments and other pathological findings or viral status of HCC. Numbers of CD8+ cells correlated in the tumor center and invasive margin compartments and were associated with laboratory values before surgery and resection type of liver surgery. The more advanced approach using digital microscopy image analytics will be further applied to generate comprehensive liver tissue microenvironment indicators of local interactions of cancer and immune cells based on CD8 and other IHC biomarker expression on lymphocytes and various tissue compartments.

Consequently, prevalence, risk factors, and prognosis are not well known. We reviewed our institution&rsquo;s experience and published literature to further characterize the scope of this phenomenon.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All pancreatectomy cases (556 patients) performed at a tertiary care center between 2010-2020 were reviewed to identify IPMN diagnoses. Patients with adenocarcinoma not arising from IPMN, or a history of other malignancies were excluded. We also queried PUBMED for literature published up to October 2019, finding 30 articles in English reporting patients with PMs following surgical resection for IPMN. Study location and design, patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and clinical outcomes were abstracted.
 
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 78 patients underwent pancreatectomy with IPMN on final pathology at our institution; 51 met inclusion criteria. Of these, there were 5 cases of PMs. Four had invasive carcinoma arising from IPMN and 1 had high grade dysplasia at the index operation. Median interval from surgery to PMs was 7 months (range: 3-13 months). From our review of published literature, there were 3,580 reported patients undergoing resection for IPMNs in 30 included articles. PMs occurred in 117 (3.3%). Patient demographics/characteristics were inconsistently reported; however, higher numbers of PMs were seen in male patients (18/26), patients &ge; 60 years (19/24), and patients with invasive carcinoma on histology (73/88). Invasive pathology was the only significant association with PM (&chi;2 =38.2, p&lt;0.0001). PMs rates were 0.21% in low to intermediate grade dysplasia IPMN, 1.5% in high grade dysplasia IPMN, and 7.7% in invasive carcinoma arising from IPMN. Median interval from surgery to PMs was 26 months for noninvasive IPMN (range: 7-63 months, n=8), and 12 months for invasive carcinoma arising from IPMN (range: 2.9-31 months; n=16).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: PMs following IPMN resection are rare but may be more common in patients with male sex, age &ge; 60, and those with invasive histology. Although rare, PMs arose in patients with non-invasive IPMNs. Further studies on pathophysiology and risk factors of this entity are needed and may reinforce adherence to guidelines recommending long-term surveillance following IPMN resection.

Estrogen plays an important role in the development of many malignancies. Previous literature has shown that estrogen has a protective effect against the development and progression of colorectal cancer. However, the current data is lacking on the effect of estrogen on colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). This study seeks to explore the prognostic effect of estrogen on patients with CRLM.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients diagnosed with CRLM between 2004 and 2017 were queried from the National Cancer Data Base. Patients with stages I-III of colorectal cancer were excluded. Patients with only liver metastasis were included. We utilized two experiments to study the effect of estrogen on the overall survival (OS) of patients with CRLM. First, we compared female CRLM patients with male CRLM patients (Both cohorts younger than 50 years old). Second, we compared female CRLM patients 50 years or older with female CRLM patients younger than 50 years old. Based on previous epidemiologic studies, we used the 50 years cut off as a proxy for menopausal status (&lt;50=premenopausal, &ge;50= postmenopausal). We assumed that in female patients above 50 years old, estrogen had minimal or no effect.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 29,818 patients with CRLM were identified including 3,776 males younger than 50 years old, 3,399 females younger than 50 years old, and 22,643 females 50 years or older. When comparing both females and males younger than 50, the average age of both cohorts was 44. Males had on average a larger sized tumor and higher number of positive regional lymph nodes when compared to their female counterparts. After controlling for all risk-competing factors, larger sized tumors, the presence of positive regional lymph nodes, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion were all associated with worse OS (P&lt;0.05). Overall, female patients with CRLM had a longer median survival (23.7 months) compared with male patients with CRLM (22.7 months) (P=0.004) (Figure 1). On the other hand, when comparing females younger than 50 years with females 50 years or older, there were no differences in tumor size or presence of positive regional lymph nodes. Younger patients had a higher percentage of healthier patients. After controlling for other clinically relevant factors, the presence of lymphovascular invasion and positive regional lymph nodes were both associated with worse OS. Overall, females younger than 50 years had a longer median survival (23.7 months) when compared with females 50 years or older (9.9 months) (P&lt;0.001) (Figure 2).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study shows that among patients with CRLM, females younger than 50 years old have a better survival than females 50 years or older, and when comparing both females and males younger than 50, females had a better overall survival. These results show that estrogen may be potentially exerting a protective effect on patients diagnosed with CRLM. Future studies at the cellular level must be performed to further investigate this protective influence.

Herremans<sup>1</sup>, D. D. Szymkiewicz<sup>1</sup>, S. J. Hughes<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Florida, Department Of Surgery, Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Decisions to pursue a tissue diagnosis when pancreatic cancer is suspected are impacted by resectability, clinical trial consideration, and/or patient/provider preference. Unfortunately, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) - guided fine needle aspiration and even core biopsy lack a high degree of accuracy, leading to additional attempts at biopsy. We explored the impact of pursuing a tissue diagnosis on days to treatment, hypothesizing that attempt at biopsy delays treatment.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This was a retrospective review of 131 Resectable and 58 Borderline Resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients that ultimately underwent surgery with curative intent at a tertiary care center from 2011-2021. Dates of diagnostic milestones (cancer suspected, biopsy(ies), and surgical or neo-adjuvant treatment initiation) were collected. Number of biopsies and time between milestones were analyzed with two-sample Wilcoxon and Chi-square tests. Linear Regression and Cox Proportional Hazard Models were used to further analyze time from clinical suspicion to treatment.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Patients in the Borderline Resectable group underwent more biopsy attempts than those in the Resectable group (1.2 vs 0.7, p&lt;0.0001) and had a trend of more days from suspicion to treatment initiation (49.3 vs 43.9 days, p=0.0695). The average time between biopsies ranged 17.75 to 25.69 days. In the multivariate analysis, there was no longer a difference in time to treatment initiation between groups (2.6 days, p=0.5577; HR 1.05, p=0.7989). Time from suspicion to treatment became significantly longer with each additional biopsy (additional 16.53, 37.81, and 59.21 days for 1, 2, and 3 biopsies respectively, all p&rsquo;s&lt;0.001). Race and insurance status both had significant effects. Black patients and Medicare patients waited 25.74 (p=0.0004) and 19.22 (p=0.0464) more days than White and Medicaid patients, respectively. Further, Black and Medicare patients were less than half as likely to begin treatment with each additional day compared to White and Medicaid patients (HR=0.47, p=0.0074; HR=0.44, p=0.0339).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Biopsy attempts added 2-8 weeks of time between suspicion of cancer and treatment initiation, regardless of tumor resectability. Though tissue diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy is informative, the time cost of attempts should be carefully considered. This study also revealed that demographic and socioeconomic factors impact delays to treatment.

We aim to assess the value of service line cholecystectomy at our Health Network by interrogating surrogate domains of quality and cost.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: On index admission clinical variables (v=81) from patients (&gt;18yo) who underwent cholecystectomy were retrieved from a Health Network warehouse retrospectively (Jan-2010 to July-2016), and prospectively (Aug-2016 to Dec-2020) under IRB-approved protocols. While quality (Obs./Exp.) domains included post-operative complications (PC, grading system), length of stay (LOS in days), readmission rate for 30 days post-discharge (RA), patient satisfaction (PS), and textbook cases (TB), cost domains included total charges submitted for admission and readmission (TC), and reimbursement index (RI, O/E). Uni/multivariate analyses and modeling were performed using MATLAB r2020b and SPSS.

Socioeconomic factors are known to significantly impact treatment outcomes in patients undergoing colorectal, bariatric, breast, and pancreatic operations. Data regarding the impact of health insurance status on patients undergoing hepatectomy is very limited, especially when undertaken robotically. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of health insurance status on intra- and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing robotic hepatectomy. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
With IRB approval, we prospectively followed 275 patients who underwent da Vinci Xi robotic hepatectomy. Patients were stratified by their health insurance status (i.e., private, Medicare, or Medicaid/uninsured). To eliminate confounding variables, 16 patients in each cohort were propensity-score matched by IWATE score (&plusmn;1) and age (&plusmn;5 years). Statistical significance was accepted at a p-value &le;0.05. The data are presented as median (mean&plusmn;SD).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
44% patients had private insurance, 44% had Medicare, and 12% had Medicaid/uninsured. Before propensity-score matching, age [63(62&plusmn;14) years, p=0.01], sex [151 women, p=0.003], ASA class [3(3&plusmn;1), p=0.01], MELD score [7(9&plusmn;3), p=0.03], and length of stay [4(4&plusmn;3) days, p=0.01] were statistically different when stratified by health insurance status using ANOVA of repeated measure; however, the level of technical complexity, (i.e., IWATE score), tumor size, EBL, the frequency/severity of complications, in-hospital mortality, and readmission rates were similar. Following propensity-score matching, no statistical differences were found in the pre-, intra-, and perioperative variables (Table). There were no conversions to &lsquo;open&rsquo; and no intraoperative complications.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In our hepatobiliary program, health insurance status does not predict operative complexity or perioperative outcomes after robotic hepatectomy using propensity-score matched methodology.

SURPAS is currently used in the electronic health record system at the University of Colorado Health (UCHealth), but is not available elsewhere. The purpose of this study was to develop a mobile application of SURPAS that could be used outside of the UCHealth System at no cost to the user.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The development of SURPAS used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database of over 6 million operations from over 700 participating hospitals in 9 surgical specialties, and its validity and performance characteristics have been published in multiple articles.The SURPAS mobile application was built using the Shiny package in the R programming language. The risk for each outcome is calculated by the logistic regression equations of the SURPAS models; the user input values are paired with beta coefficients of the models to produce the output risks. The mobile application is hosted by Shinyapps.io, an online service for hosting Shiny apps in the cloud.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In the development of SURPAS, it was found that 8 predictor variables (4 related to the operation--CPT-specific event rate, work RVU, surgeon specialty, inpatient/outpatient setting, and 4 related to the patient--age, ASA class, functional health status, and emergency) were the most important predictors in models across all 12 outcomes (mortality, overall morbidity, readmission, discharge not home, cardiac, pulmonary, infection, bleeding, UTI, VTE, renal, and stroke) with c-indices ranging from 0.931 for mortality to 0.724 for readmission. The user can access the app via a web browser, enter the 8 predictor variables for a given patient, and receive the individualized patient risks for the 12 outcomes, compared to national average risks for patients undergoing the same operation, as calculated from the ACS-NSQIP database (see Figure). A CPT search engine stratified by specialty helps the user find the correct CPT code for the operation. Once CPT code is identified, a table look-up gives values for the CPT-specific event rate and work RVU variables. Dropdown menus are used to input most of the other variables. A printed handout can also be produced for the patient to take home.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A SURPAS mobile application has been developed that can be used by interested providers at no cost inside or outside of the UCHealth system,

Telemedicine (TM) is designed to increase healthcare access and increasingly used during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its effect on surgical outcomes is not yet known. We aimed to characterize peri-operative telemedicine use and determine if it was associated with post-operative outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Outpatient surgical visits at a single center were reviewed from 1/1-9/30/2020 (TM visits began 3/17/2020). These data were cross-referenced with institutional ACS-NSQIP data. Visits closest to surgery within 60 days counted as pre- and post-operative visits. Patients were stratified by clinic visit type: In person (IP) pre- and post-op (IPIP), IP pre-op and TM post-op (IPTM), TM pre-op and IP post-op (TMIP), and TM pre- and post-op (TMTM). Cohorts were compared by patient and peri-operative factors. Primary outcome was post-op length of stay (pLOS). Secondary outcomes were post-op surgical site infection (SSI) and 30-day readmissions (30DR). Chi-square, ANOVA, and multivariable regression were performed to compare patient groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 1,273 surgical encounters, 75.3% were IPIP, 14.2% IPTM, 5.3 TMTM, and 5.2% TMIP. The cohort was 70% white and 28% Black. TMTM had the greatest fraction of white patients (81.8%) and TMIP the greatest fraction of Black patients (38.2%, p=0.03). Most surgeries were inpatient (65.5%), with most among IPIP (67.8% inpatient) and least among TMTM (54.5% inpatient, p=0.03). Most surgeries were with General Surgery (47%), with variations in TM usage by specialty (p&lt;0.001). There were no differences in sex, BMI, elective surgery, insurance, clinic visit timing, Social Vulnerability Index, median income of home ZIP, or comorbidities (p&gt;0.05). 

Mean pLOS was 2.9 days with the shortest for TMTM (1.9) and longest for IPIP (3.0, p=0.01). SSI and 30DR rates were 5.2% and 7.8%, respectively without differences between cohorts. On multivariable analysis, all outcomes varied by specialty (p&lt;0.0001). For inpatient surgery (n=731), longer pLOS was associated with emergent surgery (OR: 1.6) and higher ASA (p=0.01), not TM use. SSI was associated with Medicaid insurance (OR: 3.5), higher BMI (OR: 1.03), and lower with outpatient surgery (OR: 0.2). 30DR was lower for outpatient surgery (OR: 0.36), and greater for patients with Medicaid (OR: 2.4). Neither were associated with TM use.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Most peri-operative clinic visits are still IP with varying TM use. TM is currently used safely among healthier patients undergoing elective, outpatient surgeries without increasing post-operative complications. Expanding TM adoption and insurance reimbursement to accommodate patient preferences and resource limitations will allow for increased surgical access to improve quality of care.

Surgical repair of pectus excavatum and carinatum in children is associated with severe postoperative pain and prolonged hospitalization. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a multi-disciplinary, multi-modal approach designed to fast-track surgical care, but due to obstacles to implementation, there are few within pediatric surgery. The aim of this study is to outline the process of development and implementation of an ERAS protocol in pediatric patients with pectus excavatum and carinatum using basics of implementation science.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A multi-disciplinary team of stakeholders was assembled from across five different specialties: anesthesia, nursing, information technology, pediatric surgery, and physical therapy (PT). We worked collaboratively to develop an ERAS protocol for surgical repair of pectus excavatum and carinatum as well as methods for patient and data capture. Champions from each specialty contributed to creation of the protocol to standardize management throughout all phases of care. Once complete, the surgical champion ensured buy-in for the finalized ERAS protocol and broad teaching was completed with all end users (individuals executing the ERAS protocol).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The finalized ERAS protocol was broken down into seven phases of care: preoperative clinic, preoperative day of surgery, intraoperative, post anesthesia care unit, floor, post-discharge, and postoperative clinic. The ERAS protocol was implemented broadly by end users focusing on four main areas: pain control, ambulation, diet, and patient/caregiver education. After implementation, an iterative process identified the following improvements: standardization of preoperative education, stronger collaboration with PT, and involvement of our pharmacist.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Although there are studies highlighting outcomes from ERAS protocols within pediatric surgery, to our knowledge, this is the first study detailing the development and implementation process. Unlike clinical research that often controls for a given context, implementation science focuses on understanding the dynamic context in which the intervention is being introduced. Furthermore, the use of implementation science for this ERAS protocol was key to the identification of barriers and facilitators for project leadership, education dissemination, and patient capture in the pre-implementation, implementation, and post-implementation phases. Moreover, the utilization of an iterative process was important in ensuring ERAS protocol compliance and assessing opportunities for process improvement. The outlined features of implementation science can serve as a model for future ERAS protocols in pediatric surgery across a diverse range of practice settings.

Brat<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Department Of Surgery, Boston, MA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Harvard Medical School, Department Of Biomedical Informatics, Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Preprint server use in medicine has grown exponentially over the past few years, and served as a crucial means of disseminating new knowledge rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic. While several other fields within medicine have rapidly adopted preprints as a means of disseminating research and source of new knowledge, its use for these purposes appears to be comparatively limited in surgery. This new mode of knowledge dissemination has clear advantages and limitations; the field of surgery should consider ways to strategically leverage its benefits. We sought to measure the utilization of preprints in surgery.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A sample of 120 original research articles published between 2019-2021 in the top four surgical journals by impact factor - BJS, JACS, Annals of Surgery, and JAMA Surgery - were randomly selected by a random number generator. All references in these articles were manually reviewed and labeled as either (1) published in a preprint server only, or (2) published in a peer-reviewed journal. We then examined the prevalence of preprint posting on a popular preprint server, medRxiv.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 4,034 references across 120 original scientific peer-reviewed studies were included. Out of 120 papers, only 2 (1.7%) cited at least one preprint manuscript. References to studies published only in preprint servers at the time of citation constituted only 0.0005% of all references. Preprint citations did not increase significantly from 2019 to 2021. This is in contrast to medicine overall, which has seen preprint utilization on non-COVID-19 topics grow by approximately 160% from Jan 2020-Dec 2020 (and grow significantly higher for COVID-19-related research). The only topic on which preprints were cited in our cohort was COVID-19. On the widely-used server medRxiv, surgery is 1 of 51 topics, yet constitutes only 109 (0.005%) of all 23,346 studies published on the server as of Aug 2021.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The meta-science of surgical knowledge dissemination is adapting relatively slowly to new, potentially innovative techniques compared to other fields of medicine. The utilization of preprints in surgery is virtually absent. While preprints have clear limitations, their use should be strategically considered instead of dismissed entirely to take advantage of their strengths while minimizing their risks. The NIH has begun progressively adopting preprints in a multi-year, staged, deliberate manner with interval assessments of benefits and risks; the field of surgery may want to consider a similar strategic model for carefully adopting this new tool of knowledge dissemination.

Brat<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Department Of Surgery, Boston, MA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Harvard Medical School, Department Of Biomedical Informatics, Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Many collaborations across public and private sector institutions formed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic with the goal of rapidly producing high-quality evidence to guide medical decision-making, public health priorities, and more. While multi-institutional research collaborations have existed long before COVID-19, the rapidity and scale at which such collaborations published studies was extremely high in 2020. In this piece, we identify common challenges and successes across two large evidence-generating consortia, and propose a framework to help future collaborations generate high-quality studies in response to pressing research questions.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified two public-private consortia formed during the COVID-19 pandemic whose primary objective was to rapidly generate evidence: (1) the COVID-19 Health Care Coalition (C19HCC), a private-sector led consortium of over 100 members including MITRE, Mayo Clinic, and athenahealth among others, and (2) Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE), a global consortium of dozens of health systems from 11 countries. We conducted interviews with key stakeholders from each group centered around the development of their collaborative organization and execution of their mission.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 5 themes in helping these consortia rapidly generate evidence: governance structure, priority alignment, data sharing, data analysis, and knowledge dissemination. The structure of both organizations was grouped by research question. Priorities were aligned based on early-defined principles and objectives for the consortium. Both adopted a federated approach to rapidly analyzing data at multiple institutions in a standardized fashion. This was done instead of assembling a centralized data repository to enable more rapid analysis and standardization of data definitions. Consistency of analysis was ensured by standardizing data query and analysis code for each research project. 4CE disseminated their work through publications on preprint servers and peer-reviewed journals. C19HCC disseminated their work by leveraging federal agency partnerships to communicate analysis findings directly to policymakers.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Governance structure, alignment of priorities, practices for data sharing and data analysis, and knowledge dissemination strategy should all be considered when forming consortia focused on evidence generation for future public health issues. Real world data is an important resource that can be leveraged during crises to generate insights for public health decisions and policymakers, but there must be efficient organizational structures in place to leverage this data source quickly. Multi-institutional collaborations that are capable of performing rapid analytics to generate public health knowledge pipelines can play an important role in public health; the five dimensions identified in this study should be considered when assembling consortia for future public health issues.

Integration of these guidelines with the electronic health record (EHR) could potentially improve their adoption. Previous projects have shown value with this approach using a default pill count of twelve tablets for all opioid orders, but this is not specific to any surgery and not based on published recommendations. We hypothesize that implementing an EHR order set containing pre-populated pill counts tailored to specific surgical procedures based on the latest published guidelines will decrease overall opioid medications prescribed after surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a pre-post intervention study on adult patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and open or laparoscopic umbilical and inguinal hernia repair at a single tertiary medical center who were also prescribed opioids post-operatively. The pre-intervention group was defined by the March 2019 to December 2019 time period and the post-intervention group was defined by the July 1 to August 15 time period in 2021. Patients who had a postoperative stay greater than 48 hours or underlying chronic pain and taking opioid medication were excluded. An EHR order set was developed with pre-populated opioid pill counts reflecting the upper limit of recommended opioids as published by the Michigan Opioid Prescribing and Engagement Network. Educational material on the order set and prescribing best practices was also disseminated before order set implementation. The primary endpoint was change in morphine milligram equivalent (MME) prescribed postintervention and was analyzed using linear regression adjusting for age, race, procedure, and prescriber level of training. Endpoints of safety were emergency room (ER) visits for pain-related issues and opioid refill rates.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 502 patients (mean age = 50, 63% male) in our baseline cohort and 86 patients (mean age = 52, 51% male) in our post-intervention group. The mean MME prescribed for the pre-intervention group was 121 and 99 for the post-intervention group, and this difference was significant (p = 0.0164). Post-hoc analysis by surgery shows significantly less MME prescribed post intervention for patients who underwent appendectomy (p = 0.037) and hernia repair (p = 0.042) but not for cholecystectomy (p=0.11) as shown in figure attached. There was no difference in the ER visit rate for pain (p = 0.53) and refill rate (p = 0.97) between the pre-intervention and post-intervention group.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: An EHR tailored order set based on prescription guidelines is a safe, effective, and scalable intervention for decreasing opioid prescriptions after surgery.

The objective of this study was to explore the patient-perceived acceptability and perioperative applications of mobile health technology (mHealth).

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was an exploratory qualitative study following the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. Purposive sampling was used to identify patients within 30-90 days following major operations (&ge;10% composite morbidity) across 7 specialties: gynecologic oncology, orthopedics, surgical oncology, vascular, thoracic, burns/plastics, and colorectal surgery. Sekhon&rsquo;s Acceptability Framework informed the development of a semi-structured interview guide and codebook. Phone or video interviews were conducted (May-August 2021) and associated transcripts were de-identified, coded by two team members using an intercoder agreement process, and analyzed deductively by theme, allowing for emergent subthemes.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Twenty-five patients were interviewed prior to achieving saturation. Patients overwhelmingly had a positive affective attitude regarding using mHealth in perioperative processes, with the strongest motivator being surgeon recommendation (Figure 1). Interviewees demonstrated significant intervention coherence, most commonly requesting that mHealth centralize pre- and postoperative discharge instructions, simplify communication channels, and easily share media. Areas of perceived effectiveness of mHealth included improved preoperative expectation management via patient- and disease-specific educational materials, as well as point-of-care preoperative instructions. Postoperatively, interviewees perceived mHealth could reduce in-person encounters (e.g., outpatient clinics, emergency room) and complement telemedicine-based care. Patients also reported that mHealth offered the opportunity to track their physical recovery, which would be motivating when comparing with the progress of other patients. Though the simplicity of sharing media was considered improved with mHealth, most described their current digital patient portal as adequate. Adding mHealth to the perioperative care cycle was perceived as a minimal burden, though there was concern about the frequency of surveys. Few patients were concerned about the ethicality of data collection associated with mHealth, especially if limited to a prespecified time around surgery. While all but one interviewee expressed high self-efficacy when engaging mobile technology, a majority expressed accessibility concerns regarding disadvantaged populations, such as the elderly, cognitively impaired, or those of lower socioeconomic status.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

Patients recovering from major operations representing multiple specialties perceived mHealth to be acceptable and effective for improving perioperative care, especially preoperative education and postoperative communication. These findings have the potential to inform the effective implementation of mHealth to optimize patient-centered surgical care.

Gribovskaja-Rupp<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Iowa, Department Of Surgery, Iowa City, IA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected medical and surgical practice though the full impact on providers and patients is not fully understood, and impact on multi-specialty surgery groups had not be studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the attitudes, perceptions, and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on multi-specialty surgeons and surgical residents and fellows within a tertiary care center.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We surveyed all staff surgeons and surgical trainees within the departments of orthopedics, otolaryngology, surgery, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, urology, obstetrics and gynecology using the Qualtrics platform for distribution, anonymous completion, and data collection. The survey evaluated the pandemic effects on personal health, delivery of patient care, teaching, and research March-December 2020. This project was approved by the institutional review board.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 526 survey recipients, 29.4% (n=155) providers participated. Forty-six percent were women and 57 % trainees. Age was &lt; 44 years in 68.8%, 24.7% had &lt; 10 years in practice, and 89.2% provided direct patient care over 50% of time. Respondent specialties were well-varied: General Surgery and subspecialties 48%, Orthopedic 16%, Obstetrics and Gynecology 11%, Ophthalmology 9.2%, Urology 5.3%, Head and Neck 4.6%, Neurosurgery 1.3%. Ninety percent of respondents reported increased concern for personal health and 52.4% reported they or a close associate were ill with COVID-19. PPE availability was a large concern early in the pandemic. Common negative effects included loneliness due to social isolation (23%) and excessive worry about self or loved ones becoming ill (18%), thoughts of leaving job (8%), and lack of joy in previously satisfying work (11%). Among positive effects of the pandemic were: extra time for self and family care (33%), new initiatives at work (11%), and more meaningful relationships (16%). Respondents believed that COVID-19 affected quality of patient care (71%), and that procedural delay or cancellation affected patient quality of life (95%) and survival (55%). More staff (41%) reported undermined didactic teaching effectiveness than trainees (33%). Telemedicine care was provided by 76% of respondents with 62% of staff comfortable with the modality. However, 30% reported it to be very inferior to face-to-face care.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This is the first study to report effects of COVID-19 pandemic on multi-specialty surgeons at a tertiary, academic center. A large portion of the cohort were women and trainees. Surgeons reported increased rates of loneliness and isolation, but also hopes for the future and new initiatives. Eight percent were considering leaving their jobs. Didactic teaching effectiveness was lower in the eyes of the staff surgeons, but fewer trainees felt it was compromised. The effects of pandemic on multi-specialty surgeons are complex, and while burnout is increased, there are also positive outcomes and initiatives.

Nichol<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin, School Of Medicine And Public Health, Department Of Surgery, Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Operating room (OR) efficiency is a focus of intense study. A major opportunity for efficiency and waste reduction is eliminating unnecessary instruments in pans. Elimination of unnecessary instruments has the potential to reduce the workload in sterile processing departments and costs of managing an excessively large instrument fleet. We hypothesized that on average seventy percent of instruments in surgical pans are unused during each surgical operation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: To test this hypothesis, we conducted direct measurements of instrument usage across various surgical specialties at a full-service children&rsquo;s hospital with 8 operating rooms between June 2021 and August 2021. Surgical technicians counted the total number of used and unused instruments at the end of the surgical operation and referenced this to the count sheets. Data collection took place on non-holiday weekdays between 7:30 AM and 5:00 PM and included data from nine surgical specialties. Cases that continued past 5:00 PM were excluded from analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Observations were conducted on 328 surgical operations during the observation window. Across nine specialties, instrument usage averaged 31.6 &plusmn; 21.1%. A total of 5,564 out of 23,989 instruments were used. Instrument usage was also analyzed by surgical specialty with an emphasis on those specialties with the largest sample size (operations observed): ENT (n = 80; 33.9 &plusmn; 20.9%), general (n = 64; 29.2 &plusmn; 18.7%), ophthalmology (n = 45; 35.5 &plusmn; 22.1%), urology (n = 45; 39.3 &plusmn; 20.4%), orthopedics (n = 33; 22.2 &plusmn; 25.0%), plastics (n = 30; 26.4 &plusmn; 18.6%), and dental (n = 18; 32.2 &plusmn; 26.5%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A majority of surgical instruments are unnecessarily reprocessed. In this study we sampled 328 (1.56%) surgical operations from a two-hospital campus, with a shared sterile processing department, that performs 21,000 surgical operations per year. In the sample 18,425 unused instruments were reprocessed during the observation period (56 instruments per case). Extrapolating these numbers over a year, approximately 1,176,000 unused instruments are reprocessed between the two hospitals. The average cost of sterilizing an instrument varies by institution. However, using a per instrument cost of sterilization of $0.77 calculated by the Virginia Mason system, the cost of reprocessing unused instruments across these two institutions is $905,520 annually. We suspect this estimated cost to be as low as 90% of the actual value. Cases at the children&rsquo;s hospital are elective and skew heavily towards outpatient surgeries whereas most operations in the adult hospital are inpatient and favor larger pans with more instruments. Regardless, elimination of unnecessary instrumentation is a high value goal in terms of OR efficiency with clear cost savings.

National societies in the US (US Preventive Services Task Force, American Cancer Society, American Urologic Association) recommend that men engage in shared decision-making with their doctors regarding the decision to start prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing at age 50 or 55. Examining breast cancer screening, we previously found that most (80%) breast cancer centers in the US recommend screening practices that diverge from national guidelines. Here, we examined US cancer center prostate cancer screening recommendations, hypothesizing that some make recommendations differing from clinical practice guidelines.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We reviewed the websites of 1119 cancer centers accredited by the Commission on Cancer, of which 64 were National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers, from January-June 2021 to determine recommendations for men considering PSA prostate cancer screening. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Fisher&rsquo;s test with &alpha;&lt;.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 607 cancer centers providing recommendations about prostate screening, 451 (74%) recommended that men have a discussion with their doctor about prostate cancer screening, in accordance with national guidelines that recommend shared decision-making: 209 centers (34%) recommended discussion at age 50 and 106 (17%) at age 55 (Figure). Contrary to guidelines, 156 centers (26%) made universal recommendations for all men to start screening: 22 centers (4%) advised starting before age 50; 114 (19%) at age 50; and 16 (3%) at age 55. Non-NCI centers were more likely than NCI centers to advise shared decision-making (76% vs 54%, P=0.009) and less likely to definitively recommend screening regardless of discussion (24% vs 46%, P=0.009, Figure). While 377 centers (62%) did not discuss the risks of screening, 113 (19%) acknowledged risks without further specification, and 116 (19%) detailed risk(s) of screening.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Contrary to guidelines that advise men to discuss prostate cancer screening with their doctors, many US cancer centers (26%) recommend that all men undergo screening. While the majority make recommendations that align with national guidelines, most (62%) do not discuss screening risks. These findings are in contrast to US cancer center breast cancer screening recommendations, which we have found diverge from national guidelines in over 80% of cases. These differences between PSA and mammography screening illuminate differences in how cancer centers advise men and women considering screening. Our data also reveal opportunities to encourage shared decision-making for PSA testing&ndash;an intervention with both benefits and harms&ndash;as an alternative to universal recommendations that may increase overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of indolent tumors.

Schwartz<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health, Trauma, Acute Care & Critical Care Surgery, LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: In sudden respiratory distress and 32 weeks pregnant, a 21-year-old with sickle cell disease arrived at the ED with acute chest syndrome requiring intubation and fetal distress requiring emergent C-section (EmCS). No obstetrician was available on site, and she was too unstable for transport elsewhere. A perinatal alert was activated. The in-house trauma surgeon in conjunction with the obstetrician (en route) determined emergent surgery was required. During anesthesia induction, fetal heart tones diminished then disappeared. The trauma surgeon already scrubbed with scalpel in hand acted immediately. Less than five minutes later the baby was handed to the pediatric perinatal team in the OR who successfully resuscitated the child.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective case series of all non-traumatic EmCS performed by trauma surgeons at one institution over a 5-year period. The primary outcomes were maternal and fetal mortality. Secondary outcomes were procedure time (incision to delivery), blood loss, type of incision, and time interval from decision to delivery. We compared outcomes in this series with quality indicators and standards of care and examined similar situations nationally when patients lack access to emergent obstetrical care. We employed the ETHICAL Model<sup>1</sup> to determine if this practice is ethically permissible. The goal of this project is to: 1) present our experience with EmCS performed by non-obstetricians when patients lack access to emergent obstetrical care, and; 2) initiate discussions on how trauma surgeons can fill this gap safely and ethically.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Current recommendations endorse a decision-to-delivery interval (DDI) of &lt; 30 minutes and a procedure time of &lt; 5 minutes. All cases met these standards (see Table 1) and all elements of the ETHICAL Model (Expertise, Technical Skills, Hazards, Informed Consent, Conflict of Interest, Analysis, Literature) were satisfied.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 

Trauma surgeons can safely perform non-traumatic EmCS as they already possess the skill set necessary and traumatic C-sections are already within their scope of practice. This is ethically permissible when all elements of the ETHICAL Model are satisfied in circumstances when patients lack access to emergent obstetrical care.

Guidelines suggest the use of fluoroscopic guidance. We aimed to determine outcomes of stenting under endoscopic guidance alone.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A prospectively maintained database was utilised to identify all patients who underwent SEMS insertion in our tertiary referral centre between August 2010-June 2021. Patient demographics (age/gender), disease characteristics (benign vs malignant/location/stage), stenting intent (BTS vs palliative) and outcomes (technical success/stoma/time from stenting to resection/death/study end) were included. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Fifty-three (n=39; 73.58% male) patients underwent SEMS insertion. Indications included colorectal carcinoma (n=48), diverticular stricture (n=3) and gynecological malignancy (n=2). In the BTS cohort (n=29, mean age 63.7&plusmn;11.04), 21 (72.41%) were alive at a mean follow up of 1268&plusmn;1002.58 days. In the palliative cohort (n=24), 33.33% (n=8) were alive at the study end (mean follow up=415.01&plusmn;435 days). Mean time from stenting to death (66.67%) was 194&plusmn;167 days. Five (4 BTS, 1 palliative) patients required emergency operative intervention. One (cecal) perforation occurred. The permanent stoma rate in the BTS group was 20.6%. There was no 30- or 90-day mortality in the BTS cohort.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: SEMS placed under endoscopic visualistion alone, palliatively and as a BTS, had internationally acceptable stoma, morbidity and mortality rates. This is the largest reported series of SEMS deployed with endoscopic guidance alone. The results show that SEMS insertion can be safely performed without fluoroscopy.

Identification of positive lymph nodes in colon cancer can have significant impacts on treatment. Few studies have examined the relationship of lymph node size and its role in staging and prognosis. This study attempted to describe an association between lymph node size on pathology and metastatic colon cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Retrospective chart review was performed for patients undergoing colectomy for right-sided colon cancers between 2015-2020 across a single multi-hospital health system. Patients under age 18, or who did not have invasive adenocarcinoma on pathology were excluded. Primary endpoints assessed node size and nodal metastasis. 581 patients were stratified by lymph node size; any nodes equal to or greater than 0.5cm (n=314) were characterized as enlarged. A chi-square test was performed to analyze the differences in metastatic disease between patients with normal and enlarged lymph nodes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Demographics were not statistically significant between the two groups. The mean age was 72.4 vs 71.2 years (p= 0.22) in the normal and enlarged nodes group respectively. Gender and ethnicity were also similar among the two groups. There was no difference in lymph node sampling between the two groups (Table 1). 33.9% of all lymph nodes examined were positive for metastatic spread.

Patients with enlarged nodes (equal to or greater than 0.5cm) were significantly more likely to have evidence of metastasis than those with normal sized nodes. Further research to identify these enlarged lymph nodes on radiologic imaging is warranted to determine the role in pre-operative staging.

In March 2020, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid issued guidance that all nonurgent procedures be delayed due to the Covid pandemic. Delayed screening may lead to more advanced stages at diagnosis, which is correlated with survival, and thus may significantly reduce the efficacy of screening on CRC-related mortality. The aim of the this study was to determine if patient are presenting more acutely due to decreased screening rates.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a single-center retrospective review of all adult patients with new or recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma from 2016-2021. Presentations before March 2020 (pre-COVID) were compared to those diagnosed after (post-COVID). Outcomes between the two groups were statistically analyzed and a p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 237 patients diagnosed with CRC pre-Covid and 76 patients post-Covid. Cohorts did not differ among age, sex, race, insurance or marital status, or BMI. However, there as a trend toward more uninsured patients in the post-COVID group (4.6% vs 11.8%; p=0.06). 11.8% of patients had stage I disease, 21.1% stage II disease, 33.8% stage III disease, and 30.4% stage IV disease pre-COVID compared to 13.2%, 30.3%, 28.9% and 22.4% post-COVID (p = 0.32). There was no difference in presenting stage or disease site (p&gt;0.05). There was no difference in presentation between the groups, however, more patients did present with obstruction in the post-COVID group (5.9% vs 14.5%). The median time to surgery pre-Covid was 118.5 [34.3-181.8) days compared to 73.0 [8.8-177.5] post-Covid (p=0.25). There was no difference in 90-day mortality (6.8% pre-Covid, 5.3% post-Covid, p=0.65). There was no difference in setting presentation (p=0.69).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While screening rates have decreased during the COVID pandemic, we did not find any differences in the presentation, pathologic stage, time to surgery, or 90-day mortality between the two cohorts. These findings could result from the indolent nature of colorectal cancer and may change as the pandemic progress.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Our institution serves a very rural and poor population and there is a paucity of data for CRC outcomes in this setting. Surgical management of CRC is typically elective; however emergent surgery is required for those patients with obstruction, perforation or uncontrolled bleeding. Our study aims to analyze the short-term outcomes in our population who underwent elective versus emergent surgery for CRC. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single site retrospective review of adult patients with CRC who underwent either elective or emergent surgery between January 2011 to December 2020 at our institution was performed. Patient demographics and specific outcomes were collected. Welch&rsquo;s t-test, Fisher&rsquo;s exact test, and relative risk were used to assess the relationships between the timing of surgery and patient factors on post-surgical outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among the 466 patients who met inclusion criteria, 433 underwent elective surgery and 33 (7%) underwent emergency surgery. The emergent and elective surgery patients were similar in terms of age, body mass index and medical comorbidities. Patients who underwent emergent surgery had longer lengths of stay (LOS) than those who underwent elective surgery (10.1 vs 7.7 days; p = 0.03), an increased 30-day mortality (15.2% vs 2.1%; p = 0.002) and had a greater frequency of select postoperative complications (Table 1). Patients who underwent emergency surgery were more likely to have advanced disease (stage III-IV) than those who underwent elective surgery (p = 0.002). Emergent surgery was not associated with an increased risk of requiring inpatient rehabilitation upon discharge (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our study demonstrates increased LOS and mortality in patients undergoing emergency surgery for CRC in a rural healthcare setting. These pateints were more likely to present with advanced disease than those undergoing elective surgery with overall outcomes comparable to those previously reported in literature.

Despite being the established standard of care for colorectal cancer (CRC), surgery is performed less often for minority patients. When minority patients do receive surgery, significant variation in quality across hospitals exacerbates disparate outcomes. Prior evidence demonstrates that patients select hospitals and surgeons based on convenience, word of mouth, and physician referrals rather than objective measures of quality. We performed a qualitative study to examine factors influencing referring primary care providers&rsquo; decisions about where to refer CRC patients for surgical care.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Primary care providers were recruited via email to participate in a 20-minute interview study. Freelisting and semi-structured interview methodologies, including probes, were applied to identify factors influencing decisions when referring to a surgeon or hospital for CRC surgery. Interviews were conducted by a single trained interviewer until saturation was achieved. Three members of the research team coded each of the recorded virtual interviews. The study team calculated a salience index (Smith&rsquo;s S) for the freelisting items and used the constant comparative method to abstract themes from the semi-structured interview data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Twenty-one primary care providers participated in the interviews. 67% of participants were female, 76% reported practicing in an urban setting, and 91% reported serving minority patients. In the freelisting portion, quality, convenience, and providers&rsquo; professional experiences were found to be criteria for referral. Upon probing respondents on how they defined and determined quality during the semi-structured interviews, the providers reported relying on subjective information sources such as word of mouth reputation or unvalidated anecdotal information from operating room personnel. Primary care providers emphasized a lack of accessible, reliable, and objective outcomes data to inform surgeon and hospital selection. See table for example quotes.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This qualitative study suggests that primary care provider referral decisions overwhelmingly rely on factors of convenience, prior experience with hospitals and surgeons, and reputation as a proxy for objective data on surgeon and hospital quality. Primary care providers are tasked with adjudicating CRC care without evidence-based decision aids or outcomes data to inform recommendations on where to receive surgical care. The results show that there is a need for tools that communicate measures of surgical care quality to primary care physicians and patients, which would especially impact care of minority patients.

Kapadia<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill, Surgery, Chapel Hill, NC, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill, Biomedical Engineering, Chapel Hill, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Anastomotic leak after colectomy is a devastating complication and methods to identify patients at risk are helpful for pre-operative planning. The American College of Surgeons National Safety and Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) risk calculator is an important advancement but its predictive ability for anastomotic leak is limited with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.58. We sought to apply machine learning approaches, which have the potential to identify subtle, non-linear patterns within large datasets, to develop a novel risk model for anastomotic leak after colectomy. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Several machine learning techniques, including artificial neural network (ANN), gradient boosting machine (XGB), and random forest (RF) were applied to the NSQIP database including years 2012 to 2019. Data from 2012 to 2018 were randomly split into training and validation sets in an 80/20 ratio, with 2019 data used as a subsequent test set. Patients in whom critical data was missing, had an ostomy placed at initial surgery, or had a preoperative diagnosis of clostridium difficile or ulcerative colitis were excluded. Model performance was evaluated primarily using AUC, scaled from 0.5 (random guessing) to 1 (perfect classification). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The study included 146781 patients after excluding 63707. The incidence of anastomotic leak was 3.09%. ANN, XGB and RF performed similarly with AUC of 0.66, 0.65, and 0.63, respectively. Further analysis was performed on ANN, which had the highest performance. On the validation set, ANN showed a sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 50%, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC PR) of 0.05. On the external test set (2019 data), the model performed similarly, with AUC 0.64, sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 51%, and AUC PR of 0.04. Antibiotic bowel prep, sex, and ASA classification were the most contributory factors within the ANN model. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Preliminary development of machine learning methods showed improved discriminatory accuracy in the prediction of anastomotic leak after colectomy compared with the ACS NSQIP risk calculator and consistent performance on an external test set. While machine learning did achieve a higher AUC score compared with the ACS NSQIP risk calculator, the difference was marginal. Integration of multimodal data sources, such as pre-operative and intra-operative imaging and integration into the electronic medical record using natural language processing could further leverage the strengths of machine learning.

Hollis<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Gastrointestinal Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Health literacy impacts health behaviors including colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in the US. Prior findings suggest an association between limited health literacy and low colorectal cancer screening rates when using an extensive measure of health literacy. We hypothesize that limited health literacy when measured using a brief three-question instrument is associated with low CRC screening rates.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Cross-sectional data collected from the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) was utilized from 17 states that included a three-question measure of health literacy. Participants who met the criteria for colorectal cancer screening (ages 50-75) were included. The three-question health literacy measure scores ranged from 3-12 and were categorized as limited (scores 3-9), marginal (scores 10-11), or adequate (score 12) health literacy. Our primary outcome was whether participants met the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for colorectal cancer screening within the appropriate time interval. Bivariate comparisons were made using chi-square tests. The relationship between health literacy level and CRC screening criteria was also examined using multivariable logistic regression controlling for participant demographics, socioeconomic factors, and health status.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among 32,734 participants meeting inclusion criteria, 17,079 (52.2%) participants had adequate health literacy, while 10,403 (31.8%) had marginal health literacy and 5,252 (16%) participants had limited health literacy. Participants with limited health literacy were more likely to be male, have lower education, lower income, and uninsured (p &lt; 0.01). Lower levels of health literacy were associated with a lower likelihood of meeting USPSTF screening recommendations for colorectal cancer: 73.9% of participants with adequate health literacy, 72% with marginal health literacy, and 65.3% with limited health literacy met screening criteria (p &lt; 0.001). On multivariable analysis, limited health literacy was associated with 0.83 lower odds (95% CI 0.77-0.89) of receiving appropriate CRC screening compared to patients with adequate health literacy. Patients with marginal health literacy had similar rates of CRC screening to patients with adequate health literacy on multivariable analysis (OR 0.96), 95% CI 0.91-1.02).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Limited health literacy identified using a three-question instrument is associated with significantly lower rates of appropriate colorectal cancer screening. This three-question measure of health literacy provides a clinically applicable tool to identify at-risk patients. Further development of health literacy-sensitive interventions may provide novel mechanisms to improve CRC screening rates for these patients.

Hollis<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Patients with a new ostomy face unique postoperative challenges and frequently require longer hospital stays, unplanned emergency room (ER) visits, and hospital readmissions. It is plausible that a patient&rsquo;s level of health literacy could impact their ability to learn new ostomy skillsets and thus lead to worse outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine the association between a patient&rsquo;s health literacy level and subsequent healthcare utilization following surgery with new ostomy formation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified patients undergoing inpatient colorectal surgery with formation of a new ostomy who had a health literacy score collected in the outpatient surgery clinic as part of routine clinic intake between years 2018-2021 at a single institution in the Deep South. Patients with a prior ostomy were excluded. Health literacy was measured using the BRIEF health literacy screener tool and scores were categorized to represent adequate (17-20), marginal (13-16) or inadequate (4-13) health literacy levels. Primary outcomes were postoperative length of stay and unplanned healthcare utilization defined as any ER visit or hospital readmission within 30days of discharge. Chi-square, Fischer exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for bivariate comparisons. The association between health literacy level and postoperative length of stay was also evaluated with a negative binomial model controlling for patient and procedure factors.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

We identified 347 patients undergoing surgery with a new ostomy and health literacy score, including 205 (59.1%) patients with an ileostomy and 142 (40.9%) with a colostomy. Health literacy levels were adequate in 77.8% (n=270), marginal in 15.0% (n=52), and inadequate in 7.2% (n=25). Health literacy levels varied by race with adequate health literacy in 80.5% of white patients, 74.0% of Black patients, and 67.7% of other races (p=0.01). Patients with inadequate health literacy were more likely to be older (median age 64) compared to patients with marginal (median age 55) or adequate health literacy (median age 54; p=0.04). Median postoperative length of stay was significantly longer for patients with inadequate health literacy (8 days) compared to patients with marginal (4 days) or adequate health literacy (5 days; p=0.05). Rates of unplanned healthcare utilization were similar among health literacy groups (adequate: 14.4%, marginal 17.3%, inadequate 8.0%; p=0.55). On multivariable analysis, inadequate health literacy was associated with a 1.46 times longer postoperative length of stay compared to patients with adequate health literacy (95% CI 1.09-1.95; p=0.01). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

Lower levels of health literacy were associated with longer lengths of stay in patients undergoing surgery with new ostomy formation. Health literacy sensitive interventions may provide an important mechanism to promote more equitable recovery following ostomy construction.

Kenzik<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Optimal timing for colon cancer resection is suggested to be 30-60 days from diagnosis, allowing time for complete preoperative work up without disease progression. Patients undergoing surgery &lt;30 days from diagnosis may be at risk for worse outcomes, however this risk has been shown to be mitigated with complete preoperative work up. As significant disparities exist in the diagnosis and treatment of many surgical diseases, we sought to identify what patient and hospital factors were associated with the receipt of guideline-adherent work up and appropriately timed surgery for colon cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients &gt;66 years of age enrolled in Medicare with stage I-III colon cancer diagnosed 01/2010-12/2015 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Primary outcome was receipt of complete preoperative work-up (colonoscopy, CT or PET scan of abdomen and pelvis, and carcinoembryonic antigen test) and timely surgery (30-60 days from diagnosis). Patients undergoing surgery &lt;30 days from diagnosis who received complete work up were included in the adherent group. Patients were stratified into 4 groups: 1) adherent, 2) early surgery (&lt;30 days) with incomplete work-up, 3) appropriate surgery time with incomplete work-up, 4) late surgery (&gt;60 days) +/- work-up. Demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics were obtained from the SEER database. Characteristics between groups were compared and multinomial logistic regression performed with adherent category as the reference group.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Overall, 19046 patients met inclusion criteria. 10734 (56.4%) of patients were female, 15534 (81.6%) white and 1385 (7.3%) Black. Overall, 8800 (46.2%) of patients received adherent care, 6297 (33.1%) had early surgery and inadequate work up, 1961 (10.3%) had appropriately timed surgery but incomplete work up, and 1988 (10.4%) underwent late surgery. Compared to patients receiving adherent care, patients undergoing early surgery with incomplete work up were more likely to be female (OR 1.31 95% CI 1.18-1.45), Black (OR 1.58 95% CI 1.32-1.89), single/widowed (OR 1.20 95 CI% 1.08-1.34), and to have undergone surgery at a nonteaching hospital (OR 1.32 95% CI 1.20-1.46). Patients undergoing timely surgery with incomplete work up were less likely to have undergone surgery at a nonteaching hospital (OR 0.87 95% CI 0.79-0.96). Patients undergoing late surgery were more likely to be 80+ years of age (OR 1.31 95% CI 1.19-1.44), female (OR 1.08 95% CI 1.01-1.16), Black (OR 1.17 95% CI 1.03-1.33), single/widowed (OR 1.23 95% CI 1.15-1.32) and were less likely to have undergone surgery at a nonteaching hospital (OR 0.73 95% CI 0.69-0.78).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Patient and hospital level factors impact whether patients receive guideline-adherent colon cancer care. These findings highlight the need for interventions to improve access to guideline-adherent cancer care as a possible mechanism to combat disparities in surgical outcomes.

Readmissions after ileostomy are common and often attributed to dehydration from high stoma output. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) as a preventative measure against dehydration-related readmissions after ileostomy showed promise in a single randomized controlled trial, but outcomes have not yet been studied after implementation as a quality improvement (QI) initiative.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A &quot;preventing dehydration after ilestomy&quot; QI initiative was implemented on a colorectal surgery service at a single center. The intervention group received education on ORS use and 36 days of ORS supplies upon discharge. Total, acute kidney injury (AKI)-related, and dehydration-related 30-day readmission rates were compared after retrospective chart review from January 2020 to January 2021.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Overall 30-day readmission rates were 21% and ED visit rates were 31%. 63 of 145 eligible patients were part of the intervention group. The intervention group readmission rate was 19% compared with 23% in the control group, but this was not statistically significant including after adjustment for Charlson Comorbidity Index, elective versus nonelective procedure, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and steroid use (p=.022). There was no difference in AKI- or dehydration-related readmission.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
30-day readmissions were lower after implementation of a QI initiative designed to improve oral hydration in patients underoing ileostomy creation, but the difference was not statistically significant and was limited by its retrospective nature, small sample size, and follow up limited to 30 days. ORS may reduce readmissions after ileostomy, but further studies are needed to better understand the role for postoperative ORS.

Abelson<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Lahey Hospital, Colorectal Surgery, Burlington, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The management of rectal cancer has undergone radical changes over the past decade. Accurate pre-operative staging is of paramount importance for both prognostication and the determination of appropriate treatment options. Clinical stage 1 rectal tumors are approached dramatically differently than clinical stage 2 and 3 tumors, especially in the current era of total neoadjuvant therapy and non-operative management options for rectal cancer. Upstaging is a known limitation of current standards of pre-operative locoregional assessment typically consisting of pelvic MRI or endorectal ultrasound. The current study aims to characterize the proportion of discordance in clinicopathological staging and identify factors that may be associated with the risk of upstaging in stage I rectal cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We analyzed the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004-2017 for all patients ages 18 and older with clinical stage 1 rectal cancers defined by AJCC 7<sup>th</sup> edition. Patients were excluded if they had multiple primary tumors, missing surgical treatment or pathological staging, had received prior chemoradiation, or received any treatment at a site other than the reference center. Patients were then divided into two groups: concordant (clinical and pathological stage 1) and discordant (clinical stage I and pathological stage 2 or higher). The two groups were subsequently compared based on demographics, insurance type, distance from facility, time to radical resection, facility type (high volume and low volume), and tumor morphologic and genetic characteristics. Risk factors for staging discordance were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 7,493 patients with clinical stage 1 rectal cancer included for analysis, of which 2,440 patients (34.9%) were found to be upstaged. Of all patients with discordant staging, 38% of patients were found to have pathologically positive lymph nodes after radical resection, 48% had higher-than-expected T-stage, and 14% had both. Among patients with stage 1 rectal cancer, after adjusting for age, sex, race, and time from diagnosis to resection, higher tumor grade (grade 3 or 4) (OR 2.93 [1.13-6.83]) and KRAS mutation (OR 1.88 [1.16-3.06]) were factors associated with upstaging.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Among patients with clinical stage 1 rectal cancer, 35% of patients may be upstaged to pathological stage 2 disease or higher. KRAS status and tumor grade at the time of initial diagnosis are important risk factors for upstaging and may help identify patients who would benefit from more aggressive neoadjuvant treatment strategies.

Shao<sup>1</sup>, D. I. Chu<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Division Of Colorectal Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Bowel preparation has been shown to impact surgical outcomes. Racial disparities in bowel preparation have also been documented. However, it is unknown whether the implementation of enhanced recovery programs (ERP) may mitigate these disparities. We hypothesized that implementation of an ERP would reduce racial disparities in bowel preparation for colorectal surgery. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) institutional database, patient and procedure-level characteristics for patients receiving bowel preparations for colorectal surgery between 2012-2020 were recorded. Bowel preparation was defined as mechanical preparation with or without oral antibiotics. Bowel preparation was compared between Black and white patients in pre-ERP and post-ERP cohorts. Factors predictive of inadequate bowel preparation were determined using multivariate analysis. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 1707 patients undergoing bowel preparation for colorectal surgery were included in the study. Overall, mean age was 59.9 years (48.1-69.6), median BMI was 28.2 (24.3-33.0), 56.6% of patients were female, 27.4% of patients were Black and 72.6% were white. In the pre-ERP cohort, racial disparities were noted with Black patients being more likely not to receive adequate bowel preparation in comparison with white patients (OR=1.99, 95% CI=1.16-3.41, P=0.01). The presence of SIRS (OR=30.0, 95% CI=1.13-796.14, p=0.04), sepsis (OR=3.55, 95% CI=142.0, P=0.0009), cancer (OR=5.08, 95% CI =2.46-10.51, p&lt;0.0001), and emergency surgery (OR=27.6, 95% CI= 4.96-153.8, p=0.0002) were also associated with higher odds of not receiving adequate bowel preparation. In the post-ERP cohort, no significant differences in bowel preparation were noted between Black and white patients (OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.459-1.03, p=0.07). The presence of ascites (OR=11.60, 95% CI=1.52-88.52, p=0.02), SIRS (OR=9.60, 95% CI=1.76-52.51, p=0.009, sepsis (OR=83.11, 95% CI=13.33-518.38, p&lt;0.0001), septic shock (OR=66.85, 95% CI= 2.78-&gt;999.99, p=0.0096), cancer (OR=2.30, 95% CI=1.28-4.11, p=0.005), and emergency nature of the case (OR=105.65, 95% CI=28.24-395.28, p&lt;0.001) were associated with greater odds of not receiving adequate bowel preparation. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Racial disparities in bowel preparation for colorectal surgery patients exist. However, these disparities were mitigated by the implementation of ERP. Factors predictive of inadequate bowel preparation even after the implementation of ERP include the presence of ascites, SIRS, sepsis, septic shock, cancer, and emergency nature of the surgery. Standardizing care may offer one strategy to mitigate disparities in surgery, but other risk factors will need to be targeted.

Patil<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Ascension Providence Hospital, Dept. Of General Surgery, Southfield, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: In men and women combined, colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Nationally, incidence of new colon cancer diagnosis is highest among black men, and on average occurs most frequently among people ages 65-74. However, roughly 10% of new cases occur in individuals younger than 50. We examine colorectal cancer trends among the millennial generation defined as anyone born between 1981 and 1996 (currently ages 25-40). We aim to characterize colon cancer malignancies appearing in this younger population via analysis of demographic, clinical, and long-term outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to abstract patients with a diagnosis of colon cancer between 1992-2018. Demographic and clinical differences were compared with continuous variables analyzed using ANOVA, and categorical variables with Chi-squared tests. Cumulative life table analysis was used to compare long-term survival.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 13,077 patients were identified. Mean age at presentation was 35.2 &plusmn; 4.1 years with no significant gender differences. Colon cancer was more common in white males (71.8%) and black females (15%) compared to respective female (67.9%) and male (12.4%) counterparts, p &lt;0.001. 60% of all patients suffered from local or regionalized disease, while distant spread was higher in females (21.2%) compared to males (20.4%), p &lt;0.01. A higher percent of females (87.2%) received cancer directed surgery (CDS) compared to males (82.7%), p &lt;0.001. Average survival in months was significantly greater for females (94.2 &plusmn; 90.1) compared to males (89.0 &plusmn; 89.0), p=0.001. Overall, cancer-specific mortality was higher in males (34.5%) compared to females (31.2%), p &lt;0.001. 5-year cancer-specific survival was also greater in females (67%) compared to males (64%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In the millennial generation, colon cancer is diagnosed at equal rates between men and women and with a greater incidence in white males and black females compared to their corresponding counterparts. Most patients are found to have local or regional disease. A higher percent of female patients received CDS, faced lower cancer-specific mortality, and higher mean 5-year cancer-specific survival, despite slightly higher incidence of distant spread compared to males.

The relative costs of these two modalities are not well described. This study aims to compare the direct costs of RLR versus SRS.



<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This study was a single institution, retrospective analysis of the cost of performing RLR versus the cost of performing SRS. We used electronic medical record data from procedures dating from January 2017 to December 2018. We examined direct costs of RLR and SRS. For RLR, this included the surgery and all direct costs associated with the index hospitalization and hospital costs within 30 days following lung resection. For SRS, this included the costs of planning, simulation, and execution of SRS, as well as the cost of navigational bronchoscopy with fiducial marker placement. Indirect/overhead costs (ex. depreciation and amortization of surgical robotic and radiosurgery systems) were excluded from this study. Follow-up clinic visits, radiologic surveillance, and costs incurred more than 30 days after lobectomy or related to post-SRS complications completion of SRS were not included in the analysis. To calculate the average cost per patient, the total of all direct costs was divided by the total number of patients.



<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Costs were analyzed for 103 RLR patients and 104 SRS patients (N=207). The median length of stay for RLR was 2 days.The average direct cost of RLR ($12,197) was 39% greater than the average direct cost of SRS ($8,788). The two most expensive costs for RLR were the surgery itself ($6,591/patient) and ICU stay ($9,241/patient). Only 3% of RL patients required ICU careThe two most expensive costs for SRS were radiation oncology ($5,032) and fiducial marker placement ($3,901).




<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The average initial cost of RLR is higher than SRS per patient. ICU admission substantially increases the cost of RLR (average of $7171 per patient if ICU care needed). 44% of the cost of SRS is related to fiducial marker placement. More study, including the evaluation of the costs associated with cancer recurrence and its treatment, is needed to determine the relative cost-effectiveness of RL and SRS.

We hypothesized that instituting a quality improvement (QI) initiative to change practice would significantly reduce this unnecessary testing, reduce costs and improve healthcare efficiency.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A QI initiative was developed within the section of thoracic surgery at a single, academic teaching hospital to reduce empiric TS ordering (requiring two lab draws) before elective anatomic lung resections. Two interventions were implemented: 1) education based on current, institutional data and 2) an electronic medical record order set modification to unselect preoperative TS orders. Utilization of TS testing, blood transfusion data, and perioperative outcomes including 30-day complications, and readmission and mortality rates were tracked and compared in a pre-intervention group (2015-2018) to a post-intervention group (2020-2021). Cost data were derived from institutional charges and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services fee schedules.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 495 patients were included: 362 in the pre-intervention group and 133 in the post-intervention group. The rate of routine TSs significantly dropped after implementing the QI initiative (98 vs 20%, p=&lt;0.001). Patients were similar between pre- and post-intervention groups (see Table). There were no differences in regard to mean age (p=0.58), sex (p=0.27), presence of any comorbidity (p=0.71) and operative approach (p=0.13). However, slightly less patients in the pre-intervention group were on Apixaban (1.4 vs. 4.5%, p=0.04). Estimated blood loss was higher in the pre-intervention group, but no differences in blood transfusion rate within 30 days of surgery was observed (4.7 vs. 2.3%, p=.22). Furthermore, no differences between groups were noted in rates of Grade III/IV Clavien-Dindo postoperative complications (p=0.66), 30-day readmission (p=0.12) or mortality (p=0.93). Based on current volumes of ~200 anatomic lung resections/year, estimated cost savings from reducing TS testing from 98 to 20% would be at least $40,000 a year and lessen the resource burden of multiple lab draws. 



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Through implementation of simple interventions, our QI initiative significantly reduced the use of routine TS testing in elective thoracic surgery patients undergoing anatomic lung resection. This change in practice maintained excellent patient care outcomes and reduced the cost of unnecessary TS testing. Thus, routine preoperative TS testing can be safely reduced in most elective thoracic surgery to improve efficient delivery of care.

Benharash<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>David Geffen School Of Medicine, University Of California At Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The revised 2018 adult heart allocation policy prioritizes patients on temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) and has resulted in a nationwide rise in the use of this bridging modality. The present study characterized center-level variation in tMCS utilization under the new heart allocation policy and evaluated the impact of hospital tMCS use on waitlist outcomes.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was queried for all isolated heart transplants from August 2016 to December 2020. The study population was divided into two cohorts: Pre-policy and Post-policy centered around the rule change on October 18, 2018. We defined tMCS as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, intraaortic balloon pump or percutaneous ventricular assist device use at listing. Hospitals were further divided into tertiles of tMCS utilization (Low-tMCS, Mid-tMCS, High-tMCS) based on the proportion listed with tMCS at each center. Competing risk regressions were used to assess the association of center tMCS use with waitlist outcomes including transplantation and mortality within 1-year of listing. Prepolicy and Postpolicy hospitals were ranked according to adjusted rates of tMCS use and plotted for visualization of inter-hospital variation, with exclusion of hospitals performing &lt;5 transplants per year.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 15,897 transplant listings were included in analysis, with 7,973 (50.2%) classified as Pre-policy and 7,924 (49.9%) Post-policy. Nationally, a 10% increase in tMCS use was observed in Post-policy compared to Pre-policy (18 vs 8%, P&lt;0.001), with UNOS regions 8 (CO, IA, KS, MO, NE, WY: 23 vs 8%, P&lt;0.001) and 9 (NY, western VT: 22 vs 5%, P&lt;0.001) showing the greatest increases among regions. At a center-level, tMCS use showed no association with adjusted waitlist mortality in Pre-policy (r=-0.13), but showed a moderate negative correlation in Post-policy (r=-0.34). At a patient-level, listing at High-tMCS was associated with a greater likelihood of transplantation compared to Low-tMCS during Post-policy (subhazard ratio, SHR 1.24, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.14&mdash;1.35) but not Pre-policy (SHR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93&mdash;1.12). Considerable hospital variation was observed in adjusted rates of tMCS use, with only 3% of hospitals performing no tMCS in Post-Policy compared to 18% during Pre-policy (Figure).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The 2018 adult heart allocation policy appears to benefit patients listed at high tMCS-utilizing centers, with significant center-level variation in tMCS use as a bridge to transplant. Given the growing role of tMCS in heart transplantation under the new policy, continued center-level monitoring in its use is warranted.

<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

 Post-operative airway complications following Lung transplantation (LTx) contribute to transplant mortality and morbidity. Most transplant centers analyze and report such post-op data where multi-surgeons operate in transplant centers. A single surgeon data analysis is lacking. We have assessed post-operative airway bronchial complications in our single center done by all surgeons and separately analyzed a single surgeon&rsquo;s transplant surgical outcomes in suturing techniques to understand the survival outcomes, bronchial complications rates, and follow-up results. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Out of 901 total lung transplantation that were done between Feb 2021 to Mar 2021, a single surgeons lung transplant procedures (n=444) were analyzed. Single surgeon&rsquo;s continuous suturing (CS) and intermittent suturing (IS) techniques were evaluated for comparison. CS technique was performed with 3/0 polypropylene suture on an SH needle. IS used the same technique for the membranous portion of the anastomosis and multiple interrupted 3/0 polypropylene sutures for the cartilaginous portion. Demographics and clinical parameters were contrasted between two suturing groups. The groups were compared for post-operative bronchial complications which were categorized, and then required interventions afterwards were also analyzed. Survival was compared by generating Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Cox regression analysis was run using all variables to ascertain their impact on survival. P values &lt;0.05 were considered significant. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

 From the 444 patients of this single surgeon study, 259 received IS and 185 received CS. Demographic parameters between suture groups were as follows: age (p = 0.017), sex (p = 0.023), race (p =0.20), LAS (p &lt; 0.0001), BMI (p = 0.056), and height (p = 0.982). There was ECMO utilization in 19 patients with CS vs 18 patients with IS (p = 0.371). 

There was no significant difference in post-transplant complication rates (p = 0.629). The most common complications were stenosis (CS-14; IS-19), ischemia (CS 0; IS-7), and stenosis + malacia + dehiscence (CS 4; IS-9). Treatment for bronchial complications were varied including dilation and stent placement when indicated for the complications of both CS and IS. Kaplan-Meier curve showed no difference in survival outcomes between groups (p = 0.562). Cox regression analysis using all variables showed the type of induction (Hz 1.48; p=0.01) and CPB (Hz 1.44; p=0.024) had a significant effect on survival.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

A single surgeon&rsquo;s surgical suturing techniques adaptation in a multi-center settings of lung transplantation showed both interrupted and continuous surgical suturing techniques can be performed in selected patients. Our data indicated no difference in survival outcomes when the IS vs CS technique was utilized in a large cohort of lung transplant patients. In addition, bronchial complications and their follow-up treatment interventions were found to be comparable.

While there are studies that have investigated the relationship between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), the effect of varying HbA1c levels on outcomes seen in both on-pump (ONCAB) and off-pump (OPCAB) surgeries has not been studied. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In this retrospective cohort study, patient data from our institutional Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database was reviewed to find datapoints on preoperative HbA1c in both ONCAB and OPCAB procedures that were performed from January 2014 to December 2020. Patients were separated into on-pump and off-pump groups, and they were stratified based on the following HbA1c levels: (1) HbA1c &le; 6.0%, (2) 6.0% &lt; HbA1c &le; 7.0%, (3) 7.0% &lt; HbA1c &le; 8.5%, (4) HbA1c &gt; 8.5%. We hypothesized that higher HbA1c levels are associated with worse outcomes. Logistic regression was also performed to identify additional risk factors for sternal wound complications, and the statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 2560 patients were included in the study population. 1009 patients underwent ONCAB, and 1551 patients underwent OPCAB. For the ONCAB group, the rates of post-operative dialysis, readmission, and greater lengths of stay increased as HbA1c levels rose from &lt;6.0% to &gt;8.5%. For patients in the OPCAB group, the rate of post-operative renal failure, dialysis, sternal wound infection, and greater lengths of stay increased as HbA1c levels rose from &lt;6.0% to &gt;8.5%. Neither procedure showed statistically significant differences in operative mortality, incidence of stroke, reoperation due to bleeding, or post-operative transfusion when examining the effects of varying HbA1c levels (Table 1). When adjusted for covariates, higher BMI (OR 1.06, [1.03-1.09], p&lt;0.001), female vs male (OR 3.61 [2.03-6.42], p&lt;0.001), history of CVA (OR 2.66 [1.30-5.46], p&lt;0.001), and younger age (OR 1.04 [1.01-1.07], p-0.01) were associated with sternal wound infection. There was not a strong association between ONCAB vs OPCAB technique and sternal wound infections (OR 1.09, [0.61-1.95], p-0.78).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Higher preoperative HbA1c levels were associated with increased lengths of stay and readmission rates in patients undergoing ONCAB. Elevated preoperative HbA1c levels were also associated with increased risk of post-operative renal failure, dialysis, sternal wound infection, and greater lengths of stay in patients undergoing OPCAB.

However, the role of spousal support in lung cancer patients is unknown. This study investigated the relationship between marital status and perioperative outcomes following robotic-assisted video thoracoscopic (RAVT) pulmonary lobectomy. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively reviewed 707 consecutive patients who underwent RAVT pulmonary lobectomy by one surgeon over 10.8 years. One patient was excluded due to incomplete data. Patients were grouped as &ldquo;married&rdquo; (including married, civil union/domestic partner, or cohabitating/living together) or &ldquo;unmarried&rdquo; (including single, widowed, or divorced) based on marital status at time of surgery. Perioperative, intraoperative, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. Patient demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index, tumor characteristic, and survival status were also noted. Estimated blood loss (EBL), skin-to-skin (STS) operative time, chest tube duration, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were analyzed by Wilcoxon&rsquo;s test. In-hospital mortality and conversion to open lobectomy were analyzed by Chi-Squared and Fisher&rsquo;s tests. Kaplan Meier curves were used to analyze survival between groups. Significance was established at p&le;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 469 &ldquo;married&rdquo; patients and 236 &ldquo;unmarried&rdquo; patients. There was a significant association between marital status and gender, with female patients more likely being unmarried than male patients (p=0.0007). There was also a significant association between marital status and smoking status (p=0.0409). Multivariable analysis demonstrated &ldquo;unmarried&rdquo; status was an independent predictor of EBL (p&lt;0.0001) and STS operative time (p=0.0002). Multivariable analysis also demonstrated that female gender was an independent predictor of EBL (p&lt;0.0001), STS operative time (p&lt;0.0001), chest tube duration (p&lt;0.0001), and hospital LOS (p&lt;0.0001). While Current Smoker status was an independent predictor of EBL (p&lt;0.0001), STS operative time (p&lt;0.0001), chest tube duration (p&lt;0.0001), and hospital LOS (p&lt;0.0001), Former Smoker status was an independent predictor of STS operative time, chest tube duration, and hospital LOS (p&lt;0.0001, for each). Lastly, Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated no statistically significant difference in overall survival between married and unmarried patients.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study demonstrated that being unmarried is an independent predictor of greater intraoperative EBL and longer STS operative time. However, further investigation is required in order to fully understand the relationship between marital status and perioperative outcomes following RAVT pulmonary lobectomy.

Nearly all current descriptions of the benefits of DPC are through single institutional studies and prior pooled analyses have only focused on limb ischemia outcomes. We aimed to assess the role of the prophylactic placement of DPCs in reducing the incidence of limb ischemia, as well as the effect on mortality and bleeding, through the use of a pooled analysis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus and Embase databases using the search terms &lsquo;ECMO, Limb Ischemia&rsquo; and &lsquo;ECMO, Distal Perfusion&rsquo;. Studies were only included that compared ECMO with DPC versus ECMO without DPC. Studies with &lt; 5 patients in either arms were excluded. A random effects model with Mantel&ndash;Haenszel method was used to analyze the data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Seventeen studies met criteria for analysis. Pooled analysis included a total of 2079 patients, of which 917 patients received ECMO with DPC and 1162 patients underwent ECMO without DPC. When compared to ECMO alone, ECMO with DPC significantly decreased limb ischemia (relative risk [RR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.79; p=0.003; Figure A). No differences in mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76-1.03; p=0.12; Figure B) and bleeding complications (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.41-4.96; p=0.58; Figure C) were observed between the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although the guidelines regarding the indication for the use of DPC are not well established, our analysis demonstrates that the placement of DPC is associated with a reduced risk of limb ischemia versus no DPC, but is not associated with mortality or bleeding complications. Further studies are necessary to help guide the placement and management of DPC to further minimize limb ischemic events.

Lung cancer prevalence has been reported to be higher in cities with poor air quality. We studied whether patients&rsquo; residential AQI affected perioperative outcomes after robotic-assisted video-thoracoscopic (RAVT) pulmonary lobectomy


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively analyzed 709 consecutive patients who underwent RAVT pulmonary lobectomy by one surgeon over 10.8 years. Using the patients&#39; residential ZIP code and date of surgery, the mean AQI of the surgery year was obtained from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The majority of the patients were classified as having lived &quot;good air quality&quot;. We divided the groups into &ldquo;Very Good&rdquo; air quality with an AQI below 38.5 and &ldquo;Good&rdquo; air quality with AQI above 38.5 based on the data distribution. Perioperative outcomes were compared using Chi-Square, Student&#39;s t-test, or Kruskal-Wallis tests, with p&le;0.05 as significant.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

Patients were grouped based on AQI, resulting in 430 patients in the &ldquo;Very Good&rdquo; AQI group and 279 patients in the &ldquo;Good&rdquo; AQI group. Patients living in areas with Very Good AQI had a higher median age (68.9 yr) compared to patients in areas with Good AQI (median age=67.2 yr) (P=0.03). The group of patients living with Very Good AQI had a significantly lower rate of previous cancers compared to patients living with Good AQI (P=0.03). Most of the perioperative outcomes were similar between groups (See Table 1). The mean number of positive N1+N2 lymph nodes was significantly higher (P=0.01) in patients living in Good AQI. Lowest postoperative systolic blood pressure (SBP) occurred significantly earlier postoperatively in the Good AQI group than in the Very Good AQI group (P=0.013). Multivariable analysis found that age, Very Good AQI, previous cancer, and number of positive lymph nodes were independent predictors of intraoperative estimated blood loss. Multivariable analysis also found postoperative pneumothorax after chest tube removal and the postoperative day of lowest SBP to be independent predictors of hospital length of stay and of chest tube duration (P=0.0001).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our study demonstrated a link between worse patients&#39; residential AQI with a higher rate of previous cancer and a higher number of positive N1+N2 lymph nodes. However, our study showed that there is a difference in health outcomes even for people living in areas classified as &quot;Good&quot; air quality and suggests that living in the lower bounds of that Good AQI classification can provide health benefits.

Respiratory failure (RF) following pulmonary lobectomy is a serious complication associated with increased mortality in limited institutional series. While improvements in perioperative care have reduced the incidence of overall complications, few have examined the development of RF after thoracic operations at the national level. The present study evaluated patient and hospital characteristics associated with RF and sought to identify the presence of inter-hospital variation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The 2016-18 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried to identify elective adult (&ge;18 years) hospitalizations for pulmonary lobectomy with the diagnosis of lung cancer. Patient characteristics, including the development of respiratory failure, operative approach (open vs minimally invasive) and resected lobe, were ascertained using International Classification of Diseases 10<sup>th</sup> Revision codes. Multi-level, mixed effects models were developed to identify factors associated with RF and evaluate its associated in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), hospitalization costs and 30-day non-elective readmissions. Random effects were predicted with Bayesian methodology and used to rank hospitals by increasing RF risk attributable to each institution.

Of an estimated 84,364 patients, 8.0% developed RF. Compared to those without, patients with RF were on average older (67.4 vs 69.1 years) and had a higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (3.6 vs 5.4, p&lt;0.001). After adjustment, female sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98), minimally invasive approach (AOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.56-0.71, ref: thoracotomy) and middle right lobe resection (AOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.89, ref: upper right lobe) were associated with lower odds of RF. Congestive heart failure (AOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.41-1.90) and neurological disorders (AOR 2.28, 95% CI 1.94-2.67) increased the likelihood of RF. Furthermore, RF was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (AOR: 30.7, 95% CI 20.9-45.0), longer LOS (5.3 days, 95% CI 4.9-5.7) and greater hospitalization costs ($20.9K, 95% CI 19.1K-22.7K). Odds of readmission were also increased among patients with RF (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.23-1.45). Approximately 15.8% (95% CI 13.6-18.2) of the variance in RF was attributable to institution, with baseline risk ranging from 0.1 to 21.4% (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The present work identified several factors associated with RF following elective pulmonary lobectomy and found it to be associated with inferior clinical outcomes and greater resource utilization. We noted significant inter-hospital variation in the development of this complication. Further investigation of contributing factors is necessary to guide the development of systemic quality improvement efforts.

These adhesions and prior repairs may distort the anatomy and increase the risk of iatrogenic injury. However, with little data available on re-do operations, it is not clear if these patients are also at an increased risk for other intraoperative and postoperative complications.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using our single institution-maintained database all patients who underwent an elective aortic arch repair with the same surgeon between April 2010 and November 2020 were identified. The patient charts were reviewed looking specifically for all patients who underwent an elective arch repair after having undergone a prior median sternotomy with any cardiac or aortic intervention. Outcomes for both the elective aortic arch repair group without prior sternotomy and the elective arch repair group with prior sternotomy (&quot;re-do&quot; group) including stroke, length of stay, pulmonary complications, and post-operative death were analyzed.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 63 patients underwent an elective aortic arch repair during the stated time. Of these 63 patients, 40 were noted to have undergone a prior median sternotomy. Between the two groups, there was no statistical difference for most intraoperative factors including cardiopulmonary bypass time, circulatory arrest time, and transfusion of blood products. There was, however, a statistical difference between circulatory arrest time with patients in the re-do group requiring 27.8&plusmn;14.4 minutes versus 22.7&plusmn;9.9 minutes in the patient group without any prior sternotomies, p =0.030. There was no statistical difference in postoperative outcomes including stroke, delirium, renal failure, and death. Patients in the re-do group were noted to have a higher number of operative re-explorations, 7 vs 3 patients, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.734). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Though surgeons are likely to encounter more technically difficult operations in patients who have undergone prior sternotomies, the data show that patients are not at any statistically significant increased risk for most intraoperative or postoperative adverse outcomes when compared to patients who have not undergone a prior sternotomy. Patients with prior sternotomies were noted to have an increased cardiopulmonary bypass time likely owing to the timelier dissection associated with scar tissue. Though care should be taken with patients who undergo re-do sternotomies, surgeons should feel confident that patients are not at an unnecessarily increased risk of intraoperative or postoperative complications.

Protocols currently differ based on instituition. For the last 3 years, our institution has surveilled patients at 3 months, yearly for 3 years, and at 5 years following the operation. We hypothesize surveillance CT scans performed at 3 months will identify any pathologies related to the ascending aortic repair that will require re-intervention; additional imaging may be superfluous.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using our single institution-maintained database, 311 patients who underwent an elective aortic hemiarch repair between February of 2010 and March of 2021 were identified. The timing for and stability of surveillance imaging was reviewed, paying special attention to pathology associated with the repair.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: OF the 311 patients who underwent elective aortic hemiarch repair, 217 completed surveillance imaging. 187 patients had their initial imaging around 3 months following the operation, 85 patients completed imaging around one year, and 54 patients were imaged 208 years post-operatively with some patients undergoing multiple scans during this period. Nine patients required re-intervention; of these 9, four patients demonstrated pathology, on CT scan, associated with the actual ascending repair. Two patients developed a pseudoaneurysm (PSA), one at the distal aspect of the repair and one at the left ventricular outflow tract. The other two patients had degeneration of known distal aortic aneurysms. The two PSAs were intervened upon within the first 3 months and the degenerating aneurysms were intervened upon at 1 and 2.5 years post-operatively.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These data support surveillance imaging completed at 3 months following ascending aortic replacement is sufficient to identify pathology related to the repair. While other indications may dictate ongoing surveillance, for most patients, the need for further imaging is potentially zero.

We sought to analyze patterns of recurrence and survival in patients with pathologic stage I and II MCC.
 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients from six centers with AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> edition pathologic stage I-II MCC (2005-2020) who underwent excision and had a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were identified. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize location and timing of first recurrence. Clinicopathologic characteristics were correlated with recurrence, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS).

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 420 patients with pathologic stage I-II MCC, 81 (19.3%) developed disease recurrence. Of those with recurrence, 17 (4.0%), 42 (10.0%), 12 (2.9%), and 10 (2.4%) had first-site local, regional, distant, and multiple-site relapse respectively. Patients with stage II disease had a similar rate of local recurrence compared to those with stage I disease (5.2% vs. 3.7%, p 0.51), but were more likely to receive adjuvant radiation to the primary tumor site (67.7% vs. 49.7%, p&lt;0.0001). Additionally, there was no difference in regional (9.3% vs. 12.5%, p 0.35) and distant (2.8% vs. 3.1%, p 0.56) relapse rates between stage I and II disease. Among those with locoregional recurrence, the median RFS was 7.5 (IQR 3.5-11.5) months while those with distant recurrence had a RFS of 14 (IQR 7-21) months. Female patients with small extremity tumors &lt;14mm had a low risk of relapse (5.3%, n=3/57), all of which were locoregional. Five-year DSS for those without recurrence and those with locoregional, distant, and distant plus locoregional recurrence was 100%, 77.2%, 56.3%, and 57.1% respectively (p&lt;0.0001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Wide local excision and SLNB with selective radiation provides durable disease control in the vast majority of patients with pathologic stage I-II MCC. Locoregional recurrence occurs earlier and more frequently than distant recurrence, and female patients with small tumors appear to constitute a particularly low risk population for relapse. These data can help inform surveillance strategies for localized MCC.

Debate exists on timing and utility of imaging to detect AL post-esophagectomy. We sought to evaluate the efficacy and timing of radiographic AL evaluation in esophageal cancer patients post-esophagectomy.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective database of esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy at a single institution from 2004-2020 was used to determine the utilization, timing, and sensitivity of radiologic testing for AL post-esophagectomy.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Seventy-six patients were identified of which 37 (49%) had a cervical anastomosis. Sixty-four (84%) underwent 72 &ldquo;asymptomatic radiographic leak tests&rdquo; (ARLT), 8 of which had 2 different tests, including: 41 fluoroscopic esophagrams (57%), 18 CT-esophagrams (25%), and 13 upper GI studies (18%). Sixteen patients (21%) developed clinical signs of AL (hemodynamic instability, leukocytosis) and underwent &ldquo;symptomatic radiographic leak tests&rdquo; (SRLT) with fluoroscopic esophagram (n=9, 12%) or CT-esophagram (n=7, 9%). ARLT and SRLT were positive in 3/64 (5%) and 16/16 (100%) patients, respectively, for 18 total ALs (24%). Among the 16 SRLT(+) patients, 1 was also ARLT(+), 12 were initially ARLT(-), and 3 were not evaluated by ARLT. The median postoperative day for ARLT and SRLT was 4.5 (IQR 4.0-5.0) and 9.0 days (IQR 6.0-13.0), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of ARLT for detecting AL were 13.3% and 98.0%, respectively.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Based on the low ARLT sensitivity, routine use of imaging to detect asymptomatic ALs post-esophagectomy may be limited. Symptomatic ALs often present in a delayed fashion, even after initial negative imaging.

Lymphangiomas are rare, cystic tumors that represent congenital malformation of the lymphatic vessels. They present most commonly in the head and neck region in children but have also been reported intra-abdominally in various age groups. This study compiles one institution&rsquo;s experience treating abdominal lymphangiomas with the purpose of describing the clinical features, management, and outcomes of this rare pathology.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This is a single-institution, IRB-approved retrospective review of abdominal lymphangiomas presenting between January 2010 and February 2021. The diagnosis of lymphangioma was made on histopathology from either endoscopic or excisional biopsy of the lesion. Demographics, diagnostic imaging, histopathologic characteristics, and outcomes were analyzed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There were 29 females and 19 males, most were adults (&gt;18y, 38; 79%), with a mean age of 43 years at diagnosis (range, 4 days to 87 years). Tumors ranged in size from &lt;1cm to 30cm. Only 1/3 were symptomatic, most commonly with abdominal pain (9; 19%) On pre-operative imaging, mural nodules or thickened walls were present in one case. The majority of lymphangiomas were associated with the small bowel or its mesentery (31; 64.5%), followed by the colon/omentum (7; 15%). Most patients underwent surgical excision (29; 60%) with incomplete excision in one patient due to extensive local invasion, and three (10%) patients required multi-visceral resection. The average duration of follow-up was 31 months (range, 1 &ndash; 105 months). During the follow-up period, none of the patients who underwent resection had malignancy or developed malignancy. Three deaths were reported secondary to medical causes, unrelated to the lymphangioma.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

Most abdominal lymphangiomas arise from the small bowel and are found incidentally and carry a favorable prognosis. Resection should be reserved for symptomatic lesions or when there is diagnostic doubt.

Blansfield<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Geisinger Surgery Institute, Danville, PA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Esophageal cancer is an aggressive cancer with 5-year survival rates of 20%. Due to its aggressive nature, most therapeutic approaches are multimodal, involving chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. The landmark CROSS trial demonstrated a survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiation versus surgery alone in T1N1 or T2-3N0-1 patients. Theoretically, the benefits of chemotherapy and radiation should be most pronounced in patients with advanced disease and least pronounced in early-stage disease. Thus, T2N0M0 cancer, the nebulous intermediary, remains a difficult stage to treat; national guidelines offer multiple treatment options. This study aims to compare survival outcomes in clinical T2N0M0 esophageal cancer via treatment modality, identify factors associated with treatment modality, and compare clinical to pathologic stage.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective study was performed of clinical T2N0M0 esophageal cancer using the National Cancer Database (NCDB 2006-2016). Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery (NCRT+ESOPH) were compared to patients who underwent esophagectomy first (ESOPH). A subgroup of patients who underwent chemotherapy and/or radiation following esophagectomy was used for overall survival comparison using Kaplan-Meier estimate and log-rank tests for the entire study duration and at 1, 3, and 5 years. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with order of treatment.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 1662 patients in this study (NCRT+ESOPH: 904 [54.4%], ESOPH: 758 [45.6%]). In the ESOPH arm, 159 (9.6%) patients had chemotherapy and/or radiation following surgery (ESOPH+Adjuvant). Among patients who received chemotherapy and/or radiation, survival benefit was improved but not statistically significant when chemoradiation was performed preoperatively (NCRT+ESOPH median survival was 64.8 months versus 50.1 months for ESOPH+Adjuvant, p = 0.537). Use of NCRT+ESOPH was correlated with more recent year of diagnosis (median year of diagnosis was 2013 versus 2011 for ESOPH, p &lt; 0.001). Between 2006 to 2016, NCRT+ESOPH treatment rates rose from 33% to 74%. Patients who received NCRT+ESOPH were younger and more likely to have reported no comorbidities (Charlson-Deyo score of 0: 71.8% versus 61.2%, p &lt; 0.001). Notably, 41% percent of patients were over-staged (T1 or lower after esophagectomy first &ndash; ESOPH group), and at least 32.5% were under-staged (N &ge; 1 in ESOPH group).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
T2N0M0 remains a difficult tumor to characterize, and pathological staging corresponds poorly to clinical staging. The use of neoadjuvant therapy has risen significantly in the past decade. However, the lack of a significant survival benefit to neoadjuvant therapy that we find may be secondary to over- or under-staging. Future work is needed to more accurately stage these patients so those who should undergo chemotherapy and radiation get the treatment they need and those who do not are spared.

Treatment varies based on disease stage at presentation. For patients with localized disease, primary treatment is surgical resection, whereas for distant disease systemic therapy is recommended. For patients with clinically localized disease, there is wide practice variation in the performance of preoperative imaging studies, which may upstage patients and/or change plans for surgical resection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of different preoperative staging on management of patients with clinically localized Merkel Cell Carcinoma.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified patients who presented to our facility between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2020 with clinically localized MCC (confined to the skin, without evidence of nodal spread or signs/symptoms of disease disease). These patients were included if they had a diagnosis of MCC on chart review, clinically staged localized disease, and were evaluated at our institution prior to surgery. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose management changed based on preoperative imaging.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 79 patients, of whom 67(85%) had preoperative staging with imaging performed significantly more often in older patients (p=0.019). Patients had a median age of 74, 13% were immunosuppressed. 75% had T1 tumors, while 16% had T2 tumors. PET/CT was performed in 43(64%) patients, 37(55%) CT, 24(36%) brain MRI. Zero patients had a change in management based on preoperative imaging. There were 3 indeterminate findings, two of which were stable on observation. The other patient had an indeterminate parotid lesion with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, but subsequent recurrence in this location. There were no changes in surgical management based on results of preoperative imaging.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Preoperative imaging for patients with clinically localized MCC did not impact management in any case. More selective use of preoperative imaging staging may be warranted, considering risk factors such factors immunosuppression, older age, and tumor size.

Chamberlain<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of South Florida College Of Medicine, Tampa, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) with peritoneal washings for the detection of metastatic gastric cancer is a widely used modality in treatment planning for gastric cancer. It is claimed that detection of occult M1 disease by DL can avoid unnecessary laparotomies, more accurately stage patients for clinical trial accrual, and allow appropriate initial neoadjuvant or definitive chemotherapy selection. Despite its wide acceptance, most trails assessing its utility are small and retrospective in scope. This systematic review analyzes the largest sample size to date on the topic and provides clarity on the benefit of diagnostic laparoscopy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A comprehensive PUBMED and Google Scholar search was conducted utilizing the keywords diagnostic laparoscopy (DL), peritoneal washings, and gastric cancer. 22 studies involving 5,256 gastric cancer patients of various T stages were identified for analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

5,256 patients with gastric cancer underwent DL plus peritoneal washings. Meta-analysis showed that 28.9% (95% CI 0.238-0.347) had positive peritoneal metastatic disease detected by either DL alone or cytology from peritoneal washings. Amongst studies reporting subgroups, peritoneal metastasis was detected in 83.8% (95% CI 0.749-0.899) patients with T2-T3 disease, and in 93.9% (95% CI 0.762-0.987) patients with T3-T4 disease. In studies that reported on the utility of DL and washing for T3 gastric cancer patients, 76.0% (95% CI 0.657-0.840) were found to have occult metastatic disease. Studies reporting on the utility of DL in T2 gastric cancer patients identified occult M1 disease in 10.9% (95% CI 0.058-0.197) patients.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

DL and peritoneal washings are a critical component of pre-operative gastric cancer staging. More than 25% of all gastric cancer patients are likely to have detectable occult M1 disease at time of DL and peritoneal washings. Higher T stage is associated with a higher rate of DL detectable occult M1 disease, but more than 10% of patients with T2 tumors will also have been found to have occult M1 disease on DL and washing. Noting that there is a paucity of data on the yield of DL and washing for superficial or T1 gastric cancers, DL with washings is otherwise endorsed as a standard for all gastric cancer patients and, given the current adoption of neoadjuvant approaches to systemic therapy, is best done coincident with port or venous
access placement.

Lau<sup>1</sup>, R. S. Chamberlain<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>HCA Healthcare/USF Morsani College of Medicine GME: Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point, Department Of Surgery, Hudson, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Approximately 50% of all gastric cancer patients will suffer a recurrence within the first two years. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a novel serum biomarker for detecting early tumor recurrence. Numerous studies have evaluated the efficacy of ctDNA as a screening tool and to assess tumor burden. More recently, a limited number of studies have evaluated its ability to predict post-operative relapse. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature surrounding ctDNA&rsquo;s ability to predict post-operative recurrence in gastric cancer patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A comprehensive literature review of PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials was conducted. Keywords searched included gastric cancer, ctDNA, circulating tumor DNA, and liquid biopsies. Only articles written in English were included. The outcome analyzed was ctDNA positive recurrence rates of gastric cancer patients.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

6 Studies involving 424 patients with stage I-IV gastric cancer were included. Baseline ctDNA positivity was reported in 194 patients (45.7%). 3 of 6 Studies stratified baseline ctDNA positivity based on staging: 7/18 (38.8%) patients with stage I disease, 34/88 (38.6%) patients with stage II disease, 97/188 (51.6%) with stage III disease, and 29/37 (78.4%) with stage IV disease. In 4 of 6 studies, among the patients with baseline positive ctDNA, 30/50 (60%) patients recurred. 2 studies stratified ctDNA detectable recurrence based on stage: 2/6 (33%) post-operative positive patients recurred with stage I or II disease, 9/15 (60%) post-operative positive patients recurred with stage III disease, 3/3 (100%) of stage IV disease patients with positive post-operative ctDNA recurred. Overall, 183/382 (47.9%) patients recurred in the 5 studies that tracked recurrence. Of those who recurred, 102/183 (55%) developed detectable ctDNA during postop monitoring, which ranged from 5 months to 5 years.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

ctDNA has shown promise as a biomarker for gastric cancer and may be beneficial in monitoring recurrence after surgical resection with intent to cure. Among the current gastric cancer cohort, nearly half of all patients had ctDNA present at diagnosis. Among the ctDNA positive group, 60% of patients ultimately recurred after treatment. ctDNA positivity at baseline is correlative to tumor burden and advancing stage. Nearly half of all patients who recurred had a positive post-operative ctDNA suggesting a possible role for liquid biopsy in surveillance. Additional longitudinal studies specifically evaluating the stratification of ctDNA positivity recurrence rates based on stage, T stage, tumor volume and histology subtypes are needed to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from ctDNA monitoring in addition to or as a replacement for traditional radiographic imaging.

The survival benefit of chemotherapy for patients with Stage IV gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) is well established. However, to our knowledge, modifiable factors for the underutilization of chemotherapy need to be determined.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for stage IV GEP-NETs from 2009-2016. The cohort was stratified by patients who received chemotherapy and who did not receive chemotherapy. Patient demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns were captured. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with chemotherapy utilization, and Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess median overall survival and three-year survival rate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 2,367 patients with stage IV GEP-NETs identified, 1,647 (69.6%) received chemotherapy. Patients with age &ge;75 (OR=0.19), no insurance (OR=0.52), and &ge;2 comorbidities (OR=0.002) were less likely to receive chemotherapy than patients with age &lt;75, private insurance, and no comorbidities (all P&lt;0.005). More importantly, in the subgroup with small bowel and colon as NET primary sites, which had the greatest percentages of patients receiving surgery (46.4% and 41.8%, respectively), receiving surgical intervention was significantly associated with lower probability of receiving chemotherapy (OR=0.6, P&lt;0.005). Longer median survival and three-year overall survival advantage were identified for patients who received chemotherapy (8-9 months and 4.4%, respectively, vs. 1-2 months and 1.7%, respectively, when no chemotherapy was received, P&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

While surgical intervention should be considered by physicians on an individual basis, increasing efforts to ensure patients with Stage IV small bowel or colon NETs receive chemotherapy as an adjuvant treatment is warranted because chemotherapy is positively associated with improved overall survival. In addition, interventions to diminish socio-economic disparities in receiving chemotherapy for patients with Stage IV GEP-NETs is warranted.

Baker<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Loyola University Chicago Stritch School Of Medicine, Department Of Surgery, Maywood, IL, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Loyola University Chicago Stritch School Of Medicine, Maywood, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Recent randomized controlled trials have identified an association between neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) and disease-specific survival in the management of resectable gastric cancer. The majority of the patients included in these studies had tumors with relatively advanced T stage (T3) or node positive disease. The value of NCT in patients presenting with early-stage gastric cancer has not been established.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We queried the National Cancer Data Base to identify patients with gastric adenocarcinoma between 2006 and 2015 who had clinical stage T2N0 (cT2N0) on presentation and underwent surgical resection. Multivariable logistic regression (MVR) was used to identify factors associated with use of NCT. Patients who received NCT were 1:1 propensity matched for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), histologic differentiation, facility type, insurance type, and receipt of adjuvant therapy with those who underwent upfront surgical resection. Log rank test was used to evaluate for differences in overall survival (OS) between matched cohorts.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

1258 patients met inclusion criteria; 402 (32%) underwent NCT while 856 (68%) underwent upfront surgical resection. On univariate comparison, patients undergoing NCT were more likely to receive radiation than those undergoing upfront surgical resection (61.9% vs 27.1%, p&lt;0.001) but there was no statistically significant difference between cohorts in rates of margin negative resections between NCT and upfront surgical resection groups (94.5% vs 93.6%, p=0.293). On MVR, increasing age (aOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95-0.98) and minority race (aOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30-0.57) were associated with a reduced adjusted odds of receiving NCT, while moderately differentiated tumors were associated with an increased adjusted odds of receiving NCT (aOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.01-3.06) relative to well differentiated tumors. On comparison of matched cohorts, patients who received NCT were found to have lower rates of 5-year OS relative to patients who received upfront surgical resection (64.8% vs 49.1%, p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 

In patients presenting with early stage (cT2N0) gastric adenocarcinoma, NCT does not appear to be associated with improvement in OS compared to upfront surgical resection. Newer NCT regimens that are now in use may show a benefit and represent an area for further study.

The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has expanded significantly over the last decade, helping to personalize cancer treatments. In this study, we analyze single institutional outcomes based on NGS testing for patients with stage IV colorectal (CRC) and high-grade appendiceal (HGA) adenocarcinomas. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was a retrospective review of genomic analyses and outcomes in patients with metastatic CRC or HGA treated at a high-volume tertiary center from 2012-2019. Descriptive statistics were performed as well as Kaplan-Meier survival analyses based on mutation status.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

103 patients (68 CRC, 35 HGA) were identified. The majority were female (55.3%) and white (80.6%), with a median overall age of 56 at diagnosis. Overall survival was longer for patients with CRC versus HGA (55.8 vs. 30.5 months, p=0.008). Many patients had peritoneal metastases (100% HGA, 84% CRC), with most undergoing cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (66% CRC, 57% HGA). Nearly all patients (91% CRC, 94% HGA) underwent systemic chemotherapy as well, with FOLFOX being the most common first-line regimen (47% CRC, 54% HGA). Eleven different commercially available NGS panels were utilized (size range: 31-1200 genes), with a minority of patients undergoing more limited RAS/RAF sequencing. The largest available panel (Oncoplus) was the most frequently used in both groups (44% CRC, HGA 46%). CRC patients had more total mutations on average (2.9 vs. 1.6, p=0.02) and more frequent mutations for individual genes including APC (44% vs. 6%, p&lt;0.01), tp53 (44% vs. 20%, p=0.03), and Kras (49% vs. 29%, p=0.05). For CRC patients, there was a near-significant decrease in survival associated with mutations of Kras (66.2 vs. 42.3 months, p=0.16), Smad4 (55.8 vs. 16.7, p=0.08), and PIK3CA (66.1 vs. 40.1, p=0.06). In HGA patients, tp53 mutation was associated with statistically significant lower survival (34.3 vs. 13.4, p&lt;0.01) [Table 1].


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Metastatic CRC and HGA have distinct mutational profiles which may aid diagnostic evaluations in some cases. Mutation status for several commonly tested genes (tp53, Kras, Smad4, PIK3CA) may have prognostic value in the treatment of CRC and HGA patients.

Brown<sup>1</sup>, M. Khreiss<sup>1</sup>, T. K. Riall<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Arizona, Surgical Oncology/Surgery, Tucson, AZ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Periampullary cancer can be categorized as biliary, intestinal, or pancreatic-type in origin. The NCCN guidelines for the primary treatment of resectable periampullary cancer continues to be surgery upfront. However, with the evolution of neoadjuvant therapy options, we hypothesize that more patients with ampullary cancers receive neoadjuvant therapy over time and these patients will have better overall outcomes that upfront surgery. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This is a NCDB retrospective study of surgically resected clinical Stage I-III periampullary adenocarcinomas (duodenal or Ampulla of Vater) from 2010-2017. Treatment groups included surgery alone, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), adjuvant therapy (AC), and perioperative therapy (PAC) (neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy). Groups were compared by Charlson-Deyo index, location of tumor, pathologic stage, clinical stage, positive LNs, total LNs examined, and survival. We then compared all margin negative groups in a subset analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of the total 16,162 patients included in this study, 52.6% (n=8,503) underwent surgery alone, 2.9% (n=469) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 43.5% (n=7,027) underwent adjuvant therapy and 1.0% (n=163) underwent perioperative therapy. Patients were significantly older in the surgery alone group (70.3yo, P&lt;0.001), were more likely to have Medicare (63.9% vs 46.4%/45.7%/37.7%, p&lt;0.0001) or no insurance (3.1% vs 2.2% NAC, 2.9% AC, 1.3% PAC, p&lt;0.0001), have more comorbidities (Charlson Score &gt;2, 9.9% vs 5.1% NAC, 6.1% AC, 6.8% PAC, P&lt;0.0001) and have clinical Stage I disease (44.78% vs 26.2% NAC, 28.4% AC, 18.4% PAC, p&lt;0.0001). The neoadjuvant groups (NAC, PAC) were more likely treated at an academic facility. When looking at Stage II disease, all chemotherapy groups increased median survival, with the largest increase in survival of 14.78 months (32.76 months surgery alone vs 47.54 months PAC) in the perioperative group. The survival benefit was also greater in Stage III disease (19.58mo surgery alone vs 43.07mo NAC, 50.79mo PAC) in groups receiving neoadjuvant therapy.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Though the standard of care in resectable periampullary cancers is initial surgery, with the recent advancements in chemotherapy, neoadjuvant therapy should be considered in all cases to improve outcomes and survival.

Regionalization of open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) to high-volume centers has been promoted, as outcomes have been linked to surgeon experience. However, the utilization of robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD) has continued to increase across a variety of centers. The Food and Drug Administration has recently turned its focus to cancer surgery and the need for studies demonstrating non-inferiority of the robotic approach on primary oncologic outcomes. With this in mind, we set out to describe the long-term oncologic outcomes of RPD as it relates to overall institutional expertise.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective review of the National Cancer Database from 2010-2018 was performed. Institutions were divided based on their OPD and RPD experience; highest volume (top 10<sup>th</sup> percentile) or lower volume (bottom 90<sup>th</sup> percentile). The combination of these designations generated 4 distinct cohorts: high OPD/high RPD (group 1), high OPD/low RPD (group 2), low OPD/high RPD (group 3), and low OPD/low RPD (group 4). Oncologic outcomes were analyzed via Chi-square, ANOVA, Cox regression, and binary logistic and multivariate regression with post-hoc group comparisons with Bonferroni correction.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Pancreaticoduodenectomies were completed at 715 institutions; only 138 (19.3%) performed RPD. Highest volume centers were defined as at least 14 RPD and/or 84 OPD over the 9-year study period. Of the RPD (n=874) performed, 36% were in lower volume centers. There were no significant differences across the four cohorts with respect to demographic variables, including age or Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index. Group 1 had a significantly longer average time to surgery from diagnosis (mean=80.6d) compared to group 3 (31.6d, p = 0.004) but no other significant differences existed between the groups. Group 1 also had an increased rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to all other groups (p &lt;0.05). Group 4 had the highest level of complete resection with microscopically negative margin (84.7%), significantly more than only group 1 (75.4%, p = 0.009). Lymph nodes harvested were, however, significantly higher in group 1 (mean: 28.1) compared to group 2 (18.2, p &lt;0.001), group 3 (18.7, p &lt;0.001), and group 4 (16.6, p &lt;0.001), with no significant difference in lymph node positivity. There was no difference in overall survival between the groups (group 1: 28.1mo, group 2: 28.8mo, group 3: 24.2mo, group 4: 21.6mo; p= 0.55).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Long-term survival in RPD is not impacted by the quality of oncologic resection, institutional volume, and preferences towards OPD/RPD approach. Further studies are needed to better identify institutional factors that influence safety and quality in complex robotic cancer surgery.

Divino<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Mount Sinai School Of Medicine, General Surgery, New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Colon neuroendocrine tumors (ColonNET) are rare and the role of surgical resection in non-metastasized tumors is unclear. The purpose of the study was to examine if the general recommendation of surgical resection for these tumors prolonged survival using a national database.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Patients from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) with primary histologically confirmed ColonNET between 2007 and 2016 were included in the study. Other inclusion criteria consisted of adult patients (&ge;18 years old), with known surgery status/type. Patients with ColonNET in the appendix, under palliative care, or metastasized cancer were excluded. We assessed five year overall survival rates using Kaplan Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression after resection, non-resection surgical management (i.e. local tumor destruction, electrocautery,etc.), or no surgery. Multivariate analyses were adjusted with age, sex, race, insurance type, Charlson-Deyo co-morbidity score, grade, clinical T, clinical N, stage, tumor site, and receipt of chemotherapy.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 1,375 patients met the inclusion criteria. Participants were on average 61 &plusmn; 13 years of age, female (53.8%), white (74.0%), and had private insurance (49.4%). The majority of patients received a resection for their primary tumor (88.2%) as compared to non-resection surgical management (4.4%) or no-surgery (7.4%). Patients who received resection as compared to those who did not receive surgery had prolonged 5 year survival (81.7% vs. 69.3%; univariate Log-Rank: p=0.0001, multivariate Cox proportional Hazards Ratio (HR): 0.32 (95th CI: 0.21,0.49), p&lt;0.0001). Non-resection surgical management in comparison to no surgery demonstrated a similar relationship (5 year survival: 91.8% vs. 69.3%; multivariate HR: 0.35 (0.13,0.90), p=0.03).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

To our knowledge, this is the first large national study to demonstrate that surgical management increases five year survival rates for non-metastasized colon neuroendocrine tumors. Surgical intervention should be considered for non-metastasized neuroendocrine tumors in the colon.

Pitt<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin, Surgery, Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Overutilization of the medical system contributes to significant healthcare expenditures in the United States (U.S.). Overuse is particularly prevalent in oncology where many tests and treatments have significant costs with low relative value. We sought to understand public attitudes towards medical utilization and their association with beliefs about cancer.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An online survey was conducted among a nationally representative sample of 1,205 adults (&gt;17y) in the U.S. using Prolific Academic. Participants with a personal history of cancer or who failed attention checks were excluded. Medical utilization preferences were characterized with the validated, single-item Maximizer-Minimizer elicitation question (MM1). Those who favored taking action in situations where it is unclear if a medical test or procedure is necessary were considered &ldquo;maximizers&rdquo; and compared to those whose answers were neutral or leaned towards waiting and seeing (&ldquo;neutral/minimizers&rdquo;). Beliefs about the incidence, survivability, preventability, and fear and worry of cancer were assessed with validated questions from the Health Information National Trends Survey. Univariate analysis was conducted using chi-squared and Student&rsquo;s t-test.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1,131 eligible participants responded (93.9%). The respondents were 52.6% male, 74.1% White, and had an average age of 45 years (SD 16 years). When asked their medical usage tendencies, 25.4% (n=287) were maximizers, 45.5% (n=514) were neutral, and 29.2% (n=330) were minimizers. When comparing maximizers to neutral/minimizers, there were no differences in age or sex, but maximizers had a significantly higher percentage of black respondents (16.7% vs. 10.4%) and lower percentage of White (71.4% vs. 75.1%), Asian (4.5% vs. 6.4%) and Hispanic (5.9% vs. 7.2%, p=0.04) respondents. Maximizers more often overestimated the average person&rsquo;s lifetime incidence of cancer (19.1% vs. 13.0%, p=0.01) and believed they personally were more likely than average to develop cancer (23.6% vs. 17.4%, p=0.03). Maximizers also were more likely to have a high level of worry about cancer (15.7% vs. 11.3% p=0.05). There were no differences between the groups based on fear or the perceived survivability and preventability of cancer.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While U.S. adults with medical maximizing tendencies do not believe cancer is more deadly or preventable, they are more likely to believe they are personally at higher risk of being diagnosed with cancer and overestimate the overall incidence of cancer. Targeted and personalized education about cancer and its risk factors may help reduce the overutilization of oncologic medical care.

Studies conflict on whether gender influences survival in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEPNETs), with some suggesting improved survival in women. GEPNETs may express receptors and genes responsive to female hormones, suggesting a possible mechanism for sex-based survival differences. This study examined the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to determine whether gender impacts survival in GEPNETs, hypothesizing that women would have improved survival, and that this difference would be greater in pre-menopausal age women compared to older women.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients with pancreas, small bowel, or gastric cancers in NCDB from 2004 to 2016 (n=655,024) were reviewed, selecting patients with GEPNETs or adenocarcinomas. Demographic, tumor, treatment, and socioeconomic characteristics were compared between men and women and age &le;45 or &ge;65 years using Fisher exact and Wilcoxon tests as appropriate. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) from diagnosis, assessed by Kaplan-Meier method with Log-rank test for significance. Multivariable Cox models adjusted for confounders.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Included were 73,521 patients with small bowel (SBNETs), gastric (GNETs), or pancreas (PNETs) neuroendocrine tumors (11.2% of all patients, 36,197 female, 37,324 male). Survival did not consistently correlate with sex among 375,026 patients with pancreas, small bowel, or gastric adenocarcinoma (hazard ratios for death [HR] 0.97, 0.99, 1.08, p&lt;0.01, 0.4, &lt;0.01, respectively). In GEPNETs, median survival was longer for women than men (118.8 vs 98.9 mo., p&lt;0.001). Women lived longer regardless of primary site, with the largest difference in GNETs (median OS 139 vs. 85 mo.) and smallest in SBNETs (121 vs. 116, p&lt;0.001 for both) (Figure). Pre- and post-menopausal age patients showed similar sex-based survival differences. Men were older (median 63.0 vs. 62.0 years), more likely to have high grade tumors (5.8 vs 3.8%), stage 4 disease (21.6 vs 18.4%), and private insurance (45.3 vs. 44.3%), while women more often had surgery (73.2 vs. 70.9%, p&lt;0.01 for all). After multivariable adjustment for these confounders and primary site, female sex remained independently associated with improved survival (HR 0.84, p&lt;0.001). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Women with GEPNETs have better OS compared to men regardless of primary site. Differences in survival were similar in pre- and post-menopausal age patients, arguing against hormonal effects as the sole cause. High-grade and metastatic NETs were more common in men, yet survival differences persisted after multivariable adjustment for these features. Uncovering the biologic basis of increased adverse tumor features in men and better survival in women could reveal novel GEPNET treatment targets.

It has been proposed that the increase in the rate of malignancies in the younger population is, at least in part, due to an increase in cell mutations from genetic segregation. The aim of the present study was to develop a study frame registry of familial cancers in our community.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An IRB approved on-line survey on cancer diagnoses and familial malignancies occurrence was sent to all patients treated for malignant tumors at a university-affiliated comprehensive cancer center. Responses were completed and confirmed by further communication with the patients, or their relatives. Cancers were grouped by their organ diagnoses and when possible, by pathology reports on diagnosis and stage. Family-tree constructs were grouped into families with 1, 2, 3 or &ge;4 malignancies (CG1, CG2, CG3, and CG4 groups) on first blood transmission (grandparents, parents, brother/sister, son/daughter, aunt/uncle, or first cousins). For families with more than 2 malignancies, family trees were grouped into Low, Medium, or High probability of transmissible mutations. While M and H-transmissible families are being scheduled for personal interviews, H-transmissible mutations families have been, in addition scheduled for genetic testing and advice.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We report on 797 responders (patient/family) including CG1 (n=96 or 12%), CG2 (n=144 or 18%), CG3 (n=118 or 15%), and CG4 (n=209 or 26%), and 231 (29%) are still waiting for diagnosis confirmation. The most common cancer diagnoses were breast (22%), lung (15%), and colorectal (11%). Malignancies of genitourinary system for males/females were similar in ratio with the most common was ovarian cancer (7%). In view of our preliminary data, breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers are more frequent in families in the CG3 and CG4 groups when compared to CG1 group. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Cancers with genetic predisposition as breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers are more frequent in families in the CG3 and CG4 groups when compared to CG1 group. Preventive measures as early screening and genetic counseling could enhance the chances of getting early-stage diagnosis.

While cancer-associated cachexia is driven by the tumor&rsquo;s effect on the body, data are lacking on the association of anatomic location and cachexia. We hypothesize that tumor location in the head of the pancreas is associated with cachexia.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Treatment na&iuml;ve patients with PDAC who underwent pancreatectomy at a tertiary care hospital between 2012 &ndash;2020 were identified retrospectively. Patients with pancreatic head (n = 24) or body/tail tumors (n = 24) were matched by sex, age, N and T stage. Clinical, serologic, and anthropometric variables were obtained at the time of diagnosis. Skeletal muscle index (SMI), muscle radiation attenuation (MRA), and adiposity were measured at the L3 vertebra on CT imaging. The primary outcome was presence of cachexia (&gt; 5% body weight (BW) loss in the past 6 months). Descriptive statistics, signed rank and Cochran Mantel Haenszel tests are presented. We performed RNA sequencing on available archived tumor specimens (n = 6 head, n = 9 body/tail) to explore enriched differentially expressed genes and altered pathways.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Cachexia was more prevalent in patients with pancreatic head tumors compared to body/tail tumors (71.4% vs 42.9%, p=0.045). Similarly, percentage BW loss was higher with head tumors (7.9% vs 2.5%, p&lt;0.001). Overall adiposity was actually higher with head tumors (371.7 vs 345.4 HU, p=0.005). Despite differences in BW loss, patients in the two groups had similar body mass indices (26.9 vs 28.0, p=0.427), SMI (39.6 vs 39.5 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>, p=0.220), and MRA (28.7 vs 30.1 HU, p=1.00). Combining BW loss, SMI and MRA into a cachexia score based on a more robust definition, patients with pancreatic head tumors were more likely to be cachectic (p=0.025). Serum albumin (3.9 vs 4.4 g/dL, p&lt;0.001) was lower and bilirubin (4.5 vs 0.4 mg/dL, p&lt;0.001) was higher in patients with head tumors. Patients with body/tail tumors were more likely to be alive at endpoint (41.7% vs 12.5%, p=0.030) and had longer median survival (21.8 vs 11.1 months, p&lt;0.001). Of interest, tumors from cachectic patients demonstrated activation of the White Adipose Tissue Browning Pathway and this appeared to be exclusive to only those with tumors in the head of the pancreas (p=0.0002). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: PDAC within the pancreatic head is associated with higher prevalence and greater degree of cachexia. Biliary obstruction and hypoalbuminemia were associated with pancreatic head tumors, suggesting compounding effects of nutrient malabsorption on cachexia. Select patients with pancreatic head tumors may benefit from nutritional prehabilitation as a means to improve outcomes. Browning of adipose tissue is a well-known feature of cancer cachexia and genes contributing to this pathway are predominantly expressed in adipose tissue. Our exploratory observation of enriched pathways associated with cachexia warrants further investigation.

Benharash<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>David Geffen School Of Medicine, University Of California At Los Angeles, Department Of Surgery, Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Esophagectomy is considered a highly complex multicavity operation and is associated with significant postoperative morbidity, including pulmonary complications (PC). We sought to identify factors associated with PC and assessed the clinical and financial impact of such complications in a contemporary, nationally representative cohort of esophagectomy patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The 2010-2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried to identify all elective adult hospitalizations for cancer-related esophagectomy. Relevant comorbidities and complications were identified using International Classifications of Diseases 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> revision diagnosis codes. Pulmonary complications were defined as a composite of prolonged mechanical ventilation (&ge;96 hours) and pneumonia. Multivariable logistic and linear regressions were used to identify patient and hospital factors associated with PC. Furthermore, the risk-adjusted impact of PC on in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), hospitalization costs and 30-day non-elective readmissions was also evaluated.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 23,176 patients who underwent esophagectomy, 18.4% developed at least one pulmonary complication, with decreasing incidence from 19.8% in 2010 to 15.9% in 2018 (non-parametric test for trend&lt;0.001). Patients who developed PC were older (64.8 vs 63.6 years, p&lt;0.001), more commonly female (20.1 vs 17.5%, p=0.02) and had a greater burden of comorbidities as measured by the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (4.0 vs 3.6, p&lt;0.001). After adjustment for patient, operative and hospital characteristics, female sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.40), Medicaid coverage (AOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.40-2.36, ref: private) and congestive heart failure (AOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.71-2.60) were associated with increased odds of PC. Furthermore, PC was associated with significantly increased likelihood of mortality, a 16.1-day increment in LOS, $65,300 in attributable hospitalization costs and greater odds of 30-day readmissions.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Postoperative pulmonary complications continue to occur at high incidence and were associated with significantly increased mortality and resource utilization following esophagectomy. Further investigation to identify contributing factors and develop mitigation strategies is necessary to reduce the impact of these complications in this vulnerable population.

We aimed to examine the magnitude of and reasons for avoidable and prolonged hospital stay following an admission from the ED for new colon cancer.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective single institution analysis was conducted of patients who were newly diagnosed with colon cancer following a presentation to the ED (ED-dx) between 2017-2018. Their initial ED presentations were examined using defined criteria to determine which patients were safe for discharge, and thus were avoidable admissions. Patients who met criteria for admission were examined for ideal length of stay (LOS), determined using defined criteria for condition resolution. Prolonged LOS was defined as actual LOS being 2 or more days greater than ideal LOS.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Ninety-seven patients had ED-dx. Twelve (12%) had avoidable admissions, and 24 (25%) required urgent intervention. The majority (58%) of avoidable admissions were solely admitted for cancer work-up. Patients with avoidable admissions were more likely to be non-English speakers (50% vs 85%, p= 0.005), more functional at baseline (83% vs 46% ECOG 0, p= 0.049), and less likely to have a right-sided colon mass (25% vs 59%, p= 0.028). A trend was noted towards avoidable admissions more often presenting with weight loss (50% vs 33%, p= 0.25), having longer duration of symptoms (median 24 vs 7 days, p=0.14), and less commonly with nausea/vomiting (8% vs 20%, p= 0.33) or diarrhea (0% vs 14%, p=0.16). Among the 61 patients who had necessary admissions but did not require urgent intervention, 79% had prolonged LOS. There was a median difference of 10 days (IQR 2-15 days) between actual and ideal LOS. There was a trend toward patients with prolonged LOS having greater comorbidities (Charlson score 3 or higher; 50% vs 39%, p=0.057) and greater frailty (ECOG score 2 or more; 46% vs 15%, p=0.09), but no difference in age, sex, race, language, insurance, housing status or cancer stage. These patients were less likely to present for colitis (2% vs 23%), but otherwise no difference in reasons for admission was detected.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Admissions from the ED for new or suspected colon cancer were largely warranted, however prolonged hospital stays were very common in these patients. Avoidable admissions more often occurred in non-English speaking patients, healthier patients and patients with less acute symptoms indicating a possible disparity in access to care outside the ED. Patient characteristics and clinical indications were unable to account for why patients had prolonged hospital stay. Other potential causes such as a lack of social support, lack of accessible primary care, and patient and physician preference remain to be investigated. Further investigation is needed to develop interventions to reduce avoidable admissions and unnecessary LOS so that healthcare resources can be appropriately directed.

Critical care illness burden associated with severely injured patients at risk of hemorrhagic shock has been poorly characterized. We aim to describe the individual and additive effects of multiorgan failure (MOF) and nosocomial infection (NI) on patient morbidity and delayed mortality.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A secondary analysis of harmonized data from two large prehospital randomized controlled trials (Prehospital Air Medical Plasma (PAMPer) Trial and Study of Tranexamic Acid during Air and Ground Medical Prehospital Transport (STAAMP) Trial) was conducted. Only those patients who survived beyond the first 24 hours post-injury were included. Patients were stratified by development of MOF only, NI only, neither, or both and diagnosis of early (&lt;3 days) versus late MOF (&gt;3 days). Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate risk factors of NI and MOF and subsequent mortality. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 1404 patients who were enrolled collectively in PAMPer and STAAMP, 125 patients died within the first 24 hours following injury and were excluded from further analyses. Of the remaining 1279 patients, 18.5% developed MOF only (n=237), 8.8% developed NI only (n=113), and 10.6% were diagnosed with both MOF and NI (n=136). Patients developing NI and/or MOF were significantly sicker than those who did not develop either, with greater injury severity, lower GCS, and greater shock indexes (all p&lt;0.001). Those who developed only NI had a 7.1% incidence of 30-day mortality; however, only MOF and both MOF and NI were associated with significantly higher mortality (14.9% and 15.4%, P&lt;0.001). [FIGURE 1] These results were independent of gender and race, but were dependent upon age, with increasing age associated with higher incidence of MOF (p&lt;0.001), NI (p=0.003), and 30-day mortality (p&lt;0.001). Patients developing MOF and NI required longer periods of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital stay, and were more likely to be discharged to rehabilitation facilities compared to those developing only MOF (all p&lt;0.001). Patients who developed early MOF, which preceded NI, had greater 30-day mortality compared to those who developed late MOF (15.1% vs 5.4%, p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: MOF and NI remain common complications for those who survive traumatic injury. Multiple organ failure is the strongest independent predictor of mortality following injury in this cohort, but when combined with nosocomial infection, results in higher resource utilization.The pathophysiology of MOF following trauma versus infection-induced MOF may be different, each contributing to distinct patterns of morbidity and mortality.

Determining specific risk factors which lead to neurosurgical intervention would reduce the morbidity and mortality of traumatic ICH and decrease transfer of patients with a low likelihood of requiring intervention to a higher level of care.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients admitted or transferred to a level 1 trauma center from October 2015 to September 2019 with GCS 13-15 and traumatic ICH on initial head computerized tomography (CT) scan. Multivariate regression was utilized to determine significant associations.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 816 patients with traumatic ICH (mean age 76 [61-85], 53.3% male), 91.2% did not require neurosurgical intervention.

Dorfman<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Massachusetts Medical School, Surgery, Worcester, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The Caprini risk assessment model (RAM) is widely used to assess risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, it is time-consuming with 31 components, and poses challenges with inter-rater reliability as some definitions remain subjective. This study aimed to determine if an abbreviated model could perform similarly in VTE risk assessment.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients aged 18 years and older, and admitted for over 24 hours at a Level I Trauma Center from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018. Demographic and clinical data were analyzed to generate Caprini scores. Using a cutoff of p &lt; 0.05 on logistic regression, the individual components of the original Caprini RAM most highly associated with VTE were identified and used to calculate an abbreviated Caprini score. Logistic regression assessed odds of inpatient VTE and either the original or abbreviated Caprini RAMs. Receiver operating characteristic curves and c-statistics were generated to assess each model&rsquo;s discriminatory ability.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The study sample was comprised of 1,279 patients. Ten risk factors met the p-value cutoff for inclusion in the abbreviated model (recent major surgery, length of surgery greater than two hours, transfusion, restricted mobility greater than 72 hours, central venous catheter, current major surgery, age, history of VTE, hip or leg fracture, and serious trauma). The median score for the original model was 8 (interquartile range [IQR] 5-13), and the abbreviated model was 6 (IQR 3-10). The abbreviated model, as compared to the original, had a similar odds ratio (1.17 vs 1.07, both p-values &lt;0.001), c-statistic (0.747 vs 0.753), sensitivity (0.73 vs 0.76) and specificity (0.62 vs 0.61).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: An abbreviated Caprini RAM performs similarly to the original in this sample of trauma patients. An abbreviated model may streamline workflow and allow for automation in electronic health records by removing subjective variables, potentially enhancing its use in resource limited settings.

We sought to investigate the association of all levels of stress-induced hyperglycemia with mortality among geriatric trauma patients at a level 1 academic trauma center.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a retrospective review of all geriatric patients admitted to level 1 academic trauma center over a 3-year period (January 2018- December 2020). The trauma registry was utilized. Data collected included demographics, injury severity score (ISS), emergency department (ED) blood glucose level, ED systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mortality. Based on ED blood glucose level, the patients were divided into 4 groups, &quot;Not&quot; hyperglycemic (&lt;120), &quot;Mild&quot; hyperglycemia (120-150), &quot;Moderate&quot; hyperglycemia (151-199) and &quot;Severe&quot; hyperglycemia (200 or &gt;). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of stress-induced hyperglycemia (SIH) and mortality adjusting for injury severity score (ISS) and ED SBP.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 4433 geriatric patients were admitted to the trauma service during the study period, 3358 patients did not have a history of diabetes. Mean age was 81.5 +/- 8.6 years, 2206 (65.7%) were females and 2993 were white (89.2%). Mortality was 114 (3.4%). Univariate analysis results show a statistically significant association between mortality and glucose groups (p&lt;0.001). The number of deaths in the four glucose groups were: 30 (2.0%), 32 (3.8%), 20 (6.2%) and 10 (12.2%) respectively.

Palacio<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Valley Health System / McAllen Medical Center, Trauma, McAllen, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Management of traumatic cervical vertebra 2 (C2) fractures is unclear. Anderson and D&#39;Alonzo classify odontoid fractures into type I: oblique fracture through the odontoid tip, type II: fracture through the base of the dens, type III: fracture through the body of C2. Although some guidance favors conservative non-operative therapy for type I, III, and non-displaced type II dens fractures, this remains controversial as some guidance favors surgical treatment for all type II fractures given high non-union rates. Overall, unclear guidance to conservative vs surgical treatment or anterior vs posterior approach exists. This retrospective NTDB study identified traumatic C2 fractures including type II to determine morbidity and mortality related to surgical vs non-operative management.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Trauma Database (NDTB) was queried from January 2014 to December 2019. All subjects with C2 fractures were included. Glasgow Coma Scores (GCS) were categorized as &gt;8 mild or moderate, &le;8 severe. Injury Severity Scores (ISS) were categorized as 1-8 minor, 9-15: moderate, 16-24 severe, and &gt;24 very severe. Outcomes included mortality, hospital admission, ICU admission, and hospital/ICU length of stay (LOS). The effect of surgery was the main variable in interest, and possible covariates or moderators included sex, age, race, ethnicity, ISS, and GCS. Relationships were tested using logistic regression or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Analyses were done in Rv4.0.5.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 42,003 subjects were included in the study, and 9,187 had surgery. The surgery group had slightly more males and relatively more subjects with severe ISS or severe GCS. Age range was 1 to 89; surgery group subjects had median (67) and interquartile range (IQR: 47, 78) lower than non-surgical group (median: 73, IQR: 56, 83). Mortality rate was 0.7% (295 of 41,519, 484 missing). Surgery was associated with substantially lower rates of mortality (p&lt;0.001), but the effect of surgery on mortality was moderated by the GCS (chi-squared=10.7, p&lt;0.001). For mild or moderate GCS, mortality went from 0.07% with surgery to 0.23% with no surgery; and severe GCS mortality was 0.29% with surgery to 7.69% without surgery. Surgery increased admission to the hospital (no surgery admission: 96.8%; surgery: 98.5%; p&lt;0.001) and to the ICU (no surgery admission: 46.0%; surgery: 62.8%; p&lt;0.001). Differences in hospital and ICU admission rates were moderated by ISS (p&lt;0.015). Surgery increased hospital and ICU LOS by a median of 2 days (p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Although unclear guidance exists on C2 fracture management, this NDTB study demonstrates lower mortality in patients with C2 fractures undergoing operative management. This includes odontoid screw fixation, anterior C1-C2 transarticular screws, posterior C1-C2 fixation, and application of surgical halo vest. Although surgical management increases LOS, the mortality rate is much lower at 0.07% compared to 7.69%.

Sigal<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Reading Hospital, West Reading, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Potentially Inappropriate Medications (PIMs) are well described risk factors for traumatic events, primarily ground-level falls, in older patients. Based on the American Geriatric Society 2019 updated recommendations of medications to avoid, we analyzed the association of selected PIM therapeutic categories, as well as a separate analysis of medications with anticholinergic mechanism of action, on the prevalence of recurrent traumatic events in those over age 65. We hypothesized that the use of PIMs would be associated with an increased incidence of trauma recidivism.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective chart review of from February 1, 2013 through August 1, 2018 of patients age &ge; 65 with a traumatic injury at a Level 1 Trauma center was performed. Traumatic events were defined as those injuries severe enough to require a trauma team activation or consultation in the Emergency Department as well as isolated extremity and hip fractures after a ground-level fall. A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) using age, sex, race, and Injury Severity Score was performed between patients with one trauma encounter and those with more than one trauma encounter. Discriminant function analysis was used to determine PIM categories most associated with recurrent traumatic events. Logistic regression was then performed incorporating PIM categories identified by discriminant function. We analyzed anticholinergics as a separate category, as the mechanism of action was common in many PIM categories. A p value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
PSM yielded a match of 5,271 patients in each group. In a univariate analysis, cardiac (C), antiplatelet or anticoagulant (AP/AC), psychiatric or neurologic (P/N), and anticholinergic (ACH) medications were each associated with recurrent traumatic events compared to the absence of these agents (83.3% vs 80.1%, 63.5% vs 58.6%, 46.3% vs 38.5%, and 20.2% vs 16.8%, respectively all p value of &lt;0.001). In a logistic regression analysis, the increased risk of traumatic recidivism reached statistical significance for AP/AC, P/N and ACH groupings 18% (95% CI 8-28%, p &lt; 0.001), 32% (95% CI 22-43%, p &lt;0.001), and 14.3% (95% CI 3-27%, p &lt; 0.01) respectively. For cardiac medications, the 10% increased association did not meet statistical significance (95% CI 9.9-22%, p = 0.087). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Continued use of PIM is associated with an increased risk of geriatric trauma recidivism. We identified P/N and AP/AC categories and anticholinergic mechanism of action as associated with recurrent trauma in this population. Our data shows that prescribers should routinely perform medication reconciliation to minimize recurrent geriatric injury. When conducted in a shared decision-making manner, prescribers can now quantify for their patients the risks versus benefits of continuing these medications.

Urban<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, Surgery, Aurora, CO, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, Emergency Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Historically, time to definitive management has been considered a critical determinant of outcome after traumatic injury. The concept of the &ldquo;golden hour&rdquo; captures this prevailing doctrine. The current literature is mixed on the relationship between pre-hospital on-scene time and outcomes, and there are no studies exploring the relationship between pre-hospital time and time in the ED prior to surgical management. We hypothesized that EMS scene time is related to time to the OR and impacts operative management of the severely injured patient. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We interrogated a prospectively maintained trauma data repository from a single urban Level 1 Trauma Center. Inclusion criteria were limited to patients transported by ground ambulance from the scene of injury. For bivariate analyses, we assumed normal distributions to calculate correlation coefficients and simple linear regression models. We used unpaired t-tests to compare group means.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 1359 patients met inclusion criteria. There were 75 operative trauma patients with recorded ED arrival-to-OR incision times (49% blunt, 51% penetrating). There was a significant positive correlation between scene time and ED arrival-to-OR time with a slope of 14.02 (CI 95% 9.6-18.8, P&lt;0.01, Figure 1A), demonstrating that for every minute on-scene, patients spend an average of 14 additional minutes in the ED prior to surgical incision. After stratifying by injury type, the positive correlation was maintained in both penetrating and blunt trauma patients but with different slopes (penetrating 6.29, blunt 16.61, P&lt;0.001, Figure 1B). Mean ED arrival-to-OR incision time (minutes) was significantly longer for blunt injury (271.3) than penetrating (89.45, P&lt;0.0001) but with more variability (SD 202.5 vs SD 84.92, respectively). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study is the first to investigate the relationship between EMS scene time and the time from ED arrival to OR incision. Here, we show that longer on-scene time is linearly associated with longer time in the ED prior to surgical incision. Improved EMS detection for level of acuity may contribute, but further investigation of this relationship is needed. Additionally, operative patients with blunt injuries spent more time in the ED prior to surgery and had more variability in ED arrival-to-OR time compared to penetrating trauma. This may result from differences in decision-making between penetrating trauma, where the need for operative intervention is typically more obvious, and blunt injuries, where operative decision making can be more nuanced, albeit still urgent. Future study is needed to identify those patients that require urgent operative intervention, especially the less obvious, bluntly injured.

Much controversy still exists about which hospital service is best suited to manage these patients. Our hypothesis is, however, that baseline patient severity of illness (SOI) score drives patient outcomes, not the hospital service managing these patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Retrospective review of all IHF patients from 2014&ndash;2018 at our Level 1 trauma center. Basic demographics obtained. Patients divided into type of service line they were admitted; surgical vs non-surgical. Primary outcomes included hospital length of stay (HLOS), time to OR, time to VTE prophylaxis, performance improvement (PI) occurrences (defined by the Trauma Quality Improvement Program), 30-day mortality, and readmissions. SOI score was controlled for to see if there was a difference for HLOS and PI occurrence between admitting services. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and regression analysis for continuous variables. Significance was p&lt;0.05.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 366 total patients analyzed with the same ISS. 102 were admitted to a surgical service and 264 to a non-surgical service. Average overall age was 80 years (p=.264) and 66.9% were female (p=0.12). There was no statistical difference between outcomes when comparing admitting services (see table). Controlling for SOI score, there was no difference between admitting service for HLOS or PI occurrence. However, SOI score was a significant predictor for increased HLOS and PI occurrence (p&lt;0.001) via regression analysis. There is a 6.06-fold increase in PI occurrence going from mild to moderate SOI score (p=0.001). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is no difference in patient outcomes based on admitting service, rather it is the SOI score that is a better predictor of outcomes for isolated hip fracture patients.

Burns<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>East Tennessee State University, Trauma, Johnson City, TN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Trauma remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States. The shock index is a valid tool used to detect impending circulatory collapse in the pre-hospital setting. A ratio of &gt;0.7 has been shown to have higher rates of mortality than a normal ratio of 0.5-0.7. As validation of the shock index requires high sample sizes, the majority of retrospective studies have been performed at urban Level 1 Trauma Centers. We hypothesized that the shock index would accurately predict mortality in a rural Level 1 Trauma Center. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective study performed at a Level 1 Trauma Center in Johnson City, Tennessee. All 5090 patients included in the study were treated by the trauma team between January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2016 and December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2019. Shock indexes were calculated for all patients, both pre-hospital and on arrival to the ED. The relationship between the shock index and outcome variables were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Our outcome variables included total hospital days, total ventilator days, total ICU days, disposition, Injury Severity Score (ISS) and transfusion totals. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Logistic regression was used to analyze mortality and blood product usage based on the shock index value. Patients with a shock index of &gt;0.9 in both the ER and pre-hospital setting were found to have a significantly higher mortality rate and a greater need for blood products. On the other hand, patients with a shock index of &lt;0.7 had a significantly higher rate of survival with less need for blood products in the pre-hospital and ER setting. There were small positive correlations between a shock index of &gt;0.9 and total hospital days, total ventilator days and ISS. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Access to trauma centers continues to be a major issue in the United States, causing overall longer transport times and time to definitive care centers. Based on our study, the shock index remains a valid tool for predicting mortality at rural trauma centers, along with predicting need for blood products. With our data, we continue to recommend its usage in both urban and rural trauma centers.

Miles<sup>1</sup>, H. Everett<sup>1</sup>, R. Maxwell<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Surgery, Chattanooga, TENNESSEE, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Trauma-induced coagulopathy contributes to morbidity and mortality in trauma patients. Thromboelastography (TEG, Haemonetics &reg;) measures the degree of clot formation and dissolution through a rotational force applied to the blood sample of a patient and is used to optimize resuscitation by noting certain coagulation deficiencies that can be treated with specific blood component replacement. Recent studies have demonstrated a hypercoagulable TEG profile in female trauma patients compared to males, conferring a possible survival advantage. We hypothesized that TEG profiles would reveal a relative hypercoagulable state in female compared to male trauma patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: As a part of a practice management guideline, all trauma patients seen at a level 1 academic trauma center believed to be at risk for hemorrhage received a TEG analysis from December 2019 to June 2021, and a retrospective review of results and outcomes was conducted. Female and male patients were compared with TEG values as the primary outcome variable. Secondary outcomes including hospital length of stay (LOS), number of surgical interventions, and ventilatory requirement were also investigated.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1385 patients met inclusion criteria and received a TEG analysis, with 866 (64.0%) being male and 499 (36.0%) being female. Female patients were older (64.6 &plusmn; 23.1 vs. 52.2 &plusmn; 21.5 years, p&lt;0.001) and had a higher initial GCS (12.8 &plusmn; 3.8 vs. 11.6 &plusmn; 4.9, p&lt;0.001). On TEG profile, female patients had a higher alpha angle (73.6 &plusmn; 6.5 vs. 71.6 &plusmn; 7.2 degrees, p&lt;0.001) and higher maximum amplitude (MA) (68.2 &plusmn; 7.6 vs 65.8 &plusmn; 6.8 mm, p&lt;0.001) when compared to male patients. There was no difference in R time or K time between groups. Female patients had a shorter hospital LOS (5.9 &plusmn; 7.5 vs 9.17 &plusmn; 19.55 , p&lt;0.001), required fewer surgeries (0.7 &plusmn; 1.6 vs 1.2 &plusmn; 1.9 operations, p&lt;0.001) and had lower rates of mechanical ventilation (22.6% vs. 39.8%, p&lt;0.001) compared to male patients.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Female trauma patients were found to have more hypercoagulable indices on TEG at the time of initial trauma evaluation compared to males with a higher alpha angle and MA. Intrinsic differences in the coagulation profiles of male and female trauma patients should be further investigated to optimize modern resuscitation strategies.

Development of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) in cases of adult splenectomy following trauma are reported to occur in 1-3% of cases. Incidence of this complication leads to increased mortality rates, length-of-stays (LOS), and costs for patients. In cases where no previous pancreatic injury was noted, we hypothesized that the use of sutures in splenic hilum ligation instead of staples reduced the rate of incidence.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Adult trauma patients (age &ge;17 years) that underwent non-elective splenectomy from 2010-2020 were retrospectively evaluated from the hospital trauma registries of all three adult Level 1 trauma centers in the state of Indiana: Indiana University Methodist Hospital, Eskenazi Hospital, and Ascension St. Vincent Hospital. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant, currently incarcerated, expired within 72 hours of hospital admission, or had a pancreatic injury diagnosed preoperatively or intraoperatively. Clinically relevant POPF (Grade B and Grade C) were defined and identified based on the 2016 update of the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Between 2010 and 2020, 419 adult splenectomies following trauma were conducted at Level 1 trauma centers in the state of Indiana; 278 passed exclusion criteria and were included in our analysis. CR-POPF developed in 14 cases (5.0%). Sutures alone across hilar structures were used in 200 cases, 7 of which developed CR-POPF (3.5%). Staples alone were used in 46 cases, 4 of which developed CR-POPF (9.5%). A combination of staples and sutures was used in 28 cases, 3 of which developed CR-POPF (10.7%). 4 cases did not report their technique, but POPF did not develop in any of these patients. Controlling for demographic and clinical factors, the use of sutures alone was associated with a lower rate of CR-POPF compared to the use of any staples, either alone or combined with sutures (p=.060). Patients that developed CR-POPF had a mean LOS of 38.09 days, compared to 18.04 days in patients that did not (p=.005).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In our 10-year retrospective review of POPF, we find the complication to be rare but morbid, with statistically significant (p&lt;.01) prolonged length of hospital stays that require multiple imaging studies and interventions, leading to increased costs. We identified a protective effect of borderline significance (p&lt;.10) when sutures alone are used in splenic hilum ligation compared to any form of staples, alone or in combination. We propose a new institutional norm that CR-POPF develop in 5.0% of traumatic splenectomies and conclude that further study of optimal technique for emergent splenectomy is warranted.

Kerby<sup>1</sup>, J. Jansen<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, AL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Recidivism following assault injuries remains a major public health problem in the U.S. Identifying geographic patterns in assault injury recidivism could lead to more targeted injury prevention initiatives. The aim of this study was to conduct a geographic analysis of such injuries in a major metropolitan area, in an attempt to inform injury prevention efforts.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This is a geospatial analysis of electronic health record and trauma registry data in a single metropolitan area, from January 2016-December 2020. We extracted data on patients who had suffered assaults, and then re-presented subsequently with a further assault-related injury, or gunshot wound (GSW) in particular. Places of residence were geocoded by census tract, using SPSS. Choropleth maps showing the number of recidivistic injuries per census tract were then created using QGIS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 3,379 index assault injuries during the study period. Among these patients, there was an 8.3% (n=281) overall injury recidivism rate and a 4.5% (n=153) assault injury recidivism rate. 0.9% (n=32) of patients experienced a GSW as their recidivistic injury following initial assault. Panel (A) shows the number of recidivistic assault injuries, and panel (B) the number of recidivistic GSW injuries, per census tract, in the central part of the metropolitan area.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The assault- and GSW-specific injury recidivism rates are similar to those found in studies of other communities. While there is a visual suggestion of clustering, the case numbers were too low for a spatial statistical analysis. Furthermore, the small number of recidivistic individuals per census tract will make the geographical targeting of violence injury prevention initiatives difficult.

Blunt splenic injuries (BSI) are common in trauma. In hemodynamically stable patients, non-operative management, including observation and embolization, has become a mainstay of therapy. For moderate- and high-grade injuries, institutional protocols often rely on The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) injury scale to determine appropriate therapy. In 2018, The AAST revised their splenic injury scale, specifically considering vascular injuries and active bleeding, to better delineate the risk of failure of non-operative management. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the grade of injury, as determined by the radiologist on computed tomography (CT), was consistent with the revised injury scale.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using a retrospective analysis, we evaluated all patients with splenic injuries over a 26-month period after The AAST splenic injury scale revision was performed. Data were abstracted from the patients&rsquo; electronic medical record including demographics, mechanism of injury, vitals on presentation, resuscitation needs, radiologist-determined CT splenic injury grades, and initial management. CT reports and imaging were then independently reviewed to evaluate injuries based on the revised AAST scale. Exclusion criteria for this study included patients taken immediately to the operating room without CT imaging, those with age &lt;18 years of age, and those suffering from penetrating injury or severe traumatic brain injury.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Over a 26-month period, 98 patients were identified and reviewed. Of all included patients, 30% (29/98) were incorrectly graded by the radiologist on CT imaging. Among moderate and high-grade injuries (AAST grade 3 or higher), 17 of 57 (30%) were incorrectly graded by the radiologist on CT imaging. 12 of the 17 incorrectly graded injuries were graded too low, while two were over-graded. The remaining three were not identified by a grade at all, but by a description that could not be classified into the grading system.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Formal radiologic review of blunt splenic injury frequently incorrectly grades BSI based upon the revised AAST organ injury scale. With increasing use of non-operative therapies including embolization, which rely on an organ injury grading system, accurate assessment of BSI severity is imperative. Independent surgeon review may better triage patients into the appropriate management pathway.

Nix<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>St. Luke's Hospital Plaza- Kansas City, University of Missouri in Kansas City, Trauma/CC Department, Kansas City, MO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Our institution frequently admits trauma patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. Routine ICU admissions for mild TBI may lead to an increase in hospital resource utilization. This practice has led to our trauma service developing a standardized order set for mild TBI focusing on reducing routine ICU admissions for stable patients. In cooperation with the Neurosurgery Service this protocol was implemented in May of 2019 with the goals of decreasing ICU admissions as well as improving care. The influence of this pathway on our patient&rsquo;s outcomes remains unknown. The purpose of our study is to assess the impact of the clinical pathway on patient outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective analysis of these patients admitted to our state verified level I trauma center with mild TBI was conducted. All patients had a clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, which was made in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis and procedure codes. We compared patients pre and post clinical pathway intervention. Patients with mild TBI who were admitted in 2018 and treated with the usual care were classified as &lsquo;Group 1&rsquo;. The group of patients admitted between May of 2019 and December of 2020 identified as having mild TBI and utilizing the clinical pathway were classified as &lsquo;Group 2&rdquo;. The standardized order set included floor admissions for stable patients; a follow-up head computed tomography (CT) scan 6 hours from initial scan as well as nursing neurologic checks every two hours. If follow-up CT Head and clinical exam remained unchanged, neurologic check frequency was changed to every four hours. Neurosurgery was consulted on all patients and recommendations were implemented. To assess the safety and efficacy of the observation order set, numerous outcome measures were analyzed, which include ICU admission, hospital length of stay, need for surgical intervention, and adverse events at clinic follow-up visit. Continuous variables were compared using Student&rsquo;s T-test and categorical variables were compared using chi-squared test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 113 patients were included in the analysis. There were 34 patients in Group 1 that qualified for inclusion and 79 patients in Group 2. There was a significant difference noted in ICU admissions with 64.7% patients admitted to ICU in Group 1 and 12.7% of patients admitted in group 2, with a p-value of &lt;0.001. There was no difference noted in adverse events at clinic follow-up visits between the two groups. Surgical intervention was performed in 8.8% of patients in group 1 and 1.3% of patients in Group 2 (p-value: 0.046). There was no difference noted in the length of stay, with a median value of 2 days reported in both groups (p-value: 0.094). Follow-up time to repeat Head CT improved in Group 2 with an average of 6.5 hours compared to 8.0 hours in group 1, p-value of 0.001.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Following the adoption of our standardized mild TBI order set and clinical pathway we have significantly reduced ICU admissions with no impact on adverse events. We have also decreased follow-up time to repeat head CT with the use of the order set. Our data highlights the impact of our new TBI observation admission criteria on reducing hospital resource utilization specifically unnecessary ICU admissions in patients with mild TBI.

Hillman<sup>1</sup>, M. Moncure<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Missouri Kansas City School of Medicine, Department Of Medicine, Kansas City, MO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: With the onset of COVID-19, it is imperative hospital teams prepare to implement policies to allocate scarce critical care resources. The bridge between policy creation and optimal implementation is fraught with challenges, yet inefficiences cannot be afforded during a pandemic. Tabletop exercises utilize a scenario to review and test decision-making processes and existing plans. The purpose of this project aims at assessing comfort in patient traige before and after a series of written simulations and teachings. The goal is to utilize a tabletop simulation to prepare a triage team to apply policy guidelines when allocating critical care resournces during a public health emergency.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Truman Medical Center created a multi-disciplinary triage team for the triage of critically ill patients when a public health emergency creates demand for critical care resources. Members participated in a virtual 60-minute case-based tabletop simulation, which was led by a skilled facilitator. The team was asked to apply the hospital policy to various patient scenarios, after which a debriefing session occurred. The facilitators analyzed participants&#39; reflections during this time. Participants were asked to complete a pre- and posttest in which questions assessed their recall and ability to apply the policy to clinical cases.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Thirteen out of twenty-one triage team members participated in the virtual tabletop simulation. Opportunities to improve policy use and team function across three key themes emerged: policy interpretation, policy application, and policy implementation. Participants found it difficult to separate their roles as triage team members and clinicians which is important for hospital leadership to recognize and support. Pretest and posttest posttest results were unable to be compared as 18 triage team members participated in the pretest but only 3 participated in the posttest. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Advancing hospitals&#39; preparedness and response to public health emergencies is essential for patient safety and hospital functioning. Through this tabletop simulation, it was evident members of the multidisciplinary triage team found it difficult to utilize the critical care resource policy due to lack of understanding and intimate knowledge of the policy. There was increased discussion between members regarding how to apply the policy to each patient. From the simulation, the team was able to identify ways to pre-emptivly improve policy implementation. With this knowledge, hospital teams will be able to better execute their duties during a crisis time. This study demonstrates the importance of team-based exercises in preparing for public health emergencies.

Waljee<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan, Center For Health Outcomes & Policy (CHOP), Ann Arbor, MI, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department Of Surgery, Dallas, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
In recent years, price transparency for elective surgical conditions has come under increased scrutiny. However, elective care only makes up approximately 25% of hospital services and emergency services are not considered &ldquo;shoppable.&rdquo; For example, burn-injured patients require efficient transfer to specialized burn centers for resuscitation and treatment, without an opportunity to review public pricelists (chargemasters). Moreover, subsequent reconstruction and intensive care are costly and many burn patients are not privately insured. These vulnerable populations are most susceptible to high charge-to-cost ratios (or markups) as they lack the standing of insurers in negotiations. To date, however, the variation in charges in burn intensive care units (BICUs) has not been studied.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We used the 2019 and 2020 financial data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). These hospital financial reports are reported to the CMS and compiled by RAND. Data is available in calendar year and fiscal year format and updated as of August 2021. We considered any hospital that reported burn intensive care unit resource and financial data to CMS as a BICU. Our primary outcome was charge-to-cost ratio, defined as the charges to all payers compared to the Medicare-allowable costs.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 4617 hospitals, 94 reported BICU bed counts, costs, charges and revenues. The majority (58%) of BICUs are in hospitals with not-for-profit ownership, 35% in publicly owned hospitals and 7% in for-profit hospitals. The average size of a hospital with a BICU is 518 beds (range 87-1243). The average BICU size is 14.5 beds (range 2-90). Charge to cost ratios varied across 33 states from 0.9 in Maryland to 6.1 in Massachusetts (Figure 1). The average BICU inpatient charges at the hospital-level were $25 million. The average BICU costs were $7.5 million. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
There is a wide variation in markup for burn intensive care stays across states. BICUs with high mark-ups risk saddling vulnerable patients with artificially increased medical debt. Given the safety-net nature of burn care, these charges are disproportionately faced by uninsured, underinsured patients and workers compensation plans.

The use of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) has become increasingly popular as an outdoor recreational activity among people living in the United States, particularly in areas such as the southeast. There are significant risks involved with riding ATVs, especially in the pediatric population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of pediatric patients involved in ATV associated accidents.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This study is a retrospective review of 98 pediatric patients ages 15 years and younger involved in ATV accidents who were admitted to a pediatric hospital between January 2015 and December 2020. Outcomes including types of injuries sustained, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and injury severity score (ISS) which were analyzed between age groups (0-5, 6-10, and 11-15).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Mean hospital stay across all age groups was 1.7 &plusmn; 1.9 days, mean ICU stay was 3.8 &plusmn; 4.0 days, and mean injury severity score (ISS) was 5.9 &plusmn;4.8. The 11&ndash;15-year-old age group had significantly longer hospital days and higher ISS scores compared to both of the younger age groups (0-5 and 6-10 years old). There was no difference in ICU days between the age groups. Orthopedic injuries were the most common type of injury occurring in 55% of all patients, followed by head injuries in 29% of patients, and spinal fractures in 2% of patients. The most common orthopedic fracture in the 11&ndash;15-year-old group was tibia/fibula, while humerus fractures were the most common type of fracture in the 0-5- and 6-10-year age groups. Orthopedic procedures were required in 35% of all included patients. There was no statistically significant difference in types of injuries and types of fractures sustained between each group. Chest injuries, including pneumothorax, lung contusions and rib fractures, occurred most often in the older age group 11-15 years (n=65). Those who experienced chest injuries had a higher ISS, although it was not statistically significant (p=0.06) compared to those who did not have chest injuries. There was no difference in hospital or ICU length of stay in patients with chest injuries. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The results of this study demonstrate the outcomes of pediatric patients admitted for ATV accidents at a rural Appalachian pediatric hospital and provide an overviewof the most common injuries involved in this trauma mechanism. Pediatric patients ages 11-15 years of age involved in ATV accidents are at risk for longer hospital length of stay and higher ISS compared to younger age groups. Additionally, patients ages 11-15 were more susceptible to chest injuries following ATV accidents. The results of this study will be used to develop a standardized trauma protocol for management of this specific trauma mechanism in the pediatric population based on common injury patterns among each age group.

However, CPR and Advanced Care Life Support (ACLS) are now widely used to treat cardiac arrest from a variety of causes. However, little is known regarding outcomes for those who undergo multiple episodes of cardiac arrest. The purpose of this study was to assess outcomes and identify predictors of survival of patients admitted to our tertiary care hospital who underwent multiple code events.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review was performed of all patients from 2014-2018 at Parkland Memorial Hospital who had undergone CPR. Patients were identified based off the current procedural terminology code for CPR/ACLS (92950) during their in-hospital admission. Patients were excluded if they were less than 18 years of age, were considered dead on arrival or expired in the emergency department prior to admission. A code event was defined as initiation of CPR or ACLS until either declaration of death or return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The primary outcome for this study was survival to discharge. We also compared baseline characteristics of patients, reason for admission, where the first code event occurred and discharge disposition.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The overall mortality rate was 77.3%. We found notable differences in baseline characteristics and place of first code in survivors and non-survivors. No difference was found in the reason for admission among survivors and non-survivors. Patients coding once during their admission had lower in-hospital mortality rates compared to those that had multiple codes (68.9% versus 91.3%, p&lt;0.01). Subset analysis of the patients who had multiple codes revealed that multiple codes within a 24-hour period led to significantly higher in-hospital mortality rates (94.7% versus 74.4%, p&lt;0.01). Variables associated with in-hospital mortality included body mass index (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.13-2.55, p=0.01), female sex (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.14-5.47, p=0.03), underlying arrhythmia (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.85, p=0.03), diabetes mellitus (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.81, p=0.01), multiple code events within 24 hours (OR 51.17, 95% CI 8.50-347.80, p&lt;0.01), being placed DNR/DNI during the admission (OR 6.53, 95% CI 6.53-83.35, p&lt;0.01), and having a first code event in the emergency room (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.04, p&lt;0.01) or outside of the hospital (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.04-0.99, p=0.04). There was no difference in one-year survival between those that coded multiple times versus one time (25.2% versus 40.9%, p=0.19). Those who were discharged home were more likely to survive at one-year compared to those who required a non-home discharge (79.0% versus 55.6%, p=0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Having multiple code events within the same admission is a significant risk factor for in-hospital mortality; specifically, if they are within 24 hours of each other. These data should help guide goals of care discussions for critically ill patients.

We studied the context, timing, and location of pediatric firearm injuries to better target injury prevention efforts to the settings in which these injuries are most likely to occur. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted an IRB approved retrospective analysis of firearm injuries among school-age children (age 5-18) using the 2019 National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) dataset. Firearm injuries were identified based on ICD-10 codes. Patient demographics, location and timing of injury, injury intent, patient acuity, and number of injured patients were characterized. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 4,764 firearm injuries in school-age children during 2019. Firearm injuries were more common in male patients and in urban areas. Assault was the most common cause of injury (53.8%) followed by unintentional discharge (12.1%) and intentional self-inflicted injuries (6.1%). Firearm injuries were more common during after-school hours, with the highest frequency of injuries occurring between 8 pm and midnight. The most common location of injury was in a private residence (51.5%), followed by a street (23.8%). Only 1.7% of firearm injuries occurred in a school (Table 1). Even during school hours, pediatric firearm injuries were more likely to occur in a private residence (51.6%) or on a street (19.9%) than in a school (6.95%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Firearm injuries among school-age children occur primarily outside of school settings. Although school shootings are tragedies that deserve attention, injury prevention efforts should also be targeted to the times and locations where pediatric firearm injuries occur most frequently. Reduction in truancy and expansion of after-school programs may be effective approaches to reducing firearm injuries among school-age children.

Haines<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Harvard Kennedy School, Cambridge, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Studying firearm-related mortalities has become more important due to increased interest in reducing preventable firearm violence, injuries, and deaths in the US. However, few studies investigate the relationship with firearm laws and firearm deaths. This study aims to determine the relationship between firearm laws and assault deaths with firearms.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This retrospective cohort study used public data from the CDC Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER) on decedents age 18 years or older who died from assaults with firearms (X93-X95) between 2009-2018 in all 50 states and Washington DC. The outcomes were the rate of mortalities per 100,000 from assault deaths with all firearms, with handguns only, with rifles, shotguns, or large firearms only, or with other or unspecified firearms by state. Factors of interest included presence of universal background check law for private sales of handguns or long guns, wait times for handguns or long guns, assault handgun or rifle bans, &ldquo;Saturday night special&rdquo; bans, prohibitions of firearm ownership for those with domestic violence restraining orders or for mental health reasons, and &ldquo;stand your ground&rdquo; laws. Welch&rsquo;s t-tests were performed to compare the mean mortality rate per 100,000 in states with each firearm law to the mean rate in states without each law. States that instituted a specific firearm law after 2009 and before 2018 were excluded from analysis for that law.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 114,945 deaths from assaults with firearms from 2009-2018. States with &ldquo;stand your ground&rdquo; laws had higher assault mortality rates from all firearms and from other or unspecified firearms than states without &ldquo;stand your ground&rdquo; laws (p=0.026; p=0.023). States with background checks for private sales of handguns and long guns had lower assault mortality rates from handguns and rifles, shotguns, and large firearms, respectively, than states without either law (p=0.019; p=0.030). States that require wait times upon purchasing long guns, ban assault rifles, and ban &ldquo;Saturday night specials&rdquo; have lower assault mortalities from rifles, shotguns, and large firearms that states without these laws (p=0.044; p=0.042; p=0.033).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Certain firearm laws are associated with differences in firearm assault mortality rates. The association of &ldquo;stand your ground&rdquo; laws with higher rates of firearm mortalities is particularly alarming and warrants further study to evaluate the underlying causes driving these higher rates of mortalities. However, the lack of association between firearm laws and rates of assault mortalities with unspecified firearms is concerning. Better data collection on firearm-related mortalities is needed to create firearm laws that will reduce these preventable gun deaths.

Palacio<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Valley Health System / McAllen Medical Center, Trauma, McAllen, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
In 2019 the United States had 3.96-gun related deaths per 100,000 people, placing the country at the 32nd-highest rate of deaths from gun violence in the world. Gun related mortality rate in the USA surpassed other developed countries. Currently, there is no literature that identifies injury patterns or weapon types used in suicides compared to homicides. This study hypothesizes that injury patterns, weapon type, and mortality differ between intentional self-harm (suicide group) as opposed to harm by others (homicide group).
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The National Trauma Database (NDTB) was queried from January 2017 to December 2019. All firearm related injuries were included, and weapon type was abstracted. Differences between homicide and intentional self-harm groups by sex, age, race, and injury severity were compared using a Mann-Whitney test for numerical data and Fisher&rsquo;s exact test for categorical data. Logistic regressions were used to determine the ways that location and specifics of injury, and drugs in system were associated with intentional self-harm as opposed to harm by others. The association between weapon type and mortality relative to intentional self-harm as opposed to harm by others was assessed in Fisher&rsquo;s exact tests. Significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
100,031 homicide and 11,714 suicide subjects met inclusion criteria, results in Table 1. Homicides were mostly assault victims (97.6%), male (88%), black (62%), more severe injury (ISS 20.73) and median age 20 years old (IQR 14 - 30), p&lt;0.01. Suicides were mostly male (82%), white (79%), less severe injury (ISS 12.07), and median age of 36 years old (IQR 19 - 54), p&lt;0.01. Handguns were used in 38% (24,961) of homicides vs 66% (5,246) of suicides, p&lt;0.001 in Table 1. Suicide group had 7.9 and 1.8 higher odds of head/neck or face injuries abdominal or pelvic contents (OR=0.7), extremities or pelvic girdle (OR=0.4), or external areas (OR=0.4). The suicide group had greater odds of using antidepressant medications (barbiturates OR=3.9, benzodiazepines OR=2.3, tricyclines OR=2.7) than the homicide group, which had higher odds of recreational drug use (cocaine OR=0.8, ecstasy OR=0.3, opioids OR=0.8, phencyclidine OR=0.5, or cannabinoids OR=0.6. Mortality rate was higher for suicide group (44.8%; 95% confidence interval: 43.9%, 45.7%) compared to the homicide group (11.5%; 11.3%, 11.7%).
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Intentional self-harm had higher mortality, more severe injuries, and more head/neck/facial injuries than harm by others. Majority of suicides were with handguns. Both groups were predominantly male; however, suicides had higher anti-depressant use and majority white compared to higher recreational drug use and majority black in homicides.

Jansen<sup>1</sup>, J. B. Holcomb<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Division Of Trauma And Acute Care Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Prior randomized controlled trial data show that prehospital blood product resuscitation after injury significantly decreases the risk of mortality. We have previously reported that only 0.67% of potentially eligible trauma patients receive blood products prehospital. However, the number of patients who may potentially benefit from this life saving intervention is currently unknown. This knowledge is important to understand the scalability of prehospital blood product use. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the number of patients who may potentially benefit from prehospital blood product resuscitation after injury in the United States.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We used data from the National Emergency Medical Services Information System 2019 (NEMSIS). The NEMSIS is the largest aggregation of voluntarily submitted EMS data in the United States, containing over 34 million incidents reported by more than 10,000 EMS agencies across 47 states/territories. It captures an estimated 91% of all trauma-related 911 calls. We identified all patients aged &ge;16 years with blunt and/or penetrating injuries and a systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;90mmHg. Patient demographic, injury details and outcomes were analyzed descriptively. The number of hypotensive patients transported to the hospital by 1) air-ambulances and 2) ground-ambulances were estimated.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The NEMSIS 2019 dataset included 4.5 million trauma activations of whom 3.7 million were &ge;16 years of age with blunt and/or penetrating injuries. Among this latter group, 89,391 (2%) patients were found to be hypotensive. Of these, 3,863 (4%) died pre-hospital and 73,914 (83%) were transported to the hospital. A total of 68,369 (93%) of patients were transported via ground-ambulance and 3,633 (5%) via air-ambulance.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
A substantial number of patients may potentially benefit from prehospital blood product resuscitation after injury in the United States each year.

Both sets of professionals have duties to protect patient health, patient rights, and public health, however the balance of these duties may be at odds. During investigation, LE presence may compromise patient privacy and create legal and ethical dilemmas for health care providers. The purpose of this study is to conduct a nationwide survey of hospital-based violence intervention programs (HVIPs) to assess the existence and effectiveness of hospital policies related to LE activity.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A nationwide survey was designed and electronically distributed using Qualtrics software to the 35 HVIPs that form the Health Alliance for Violence Intervention. Data regarding respondent affiliation and position, demographics, and the existence and effectiveness of policies related to LE activity in the hospital were collected. Follow-up video interviews were conducted by trained research investigators using a questionnaire approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Respondents from 32 of the 35 HVIPs completed the survey (91%), and 22 interviews (63%) have been conducted to date. There were varying levels of knowledge regarding the existence of and familiarity with hospital policies related to police activity. Only 39% of respondents knew policies existed and were familiar with them. The majority of respondents either knew policies existed but could not recite them (27%) or were unsure if policies existed (29%). When asked if existing policies were effective, respondents indicated policies were very effective (35%), somewhat effective (23%), not effective (18%), or unsure/prefer not to answer (21%). Half of all respondents believed their participants&rsquo; civil rights were violated by police.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Unclear or inadequate policies relating to LE activity may jeopardize the health and privacy of victims of violence. The majority of representatives of hospital-based violence intervention programs across the country did not have specific knowledge of policies relating to law enforcement activity in their hospitals. Although we reached the majority of registered HVIPs nationwide, limitations of this work include a small sample size and potential for reporting bias. Our results suggest that the biggest void in policy knowledge was directly related to patient privacy protection. Despite the presence of policies, lack of effectiveness and rights violations are still perceived issues. Development and implementation of standardized policies and education of both healthcare workers and LE could strengthen patient rights protection in the hospital.

Trauma centers (TCs) are a critical public resource. As a region&rsquo;s population grows additional TCs are often designated. While it may seem intuitive that these centers should be strategically deployed, there exists little evidence on the ideal deployment.

In this investigation, we describe the characteristics and trends of the motorcycle crash fatality rate (MCCFR) over a decade of trauma system expansion.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective review of all motorcycle crashes transported to medical care in a county of 2.7 million people covering a 2,431 mi<sup>2 </sup>area over a 10-year period were examined. The region was divided geographically into North and South based on trauma center catchment. Descriptive statistics with chi-square test comparison was used to describe the MCCFR for the county and divided regions over a decade.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
At the beginning of the study period, the county was covered by a single level 1 academic TC in the Northern region. The Southern region added a level 2 TC in 2011, and another level 2 TC in 2015. The Northern region added a level 2 TC in 2015. There was a 33% increase in total crashes from 1157 to 1542. The MCCFR for the entire county remained unchanged during the decade of expansion with a fatality rate from 2.38% to 2.83% (P=0.362). The Southern region saw an increasing trend in MCCFR during the 2009 to 2015 time from 2.1% to 4.6% (P=0.119) and a significant decrease from 2015 to 2019 from 4.6% to 1.14% (P= 0.016). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
During the study period, mortality trends increased in the Southern region with the addition of one TC but declined after the addition of a second. A possible explanation for these findings may indicate an initial learning curve in TC deployment. Local outcomes should continue to be monitored during trauma system expansion. Additional investigations into optimal trauma system design are needed.

In Uganda, intentional injuries contribute to a large burden of trauma after road traffic crash, however there is paucity of data on assault related injury severity and their treatment outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine the severity and factors associated with thirty-day mortality of assault attributable injuries at two tertiary hospitals in Uganda.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Prospective observational cohort study of 140 consecutive patients with history of assault (Ethical clearance No.UG-REC- 023/2021-17). We used the Kampala Trauma Score (KTSII) to assess injury severity, coded as mild (9-10), moderate (7-8) or severe (&le;6). The main outcome was mortality after 30 days from time of arrival at the trauma units. Other predictor variables of interest included the specific body part injured, neck strangulation, type of injury, interval from injury to hospitalization, who accompanied the patient to the hospital, whether there was alcohol intoxication at time of incidence and if a weapon was used in the assault process. Using Stata Version.17.0 (StataCorp, TX, USA), Firth&rsquo;s logistic regression analyses for rare cases and odds ratios (OR) were computed at 95% confidence interval, regarding p&lt;0.05 as statistically significant.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Mean age was 29.98 years&plusmn;12.76 SD and majority were unemployed 67.1% (n=94). Males were overrepresented 77.4% (n=108). Majority of assault incidents occurred on the streets 35.7% (n=50) and homes 30% (n=42) in urban areas 50.7% (n=71). A weapon was used during the assault in 80% (n=112) of the cases and the use of a sharp object was the most common 42.86% (n=48). Nearly half of the patients were multiply injured 49.0% (n=68) and 43.6% (n=61) had consumed alcohol at the time of injury. Majority of cases required surgery 84.3% (n=118). Mortality occurred in 5.7% (n=8) of patients. The Kampala Trauma Score was moderate 20.7% (n=29) and severe in 35.0% (n=49) of the cases respectively. Factors significantly associated with mortality at 30 days were: a severe Kampala Trauma Score [OR = 95.02, 95% CI (4.32, 2091.31); P=0.004), where hot water or paraffin were used [OR = 18.60, 95% (2.13-162.28); P=0.008] and pelvic injuries [OR = 88.29, 95% CI (0.97-8030.08)]. Least likely to die were those who underwent surgery [OR = 0.16, 95% CI (0.04-0.65); P=0.010] or sustained cuts and soft tissue injuries [OR = 0.18, 95% CI (0.04-0.89); P=0.036].


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Severe injuries due to assault occur in 35% of cases and are associated with higher mortality. In our settings, mortality was higher with conservative treatment as opposed to operative intervention. The Kampala Trauma Score II was a good predictor of injury severity and mortality in this patient population and could be used by triaging teams in remote settings.

Mouch<sup>1</sup>, Y. M. Wong<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Wright State University, Department Of Surgery, Dayton, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Recent studies suggest that enteral nutrition (EN) alone may be adequate as stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP), although these were mostly conducted in medical ICU where trauma patients with multiple risk factors, such as traumatic brain injury, major burns, and coagulopathy, may be excluded. We evaluated the relationship between EN and the rate of clinically significant gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) with or without SUP in the trauma ICU population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective chart review of all trauma patients over age 18 who were admitted to our trauma ICU from January to December 2019 and were started on EN. Those who were on a histamine-2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitor at home, intolerant to these therapies, had active GIB on admission, and brain dead were excluded. Patient characteristics, complications, and outcomes were collected. Patients who received SUP were compared to those without. Results are presented as median with interquartile range (IQR) or percentages. Mann-Whitney U and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis. A p value &lt; 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 372 patients were included in the study with 249 receiving SUP. Basic patient characteristics were similar between the two groups. Only two patients experienced clinically significant GIB, defined as evidence of bleeding with transfusion requirements and/or endoscopic or surgical intervention, both of whom received SUP. The group that received SUP also had significantly higher injury severity score (ISS) (p = 0.03), longer ICU length of stay (LOS) (p &lt; 0.00001), and worse 30-day mortality (p = 0.0026). The overall C. difficile infection rate was low with only one patient in the SUP group. The rate of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in the SUP group was more than double that of the other group, although it was not statistically significant (p = 0.11).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our study did not show any significant difference in the incidence of GIB with or without SUP while patients were on feeding, which may suggest a protective effect of EN against the development of stress ulcer. Additionally, as suggested by previous studies, routine prophylaxis against stress ulcer may worsen certain clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, larger randomized studies are needed to fully assess the relationship between EN and the prevention of clinically significant GIB.

Spirtos<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Nevada, Las Vegas, School Of Medicine, Las Vegas, NV, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Women's Cancer Center of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Diverticulitis is an intestinal disorder where colonic outpouchings due to increased intraluminal pressure become infected. Complex diverticulitis occurs when an abscess or fistula develops. Treatment often includes surgical resection of the portion of the affected bowel with fistula repair and bowel anastomosis. These procedures can be done in multiple stages including separate surgeries for resection and anastomosis or the anastomosis can occur with the resection. These procedures can be performed using minimally invasive (MIS) techniques or open. This study investigates the outcomes associated with the treatment of complicated diverticulitis and related fistula utilizing robotic-assisted primary colon resection and diverting loop ileostomy (RAPID 2-Stage).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This was a retrospective cohort study of 20 patients with Hinchey Stage II-IV diverticulitis that underwent RAPID 2- Stage procedure. Outcomes associated with the RAPID 2-Stage were compared to other procedures utilizing laparotomy or MIS techniques including: primary colon resection and anastomosis without diversion; colon resection with end-colostomy and Hartmann&rsquo;s pouch; and other robotic-assisted or laparoscopic surgical procedures. A meta-analysis of outcome variables including length of stay (days), operative time (minutes), and blood loss (mL) were compared (95% confidence intervals (CI)). To establish the validity of comparing the outcomes associated with the RAPID 2-Stage procedure with the published results associated with other procedures, the 95% confidence intervals of the raw data associated with RAPID 2-Stage procedure were compared to 95% confidence intervals of bootstrap samples.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The patients undergoing RAPID 2-Stage procedures tended to have shorter hospital stays than those receiving either the Hartmann or Primary Anastomosis procedures (mean of 5.05 and CI [3.9-6.2]). The 95% CI for blood loss (mL) associated with the RAPID 2-Stage procedure was also less than the Hartmann or Primary Anastomosis procedures and similar to robotic-assisted hysterectomy procedures (mean of 78.5 mL and CI [59.62mL-97.34mL]). There were three studies utilizing a Hartmann&rsquo;s procedure and similarly three studies utilizing primary resection with anastomosis with 95% CI for operative time that overlapped with the CI associated with the RAPID 2-Stage procedure, while the remainder of the procedures included in the meta-analysis had 95% CI associated with longer operative times (mean of 139.95 minutes and CI [116.54 min-163.36 min]). There was one complication of anastomotic leak in a patient.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The RAPID 2-Stage procedure is associated with a shorter hospital stay and decreased blood loss compared to Hartmann and Primary Anastomosis procedures. Trends established by this analysis identified benefits associated with this approach, while also demonstrating adverse events associated with this undertaking were insignificant.

Previous studies have demonstrated that laparoscopic colectomy is a safe and effective management strategy. The hypothesis of this study was to assess the outcome of laparoscopic, robot-assisted colectomy for colonic polyps not suitable for endoscopic resection. A second aim was to correlate suspicious endoscopic characteristics with operative findings to better understand when definitive colectomy should be pursued more expediently.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective cohort study of fifty-seven patients from 2016 to 2021 met inclusion criteria. Data were gathered on demographics, operative details, and pathologic results.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our cohort was a female majority (56%), mean age of 64 &plusmn; 11 years, BMI of 29 &plusmn; 6. Polyp location was most commonly in the cecum (26%) with a size of 4 &plusmn; 1.5 cm requiring right colectomy (61%). There were zero intraoperative complications but five conversions to open. There were sixteen postoperative complications; the most serious complications resulted from open surgery and the majority of postoperative ileus resulted from laparoscopic surgery (71.4%). The mean length of stay was 3 &plusmn; 4.1 day, which was significantly decreased compared to open surgery (p&lt;0.0005). Final pathology identified adenocarcinoma in 28% of cases, most commonly found to be TisN0 (22.8%) with negative margins (84%). No significant differences were found between age or gender and pathology (p=0.4087 and p=0.5915, respectively).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study represents the largest case series analyzed to date regarding the outcome of unresectable polyps. Twenty-eight percent of unresectable colonic polyps were found to be associated with cancer, which is a higher rate than previously reported in the literature (20%). Earlier pursuit of formal oncologic colectomy should be considered when presented with the aforementioned characteristics.

Xipoleas<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Mount Sinai School Of Medicine, Department Of Surgery At Mount Sinai South Nassau, New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Pilonidal disease is a condition that affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue most commonly in the sacrococcygeal region in the area of the gluteal cleft and can develop into a draining sinus, cyst, or abscess. Treatment of pilonidal disease continues to pose a challenge for clinicians due to the variety of clinical presentations and rate of recurrence. In order to have resolution of disease the entirety of the involved tissue, including all pits and sinus tracts, must be removed. Recurrence rates are described between 8-50% depending on the treatment utilized. Many different treatment strategies exist for pilonidal disease but there is no consensus for the preferred treatment management strategy; the clinician must balance the extent of excision and deformity created against chance of recurrence or wound infection rate. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a single institution observational study looking at a set of retrospectively collected data. Patient data was collected for all patients who underwent pilonidal disease resection utilizing the Pilonidal Disease Bundle over a three year period. The Pilonidal Disease Bundle included intraoperative and postoperative components designed to decrease recurrence rate and wound infection while allowing primary closure. Patient demographics were examined as were outcome measures including length of surgery, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, time to return to work or school, need for readmission or reoperation, homecare service requirements, and any intraoperative or postoperative complications.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty patients with pilonidal disease were managed using the Pilonidal Disease Bundle. The average patient age was 24 and 85% of patients were male. Surgery lasted on average 72 minutes, there were no major intraoperative or postoperative complications, and estimated blood loss was on average 15cc. All but two patients were ambulatory cases who were discharged the same day. There were no instances of wound infections, seroma, or hematomas. All patients returned to work or school within two weeks and none needed home healthcare services or required narcotics postoperatively. All had small (&lt;5%) wound dehiscence that healed without extra wound care needs. Only one of twenty patients had recurrence requiring return to OR.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: When our Pilonidal Disease Bundle was implemented, we observed a rate of recurrence lower than the reported rates in the literature while still allowing complete resection of pilonidal disease with primary closure. In addition, patients had minimal postoperative pain and wound care needs, allowing prompt return to activities of daily living including school and work.

Lack of access to technology or broadband connection contributes to the digital divide, but additional factors at the provider-level may contribute. We aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to patient use of telemedicine with a focus on trust and the patient-provider relationship.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients 18 years and older who were seen via telemedicine at a colorectal surgery clinic at a high-volume, tertiary care academic center were contacted for participation in this study. Patient demographics including age at surgery, race, sex, diagnosis, and home ZIP code were recorded. Patient health literacy was evaluated using the BRIEF Health Literacy Screening Tool. The Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale (WFPTS) was used to measure patient trust in providers. Semi-structured interviews based on developed guides explored barriers and facilitators to telemedicine use. Interviews were recorded and transcribed using Landmark. Qualitative analysis was conducted using NVivo12 software. Inductive thematic analysis was used to code each transcript, allowing each team member to identify themes and patterns in an iterative manner. Each coder reviewed the transcript independently, convening after initial review for discussion.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 29 participants, 52% identified as female, 67% White, 30% Black, and 4% Latino, which closely mirrors the racial demographics of the study region. 33.3% of patients had limited health literacy with a mean BRIEF score of 17.6 (SD 3.33). The WFPTS scale ranged from 44 to 50 (mean 48, SD 2.4), suggesting a high level of trust in providers. Three major themes were identified as important with respect to trust during telemedicine visits: trust in providers, trust in the institution, and trust in the surgical process. Of these, provider-level trust appeared to most influence patient trust in telemedicine. Four recurring sub-themes were identified as provider-level factors most critical to a patient&rsquo;s trust in telemedicine &ndash; surgeon reputation, duration of the patient encounter, established expectations at the onset of care, and surgeon confidence. Within the sub-theme of surgeon reputation, interpersonal characteristics such as patience, attentiveness, and transparency were key elements of building patient trust in telemedicine.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Providers are critical to establishing patient trust which influences trust in telemedicine. To improve patient trust and engagement, providers and healthcare systems should build and integrate interventions that enhance communication and interpersonal skills.

Kuo<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of South Florida College Of Medicine, Tampa, FL, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Loyola University Chicago Stritch School Of Medicine, Maywood, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Robotic surgery is an appealing option for both surgeons and their patients. The question of introduction and early adoption of new surgical technology such as robotics with the potential link to increased procedure specific volume has not been previously addressed. Within the generic world of business philosophy, it is thought that a narrow differentiation focus is a strategy for competitive advantage. Our hypothesis is that hospital adoption of robotic technology increases the total volume of specific procedures as compared to non-robotic hospitals.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The 2010-2020 Florida Agency for Health Care Administration Inpatient data was queried for Open, Laparoscopic and Robotic Colectomy, Lobectomy, Gastric Bypass, and Antireflux procedures. ICD9 and ICD10 codes were used to capture the three procedure types. Difference in difference method, based on Poisson regression, was used to evaluate the impact of robotic technology on the total procedure specific volume of robotic hospitals versus non-robotic hospitals, before and after adopting the robotic technology. Incident Rate Ratios- IRR, from the difference in difference analysis determined the significance of robotic technology. Patient demographics were evaluated using chi square test; p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were a total of 291,826 procedures performed at 217 hospitals, 151 of which had robotic capabilities. Robotic hospitals experienced 37% increase in total volume due to robotic technology (IRR 1.37, p &lt;0.05), and it was consistent for each procedure separately except for Antireflux procedures. IRR for Colectomy, Lobectomy, Gastric Bypass and Antireflux procedures were 1.38,1.11,1.73 and 0.95, respectively. (See Table 1.) Robotic procedures had significantly higher charges for medical/surgical supplies, however the mean length of stay for Robotic procedures was significantly shorter than that of Laparoscopic and Open cases leading to decreased room and board charges.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Hospital adoption of robotic technology significantly increases the overall surgical volume at that hospital for select procedures. Hospitals should consider the benefits of introducing robotic technology which leads to higher case volume and decreased length of stay benefitting both hospital systems and patients.

Although opioid-free bariatric surgery can mitigate these risks, little is known about patient or surgeon factors that may impact the utilization of opioid-free practices and subsequent postoperative outcomes.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using a statewide bariatric-specific data registry, we identified all patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery between 2017 and 2021 who also had data on the number and type of opioids prescribed within the first 30 days following surgery (n=30,367). Baseline patient characteristics, risk-adjusted 30-day complication rates, and emergency room (ER) visits were compared between patients who were and were not prescribed opioids within the 30 days after surgery. Surgeon characteristics were also compared between high and low utilizers of opioid-free surgery. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 4,240 (14.0%) patients underwent opioid-free bariatric surgery. Independent predictors of opioid-free surgery included white race (OR=1.19; 95% CI, 1.03-1.37, p=0.0171) and undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (OR=1.24; 95% CI 1.11-1.39, p=0.0002). There was no significant difference in the rate of ER visits between groups. However, patients receiving opioids postoperatively had higher complication rates (9.7% vs 7.2%, p=0.0190). Surgeons in the highest quartile for opioid-free surgery (n=26) had a mean utilization of 41.1% and were more likely to operate at a teaching hospital (80.8% vs 44.0%, p=0.0066) when compared to surgeons in the lowest quartile (n=25), which had a mean utilization of 0.6%. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Opioid-free bariatric surgery is common and does not increase the rate of ER visits postoperatively. However, there is variation in utilization that may be due to patient-specific factors and surgeon-specific preferences. Additional evaluation of surgeon-specific practices within the context of diverse patient populations may highlight areas for improvement to further reduce the rate of opioid use after bariatric surgery.

Hughes<sup>1</sup>, E. Seitelman<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Mount Sinai School Of Medicine, Department Of Surgery At Mount Sinai South Nassau, Oceanside, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Surgical site infections (SSI) are a well-known and commonly encountered complication of surgical procedures. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that SSIs account for 31% of all healthcare-associated infections. Surgical procedures involving the colon and rectum are especially notorious for their association with infection. Several acute-care centers have adopted a &#39;Colon Bundle&#39; protocol to address SSI rates and have reported varying degrees of success. The CDCs National Health and Safety Network (NHSN) has detailed guidelines for tracking and reporting SSIs and published guidelines for their prevention.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: NHSN&rsquo;s Surveillance for SSI Events reporting system was used to identify and prospectively track SSIs over the period of 2 years for all surgical cases. A multidisciplinary team was assembled to develop and implement a SSI prevention &#39;Colon Bundle&#39; protocol. This bundle included pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative care guidelines both evidence-based and best-practice. Rates of SSIs prior to implementation were compared to post-implementation infection rates.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: SSI rates for the year prior to implementation of the bundle was recorded at 10.71% (12 of 112 cases). The following year after implementation of the bundle the infection rate was recorded at 3.13% (3 of 96 cases). This difference was statstically significant (X<sup>2</sup>= 4.45, p=0.03).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Implementation of a SSI-prevention &#39;Colon Bundle&#39; significantly decreased the rate of SSIs in elective colorectal cases performed at a single center. This study is not able to identify specific components of the bundle that contributed to the improved infection rates, but does demonstrate that the bundle as a whole had a significant effect on SSI rates.

Locke<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The majority of programs aimed to increase living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) address transplant candidates&rsquo; needs, rather than those of potential donors. The Living Donor Navigator (LDN) Program is the first of its kind to simultaneously address candidate concerns by training friends or family to advocate on the candidate&rsquo;s behalf, and donor concerns using lay navigators to increase comfort throughout the donation process. The purpose of this analysis was to explore the ways in which a program can attend to potential donors&rsquo; needs and help them progress toward living kidney donation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Donors screened on behalf of candidates who participated in the LDN Program between 04/2017-01/2020 were purposively sampled. Individual interviews were conducted virtually among 7 participants, audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Concepts pertaining to the central question (How can a program like the LDN Program help potential donors progress on their journeys to living kidney donation while respecting their values, honoring who they are, and meeting them where they are at?) were extracted for use in thematic analyses performed using an inductive approach.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 7 participants, 43% had completed the donation process, and 71% also served as advocates in the LDN Program. The majority were female (86%), white (57%), younger than 51 years old (57%), and lived more than 1 hour driving distance from the transplant center (57%). Education levels ranged from high school to doctoral degrees. Six themes emerged in our analyses: one pertained to the priorities that guided participants&rsquo; decisions to pursue living kidney donation, while five characterized differing, though interrelated ways in which LDKT programs can address potential donors&rsquo; concerns and increase comfort during the donation process. Figure 1 depicts a conceptual framework of the relationships between the themes of Individual Considerations to Pursue Living Donation, Education, Community of Support, Communication, Compassionate Care, and Convenience as they relate to the stepwise process of living kidney donation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The resultant conceptual framework describes potential donors&rsquo; considerations and priorities in the decision to become a living kidney donor, and highlights opportunities for programmatic intervention to support potential donors throughout the evaluation and donation process. This framework will not only serve as the foundation for LDN Program refinement, but may also guide future program development nationally to better serve potential living kidney donors.

As telehealth use increases in surgery, communication increasingly relies on verbal conversation. Few studies have characterized the use and potential negative impact of medical jargon in telehealth encounters. This study therefore aimed to characterize the use of medical jargon in patient-surgeon telehealth encounters and to identify opportunities for improvement.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients undergoing outpatient telehealth encounters at a single-institution in a colorectal surgery clinic (June to July 2020) were recruited to this study. Patient demographics were recorded in addition to health literacy as measured by the Brief Health Literacy Screening Tool (BRIEF). All encounters were audio-recorded and transcribed with time stamps. Primary outcomes included percent of medical jargon used and percent of medical jargon explained. Percent of medical jargon used was defined as total number of medical jargon words by surgeon divided by total words used by the surgeon. Medical jargon was measured by cross-indexing a surgeon&rsquo;s speech with a jargon library from Stedman&rsquo;s Medical Dictionary. Percent of medical jargon explained was defined as total number of jargon words counted that were explained by the surgeon divided by total jargon words spoken by the surgeon. Secondary outcomes included length of visit (LOV), patient-surgeon exchanges (PSE) and time to interruption (TTI). PSE were defined as any instance in which conversation shifted from the surgeon speaking to the patient speaking. TTI was defined as the number of seconds passed in the conversation before the surgeon first interrupted the patient. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. The mean age was 49.5 years (SD 12.7) and 66.7% were female. Health literacy levels were adequate (11 patients, 45.8%), marginal (10 patients, 41.7%) and low (3 patient, 12.5%). Average percent medical jargon used was 7.3% (SD 2.2) and average percent medical jargon explained was 3.8% (SD 3.5). Overall average LOV was 10 minutes and 3 seconds (SD 6 minutes and 40 seconds) among all surgeons (N=24). Average PSE was 55.8 (SD 31.25). First interruptions were more likely in the beginning of conversations: average TTI was 46.9 seconds (SD 35.1 seconds). Analysis demonstrated percent of jargon used in a conversation and PSE were correlated (R= 0.536, p=0.007); additionally, percent jargon explained was positively correlated with PSE (R=0.489, p=0.0152). Medical jargon did not vary by patient-reported health literacy.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study demonstrates that maximizing patient-surgeon exchanges may enhance the clarity of a telehealth conversation. These exchanges may be fostered by allowing patients greater opportunity to speak, ask questions, and raise concerns. These actions may mitigate the negative impact of medical jargon and improve understanding for patients of all health literacy levels.

Fry<sup>1</sup>, J. Dimick<sup>1</sup>, D. A. Telem<sup>1</sup>, A. Ehlers<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The use of robotics for hernia repair has exploded over the last decade, despite the increased cost and questionable change in outcomes compared to traditional laparoscopic technique. However, there is variability in adoption of the technology, and it is unclear when and how surgeons choose to use the robotic technique. The unknown factors that drive the use of this high-resource technology are unable to be captured by traditional quantitative methods. Within this context, we sought to qualitatively explore surgeon motivations for use of robotic surgery in abdominal wall hernia repair. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Twenty-one surgeons participating in the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) were purposively sampled for participation in the study. Semi-structured interviews captured motivating factors for choice of approach for hernia repair. Surgeons were presented with clinical vignettes and open-ended questions to capture motivating factors for approach. Qualitative descriptive analysis was conducted using MaxQDA Plus 2020.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 21 participants, 17 (81%) were men, with a median (IQR) age of 47 (45-54). Qualitative analysis identified 3 dominant themes that characterized surgeon motivation for use of robotic approaches for hernia repair: Availability, Ease of Use and Market Factors. Surgeons reported that robotic use was heavily influenced by availability of the technology and if it was unavailable, they would default to a different approach rather than delay hernia repair. Surgeons also expressed that a robotic approach was associated with an increase in their personal physical comfort, allowing for improved approaches to difficult surgical techniques and improved ergonomics. Finally, surgeons agreed that the hospital system promotion of the robot to both patients and providers increased their desire to utilize the technology. Illustrative quotes for each theme are outlined in Table 1.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this study, we found that adoption of robotic hernia repair is driven by surgeon perceptions about availability, comfort, and market competition, rather than patient or hernia characteristics. While surgeons thought that the robot was beneficial, the discretionary and variable use of this technology (i.e., willingness to use other approaches rather than delay care if the robot was unavailable) may indicate that the robotic technology is viewed as a useful but nonessential resource. Future work will quantitatively examine the patient factors that drive robotic utilization, to further assess the value and optimal utilization of robotic technology.

Minimally invasive fundoplication is both safe and effective in treating patients with severe GERD and is now considered standard of care procedure. Literature shows that minimally invasive procedures is associated with shorter length of stay, early and late complications. Our previous studies and literature has shown no difference in access to minimally invasive fundoplication between black and white patient populations. This study aims to elucidate relationship between the race and postoperative complications.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
All cases of fundoplication recorded in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database from 2012-2019 were collected. Patient demographics and preoperative, operative, and postoperative variables were recorded. A 4:1 greedy-matching propensity score algorithm was implemented to generate clinically balanced cohorts of patients of white and black self-identified race. These cohorts were then subjected to logistic regressions to evaluate the effect of race on in the postoperative complications (total effect).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Query of the ACS-NSQIP database yielded 12948 cases of fundoplication. After propensity score matching, there were 3,635 cases of Nissen fundoplication, 2,908 individuals of white self-identified race and 727 individuals of black self-identified race. Logistic regressions revealed that patients of black self-identified race in this cohort showed no statistical difference in access to minimal invasive surgery between white and self-identified black patients (OR=1.45, 95% CI=0.95669056, p = 0.0702). However, we identified that black patients were likely to have any (p&lt;0.001), and severe incidence of complication (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, black patients had higher incidence of death compared to white counterparts (p&lt;0.01). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our findings suggests that black race had higher incidence of postoperative complications in fundoplication despite no difference in access to minimally invasive procedure. The complex upstream factors that underlie the racial disparities need further research.

However, there is a lack of data comparing the three different techniques. This study sought to compare operative, perioperative, and pathological outcomes of the three approaches at a single tertiary academic institute.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients who underwent transanal excision of a rectal lesion using one of the three techniques at a single academic center were collected from a database of consecutive patients undergoing colorectal surgery (2016-2020). Patient&rsquo;s electronic medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographics and clinical diagnosis; intra-operative details such as operative time, lesion location and size; pathological diagnosis, intactness of specimen, and margins; and post-operative complications and outcomes. The three groups were compared using chi-square test for categorical variables and Kruskall-Wallis test for continuous data.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-nine patients were analyzed: 13 TEM, 6 TAMIS, 10 R-TAMIS. There were sixteen women with a median cohort age of 57 (IQR:28-81). Twenty-two (76%) patients identified as White. Patients who underwent R-TAMIS, 24.7 (23.8-28.7), had a lower BMI compared to those that underwent TEM, 29.3 (19.9-30.2), and TAMIS, 30.4 (26.6-32.9). A higher proportion of patients who underwent TAMIS (80%) and R-TAMIS (66.7%) had high grade dysplasia/invasive cancer compared to those who had TEM (41.7%). However, there was no statistically significant difference in tumor type or distance from the anal verge among the three procedures (Table 1). There were no patients who underwent R-TAMIS who had a positive margin and their procedure was performed faster than TAMIS and TEM (Table 1). There was no statistically significant difference between length of stay (p=0.6) and 30-day readmission rates (p=0.513) between the techniques. R-TAMIS (80.0%) had a larger proportion of patients who did not require any further follow up or surgery after their procedure compared to TAMIS (16.7%) and TEM (53.9%) (p=0.09). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Robotic TAMIS may have several advantages over conventional endoscopic and laparoscopic excision of transanal lesions. There was a trend towards R-TAMIS being faster and resulting in negative surgical margins, compared to the two other techniques. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and identify the role of robotic TAMIS in the care of patients with rectal lesions.

We aimed to conduct a scoping review of PROs used in lung, liver, and kidney transplant and ultimately to select appropriate PROs for longitudinal follow-up of post-transplant patients. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases for our scoping review. Our search used various combinations of the keywords: lung, liver, kidney, transplant, quality of life, activities of daily living, patient-reported outcome measures, psychometrics, and health status indicators. Articles were manually reviewed using the Rayyan database. We included all articles describing the development or usage of a PRO in the setting of lung, liver, or kidney post-transplant population. We excluded non-English articles, non-human subjects research, and articles pertaining to a pediatric population. Results from the scoping review will be summarized and sent to N = 33 surgeons, nephrologists, and hepatologists with expertise in transplant. Individual interviews will be conducted to determine the most important themes and items from the PROs for inclusion. This information will be used to select PRO items from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). A target of N = 100 lung, liver, or kidney transplant recipients will be recruited from transplant clinics at Northwestern and followed longitudinally with the customized PRO measure to be filled out online between clinic visits.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The search strategy for the scoping review resulted in N = 3970 results after non-duplicate citation screening. An additional N = 53 articles were identified as duplicates and deleted. N = 2343 articles were excluded after title/abstract screening.

Screening to date has identified the Medical Outcomes Survey Short-Form 36 (SF-36), Kidney Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (KDQoL), EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the St. George&rsquo;s Respiratory Questionnaire as the most frequently utilized questionnaires. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The current state of PRO development and usage in transplant reflects an abundant but complex array of options. This may be a useful and much-needed tool for longitudinal monitoring of post-transplant patients&rsquo; complications and quality of life.

Dageforde<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Division Of Transplant Surgery, Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Mental health is known to impact physical wellness and patient compliance with preventative and post-operative health protocols. Among high-risk obese patients, overeating, a stress-related behavior, impacts the safety and efficacy of liver transplant outcomes. As liver disease and liver transplantation pose significant psychological challenges for patients, we examined patient perception of stress and stress management while on the transplant waitlist. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An IRB-approved survey was developed for patients (age 18+) on the liver transplant waitlist at Mass General Hospital in 12/2020. The study surveyed patients on their experiences with stress, its impact on their health, and stress management. Demographic and clinical data were collected from EPIC. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 316 pre-liver transplant patients who were invited to participate in this study, 126 responded (39.9%) and 92 patients completed the survey (29.1%). Between those who completed the survey and those who did not, there was not a significant difference in age, gender, hemoglobin A1C, BMI, MELD-Na score, or the etiology of their liver disease. Those who completed the survey had significantly longer wait times compared to those with incomplete responses (1084 &plusmn; 1422 vs. 750.8 &plusmn; 796.4 days (p=0.04)). There were also significant racial differences (p=0.02) between both groups. 42.9% of patients reported a moderate amount stress, while 4.4% experienced very high, 18.7% high, 26.4% mild, and 7.7% no stress. Among those who expressed experiencing mild, moderate, and high stress, 37.5%, 69.2%, and 70.6% were actively attempting to alleviate their stress, respectively. Only 25% of patients who reported very high stress were trying to relieve their stress. Engagement in exercise was the most common reported stress management method (Fig. 1). Moderate and high-level stress were not significantly different between patients &ge;/&lt; a BMI of 30. 15.4% of patients BMI &lt; 30 and 28.9% of patients BMI &ge; 30 reported stress-eating (p=0.07). 33.0% of patients reported no impact or a minor impact of stress on health, whereas 56.0% of patients reported a moderate or major impact. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: While several patients communicated that stress affects their health, a small percentage of patients in the mild and very high-stress categories reported to engage in decreasing their stress. Patients with a BMI &ge; 30 who stress-eat pose particular concerns for meeting pre-transplant waitlist weight management and transplant conditioning standards. More work is needed to understand how stress impacts preparedness for liver transplant and post-operative recovery, as well as how the healthcare team can support patients in managing their mental health concerns.

In this abstract, we explore the effect of age on lung transplant (LT) outcomes. There exists limited single-center data assessing whether there should be an upper age limit for LTx. In analyzing our institution&rsquo;s own data bank for age-related outcomes we hope to inform future transplant practices.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We retrospectively analyzed all single and double lung transplants at our institution from Feb-2012 to Aug-2021 (n=868). Patients were grouped by age into those &lt;70 years old and those &ge;70. The two groups were compared for total ischemic time, warm ischemic time, gender, CPB time, LAS score, LOS, SLTx vs DLTx, surgical approach, and type of induction therapy. Data were analyzed using JMP Inc. (version 15.0) and p-value less than 0.05 was considered as significant.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Between all groups, ischemic time (p=0.076) and warm ischemic time (p=0.399) were not significantly different. The &lt;70 age group had more males in proportion to females (p&lt;0.01), more ethnically white (p&lt;0.001), had greater CPB times (p=0.037), greater LAS scores (p=0.009), and longer LOS (p=0.026). The &ge;70 age group had predominantly more SLTx (p&lt;0.001), favored the antero-axillary thoracotomy approach (p=0.002), and had a greater majority of simulect induction compared to campath (p&lt;0.001). Kaplan Meier analysis showed no significant 5-year survival difference in the &lt;70 years age group compared to the &ge;70 years group within both the SLTx group (p=0.054) and the DLTx group (p=0.063). Cox Regression showed survival was impacted by longer LOS (p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our results suggest that lung transplant recipients &ge;70 years old have similar survival outcomes compared to those &lt;70 for both SLTx and DLTx. This data supports the idea that lung transplantation is a safe and promising treatment option for elderly patients.

This requires a high level of coordination and regulation. However, hospital level interpretation of national organ procurement recommendations can impact the shared organ supply. Donation after circulatory death (DCD) protocols are one example of a policy that has such implementation variation. Death in DCD recoveries is defined as &ldquo;irreversible cessation of cardiac and respiratory function.&rdquo; In practice, the American Society of Transplant Surgeons recommends observing pulseless electrical activity (PEA) for a wait time of 2 minutes prior to pronouncing death, but little is known about how closely hospital DCD policies follow these recommendations and others. Henceforth, the aim of this study is to evaluate variance in DCD policy language in three important areas: formal definition of death, providers who can declare the change in status for the donor, and maximum time between extubation and expiration. We hypothesized there would be institutional variance in all three of these measures. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Content analysis of the DCD policies of all the hospitals served by a single organ procurement organization in the state of Michigan. Hospital policies were reviewed for the definition of death, the provider who would declare death, and the maximum time from extubation to expiration. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Fifty policies were included in this study. There was significant variation in how each policy defined death. Definitions of death included asystole, pulseless electrical activity, and ventricular fibrillation. Absent heart and lung sounds were included in some policies. The most common definition of death was asystole (58%, n=29). One fifth of policies did not clearly define the declaration of death (16%, n=8). Most hospitals required a physician to declare death in DCD (94%, n=47) vs a physician or his/her designee (44%, n=22). The time to expiration in the policies ranged from 60 to 120 minutes, with some hospitals having no time specification (16%, n=8). The majority of hospitals set the maximum time from extubation to expiration at 90 minutes (44%, n=22). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Death in DCD recoveries is defined as pulseless electrical activity by national recommendations, however there is wide variation in the interpretation of this recommendation. Waiting for asystole may cause delays in organ recovery and the consequent viability of these organs for transplantation. More standard guidelines are needed regarding the identity of the declaring provider and the time to expiration used in hospitals served by the same organ procurement organization.

Liver transplantation is a highly successful treatment for liver failure and disease. However, demand continues to outstrip our ability to provide transplantation as a treatment. Many patients die or become too frail for surgery before an organ becomes available; therefore, increasing the number of transplantable organs is a priority.

Many livers initially considered for transplantation are either discarded or not retrieved because of concerns about viability or logistical issues. However, these assessments can be subjective. Recent clinical trials have shown previously discarded livers might have been successfully transplanted if they had undergone machine perfusion, which allows a more objective assessment of liver quality and increases the acceptable time to transplant.

We analyzed the U.S. dataset of deceased liver donors to determine how many additional transplants would be possible if machine perfusion were available, the likely costs of their use at scale, and the potential benefits.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We identified eligible liver grafts that had not been used for transplant using the European VITTAL Trial criteria on the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients dataset between 2009 and 2019. We sequentially excluded organs with absolute donor contraindications and logistic issues such as organs that could not be tissue- or size-matched. We then used a Markov-based decision-analytic model to simulate predicted costs using cost data from the Medicare database and previously published cost-effectiveness studies.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The number of livers (including whole livers and liver segments) considered for transplantation but discarded after retrieval, or not retrieved at all, ranged from 1,751 to 2,987 per year (Median: 1844; s.d.: 372) between 2009-2019. Most grafts considered for transplantation were whole livers (0.7% being liver segments). 

Through simulating the trial criteria using the U.S. national data between the years of 2009-2019, we found a median of 39.6% (34.4-44.3%) of grafts were excluded for outright medical contraindications, 25.2% (21.5-30.0%) for logistical issues, with a resulting 28.0% (20.1-36.8%) eligible for perfusion. We found that perfusion machines could therefore have increased the number of liver transplants by an average of 383 (range 320 &ndash; 466) per year, representing a 5.6% (range 4.2-7.6%) increase in annual yield of total liver transplants.

The decision analysis model demonstrated that this technology would likely add $45,000 to the cost of the standard of care but would be predicted to reduce wait list time and achieve 6.5 QALYs at the cost of $68,600/QALY.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Machine perfusion of livers currently not considered viable for transplant could increase the number of transplantable grafts by around 5% per year and are likely to be cost-effective when compared to orthotopic transplantation alone. This would represent a significant improvement in access to this life-saving treatment.

This is criticized for increasing costs to the healthcare system, but private insurance can benefit patients through improved access to care. Therefore, understanding the impact of a higher private insurance payer mix on patient access to kidney transplantation is a priority. We hypothesized that higher private insurance payer mix is associated with higher incidence of transplant waitlisting. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective analysis was performed using the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) data and Medicare Dialysis Facility Compare data including all adult patients initiating chronic dialysis between 2013-2017 (N=374,499). Our exposure was facility payer mix&mdash;proportion of patients per center with private insurance at enrollment&mdash;measured in quartiles. The primary outcome was access to transplantation, defined as waitlisting for kidney transplant within one year of dialysis initiation. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression adjusted for patient- and facility-level characteristics. To explore the relative contribution of an individual&rsquo;s insurance vs. a facility&rsquo;s payer mix, we compared models with and without adjustment for individual insurance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Average payer mix was 17% privately insured patients per center (31% quartile 4 [Q4] vs. 5% Q1). In multivariable analysis, compared to patients at facilities in the lowest quartile of private payer mix, odds of waitlisting were higher in all other quartiles, (Q2: aOR=1.16, P&lt;0.001; Q3: aOR=1.25, P&lt;0.001; Q4: aOR=1.36, P&lt;0.001). After adjusting for individual patient insurance, payer mix remained significantly associated with outcome but with attenuated effect sizes (Q2: aOR=1.07, P=0.010; Q3: aOR=1.08, P=0.001; Q4: aOR=1.08, P=0.001). At the patient level, private insurance was associated with higher odds of waitlisting (aOR=2.16, P&lt;0.001). Patients at facilities in the upper vs. lower quartile of payer mix had significantly higher rates of one-year waitlisting (Figure: unadjusted 7.3% vs. 4.1%; adjusted 3.3% vs. 2.4%; adjusted including individual insurance 2.8% vs. 2.6%). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients in dialysis facilities with higher private payer mix are more likely to be waitlisted for transplant in the first year. This is attributable primarily to the effect of private insurance on individuals, but there is also an independent effect of high payer mix that warrants further investigation. Policies influencing dialysis reimbursement should consider the impact of both individual insurance and facility payer mix on access to kidney transplant.

The EHR is not utilized uniformly across populations by socioeconomic status and race.(3) While the portal itself is free of charge, barriers such as lack of financial means, computer access, and technologic literacy limit availability. These barriers exacerbate concurrent health care disparities in differing patient demographics. Significant variation in EHR access has been shown by age, race, and socioeconomic status in patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and heart disease (1-2, 4-5). Of note, portal use was shown to positively impact care outcomes and follow-up adherence in such patients (4-5). However, use has not been well studied in kidney transplant patients. Our project sought to evaluate how portal access differs in kidney transplant recipients by race, income, age, and gender.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A Cross-sectional study was performed on patients receiving a kidney transplant between April 2016 and May 2019 at a single institution. Inclusion criteria were all patients that received either living or deceased donor kidney transplants. Exclusion criteria were patients unable to have post-operative follow-up in the US, and those that did not obtain adequate post-operative labs for primary analysis. Patient characteristics analyzed include age, race, gender, and median household income by zip code. Portal access dates and total usage for each patient was retrieved from the Athena* EHR. Individual patient data was collected for 2 years after transplantation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 247 transplant patients were analyzed by race, income, age, and gender (Fig 1). Those who identified as black race were significantly less likely to access the portal (p-value = 0.0102). Those with median household zip code income less than $40k annually were significantly less likely to access the portal (Odds Ratio = 0.33892, p-value = 0.00637). Those aged 29-39 were significantly less likely to access the portal with 12% (p-value = 0.0206). Although statistically insignificant, patients 50-59 years old had the highest percentage of at least one portal access with 42%. No significant findings existed by gender. Study is on-going, here we present preliminary findings.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In kidney transplant recipients, statistically significant differences exist in electronic health record use based on household income and race. No significant differences were found based on gender or age. These findings should be considered in transplant outcomes and influence on patient involvement in care.

Future aims: We plan to analyze how portal use variation impacts outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. Primary outcome measures will include allograft rejection, allograft failure, and kidney function by eGFR. Secondary outcome measures will be evaluated by emergency department visits and hospital readmissions.

Zarrinpar<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Florida, College Of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Florida, Department Of Surgery, Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Studies of the outcomes of race-matching donors and recipient in solid organ transplantation have yielded mixed results. Whether race-matching affords better outcomes in graft rejection and patient survival depends on the organ(s) transplanted, as well as recipient race. The effects of race-matching in small bowel transplantation have not been recently investigated. Though it has been reported that HLA-mismatch is associated with donor-specific antibodies and chronic rejection, including a liver graft in the transplant has been associated with lower rates of rejection, possibly by allowing clearance of pre-formed donor-specific antibodies. As such, we sought to determine if race-matching and/or liver co-transplantation were associated with more favorable outcomes in small bowel transplantation.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The National UNOS STAR file database for small bowel transplantations from 2010 to 2020 was queried for transplants where the recipients and donors were Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or Asian. The transplants were then divided by whether they included a liver graft and then into race-matched or unmatched. The effects of race-matching were examined on graft survival, acute graft rejection, and graft dysfunction after 6 months and 1 year.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Race-matching is associated with longer graft survival in small bowel transplantation overall. Without a liver graft, however, there is no difference in graft survival time. With a liver graft, race-matching is further associated with lower rates of acute rejection and graft dysfunction at 1 year.

 

Specifically in Non-Hispanic Black small bowel recipients, race-matching was associated with improved graft survival if a liver was transplanted, but decreased graft survival without a liver graft. Acute rejection and dysfunction at 6 months and 1 year were no different between the groups.



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Race-matching in small bowel transplantation overall is associated with better graft survival and lower rates of rejection when a liver is included. However, in the absence of a liver graft, race-matching may be beneficial to some patients, but not in the Non-Hispanic Black population.

Ganoza<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Pittsburg, Abdominal Transplantation, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Arterial pseudoaneurysm (PA), mycotic aneurysm (MA), and arterioenteric fistulae (AF) are rarely described, late arterial complications of pancreas transplant. Presentation ranges from abdominal pain to hemodynamic collapse due to rupture or arterioenteric fistula with GI bleeding. For AF, a herald bleed is frequently missed in the diagnostic workup and the consequences are grave. Management options of these complications include endovascular and or surgical interventions, and usually requires allograft resection. We herein describe our institutional case series to better inform providers and prevent catastrophic delays in diagnosis and intervention of these late arterial complications.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a retrospective review of all pancreas transplants performed at our institution between 1997-2021. We then identified those patients who developed late arterial complications. Demographics, transplant indication, operative technique, clinical, laboratory and imaging data and outcomes were abstracted. Transplant postoperative complications, incidence of rejection, need for percutaneous biopsy, reintervention and septic complications were recorded. Presenting vital signs, symptoms, graft function and interval from transplant were captured.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Between 1997-2021, ten patients presented with late arterial complications (mean years from transplantation: 11, range 3-17). One patient presented with isolated PA, two with isolated AF, two with isolated MA and five patients had concomitant PA and AF. All patients had graft failure at the time of arterial complication. We identified graft rejection and percutaneous biopsy (60%) and early postoperative septic complications (40%) as risk factors for late arterial complications. All PA and MA occurred at the Y-graft extension. Six patients presented in hemorrhagic shock and required urgent laparotomy and graft resection. There was one mortality. Notably, all patients with AF that presented in shock had a preceding outside hospital admission with a sentinel GI bleed but were ultimately discharged from those institutions without a definitive diagnosis.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Diagnosis of late arterial complications after pancreas transplant requires high clinical suspicion, particularly among emergency medicine providers. As our results show, missed diagnoses are common and costly. Early angiographic evaluation is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. We recommend stabilization and early transfer to a tertiary care center for patients with any history of pancreas transplant presenting with any GI bleed.

Gilbert<sup>1</sup>, J. Verbesey<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Georgetown University Medical Center, Transplantation, Washington, DC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Non-directed donors (NDD), previously viewed as a program-specific asset, have been demonstrated a valuable resource that can &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; incompatible living donor (LD) transplant pairs. Recent advances in paired kidney exchange (PKE) suggest that NDD may facilitate a greater than expected number of transplants, with donors receiving additional protections via PKE participation. In 2019, the largest PKE clearinghouse in the US, the National Kidney Registry (NKR), transitioned NDD to the Family Voucher (FV) program, where LD may identify 5 family members to receive vouchers for a future transplant should they develop end-stage renal disease. An important aspect of the PKE progam is for each NDD shared to the national PKE program, an end-chain LD is allocated to the same center to assure program volumes. As a leading center in the NKR, our center performed a retrospective review of our NDD/FV donors in an effort to demonstrate the &#39;value&#39; of NDD both nationally and for our incompatible pairs.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective cohort review of LD transplants was completed from 1/2015 to 12/2020. Additional data on PKE transplants utilized NKR data. Clinical characteristics of NDD were assessed including those in the FV program after 2019 and NKR Advanced Donation Program (ADP) donors who donate in advance of their intended recipient. Also included were data on recipients from the deceased donor list allocated end-chain LD.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the study period, 45 NDDs (15 in 2015-2018, 30 in 2018-2020) presented. NDD demographics: 51% male (n=23), 97.8% Caucasian (n=44), mean age 45.2 years, mean BMI 25.3. NDD blood types: 48.9% O, 40% A. NDD plus 28 ADP donors enabled 162 transplants. This included 36 highly sensitized (PRA &gt; 80%) patients, including 15 with a PRA &gt; 98%, and 71 DD waitlist patients that received compatible LD kidneys. For the highly sensitized patients, average wait time for PRA &gt; 80% improved from 4.74 years to 3.33 months, and PRA &gt; 98% improved from 4.33 years to 6 months. In calendar years 2019 and 2020, NDD and FV donors represent 25-27% of the NKR donor population; since 2020 virtually all NKR NDD entered the FV program.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results demonstrate that a single center may realize a dramatic rise in volume with a concomitant decrease in wait time from full participation in national PKE. NDDs were diverse in age and gender, although almost universally Caucasian. Since the FV program benefits future generations while protecting donors, centers must inform potential AA donors of this option. The FV program offers donors a voucher in addition to other donor protections including travel and lost wage reimbursement and life insurance unavailable in comptible LD. Centers throughout the country must educate their patients to this option. Adding NDD to PKE has resulted in numerous highly sensitized patients throughout the US receive transplants while additonally benefitting candidates on the deceased donor waitlist.

Belatacept binds to CD80/CD86 on antigen-presenting cells, competitively blocking T cells from binding to APCs through CD28/CD152. While BK Viremia is a potential consequence of immunosuppression, limited data exists regarding the relationship between maintenance Belatacept therapy and BK Viremia in renal transplantation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Between 8/6/2011 and 6/4/2021, 143 kidney transplant patients at a single academic medical center were treated with a maintenance therapy regimen that included Belatacept in addition to low-dose Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil. Past histories of cardiovascular disease (atrial fibrillation, heart failure, pulmonary embolus, valve/coronary disease), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and obesity were obtained. BK Viremia was tested using real-time PCR with a positive value of over 100 copies/mL.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In this cohort of 143 participants, 93 were male and 50 were female. The average age was 50.13 years. 99 patients identified as white (69.2%), 31 as African American (21.7%), 5 as Latinx (3.5%), and 8 as Asian (5.6%). 56 (39.1%) individuals had a history of CVD, 141 (98.6%) had history of HTN, 92 (64.3%) had HLD, 44 (30.7%) had diabetes, and 63 (44.1%). were obese. 28 (19.6%) subjects experienced delayed graft function after transplantation, defined as the need for dialysis within one week of transplant. Of note, the patients who contracted BK viremia were found to be taking a significantly higher dose of Belatacept (436 mg vs. 401 mg, p=0.04). In this cohort, Asian patients treated with Belatacept were 6 times more likely to develop BK viremia (p=.01), and individuals with CVD were 3 times more likely to develop BK viremia (p=.04).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Preliminary data from this cohort demonstrate that higher doses of Belatacept are associated with greater incidence of BK Viremia. Analyses within this population also suggest that transplant patients of Asian descent and those with a history of CVD are at an increased risk of BK viremia when treated with a Belatacept-based immunosuppression regimen. Future research should be done to explore the course of BK Viremia and the potential implications on graft function in patients receiving Belatacept therapy compared to those receiving CNI maintenance therapy alone.

Lee<sup>1</sup>, A. Dua<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Vascular Surgery, Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Intermittent claudication (IC) is characterized by exertional pain without limb-threatening ischemia. While historical rates of limb loss for IC are low, patients are still offered intervention for symptomatic improvement. Femoropopliteal bypass surgery is reserved for treatment of IC that has failed maximal medical management. The long-term risks and consequences of femoropopliteal bypass surgery for IC remain unclear.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Research Patient Data Registry database was retrospectively queried for femoropopliteal bypass procedures using CPT codes. Electronic medical records were used to obtain demographic information, operative details, postoperative complications, and long-term outcomes. The study period was 25 years (1995-2020) with a median follow-up period of two years.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the study period, a total of 1421 patients underwent femoropopliteal bypass surgery, of which 282 (19.8%) were performed for IC. Median age of IC patients undergoing bypass was 68 (interquartile range [IQR] 61-73). The majority of IC patients were male (69.5%) and Caucasian (87.9%). Femoropopliteal bypass conduits included great saphenous vein (GSV) (n=136, 48.2%), prosthetic grafts (n=138, 48.9%), and non-GSV autogenous grafts (n=8, 2.8%). Distal bypass target was above-knee in 175 (62.1%) and below-knee in 107 (37.9%) patients. Concurrent procedures during bypass included femoral endarterectomy (n=100, 35.4%) and endovascular intervention (n=36, 12.8%). Median hospital length of stay was 4 days (IQR 3-5 days) after bypass. Postoperative complication rates were notable for wound infection (n=40, 14.2%), hematoma or pseudoaneurysm (n=6, 2.2%), graft infection (n=7, 2.5%), lymphocele/lymphorrhea (n=4, 1.1%), and myocardial infarction (n=3, 1.1%). Thirty-day readmission rate was 12.4% (n=35). Mortality rates were 0.4% (n=1) at 30-days and 3.2% (n=9) after one year. Primary patency rates were highest for patients undergoing AK bypass with GSV conduit (AK/GSV, 73.0%; AK/prosthetic, 66.3%; BK/GSV, 64.5%; BK/prosthetic, 51.2%) (p&lt;0.01).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Femoropopliteal bypass for intermittent claudication is associated with high rates of wound infection and thirty-day readmission. Patients undergoing bypass surgery should be educated on these risks, as well as rates graft patency and amputation-free survival prior to undergoing surgical intervention.

Racial/ethnic minorities and those from low socioeconomic backgrounds experience are at elevated risk of major amputation compared to their peers. The objective of this qualitative study was to determine patient-reported barriers to receiving care after developing a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted with fifteen predominantly low-income patients (Primary insurance: 53% Medicaid and 20% Indian Health Program) from a tertiary referral center. Telephone interviews were conducted in English or Spanish, recorded, and coded by research team members experienced in qualitative data gathering.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
All participants (5 Hispanics, 5 Native Americans, 5 Whites) had at least one DFU. Major themes which arose from the data relating to barriers to care included compounding health problems and life events, fragmented relationships with healthcare providers, the burden of follow up with multiple providers, expenses, elaborate care routines, and lack of healthcare information and understanding of disease process. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our interviews highlighted perceived barriers to medical care in a sample that is representative of the population served by our limb salvage team. The study revealed apparent shortcomings in assessing patients&rsquo; understanding of their illness and complications. As a result, there is an opportunity for improving communication and education, and therefore outcomes for our patients.

The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of the ESS for lower extremity endovascular procedures in non elective setting (neLEE).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The American College of Surgeons&rsquo; National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was retrospectively analyzed for patients undergoing neLEE between 2015 and 2019. The performance of the ESS in predicting mortality in each procedure was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analyses.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 4583 patients underwent neLEE with median age 68 (+ 12.3 SD), with 1802 females (39.3%). The 30-day mortality rate was 3.4%. The ESS correlated with 30-day mortality (area under the curve -AUC was 0.729). The predictive ability of the ESS decreased with increasing age, with the ESS performing best for patients between 60 and 69 years in age (AUC 0.735) and worst for patients above 80 years (AUC 0.650).

The score gradually and accurately predicted 30-day mortality; 0%, 1.6%, 4.8%, 31.3% and 100% of patients with ESS of 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 died within 30 days after surgery, respectively. ESS was also utilized to calculate risk of death/discharge to hospice (AUC 0.777), discharge to rehab (AUC 0.638), Renal failure (AUC 0.667), postintervention ventilation requirement (0.680), stroke (0.656) and UTI (0.676). A cumulative frequency table of mortality with ESS was used to partition patients into quartiles of ESS &lt; 4, ESS between 5 and 7, ESS between 8 and 9, and ESS &gt; 10. A Cochran- Armitage test showed linear trend towards increased 30-day mortality among the quartiles with increasing ESS (p&lt;0.001), with Quartile 4 (ESS&gt;10) having 15 times odds of increased 30-day mortality compared to reference quartile 1 (ESS&lt;4) (Table 1)

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: ESS performance accurately predicts mortality for neLEE procedures. Its use may be useful for preoperative risk stratification and has the potential to be utilized for national benchmarking after lower extremity endovascular procedures

It has been associated with uremic toxins, volume status, and hemodynamic changes after vascular access creation. There is scarce data regarding the long-term impact of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation on pulmonary hypertension, and the reflected changes on echocardiographic measurements. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective study was performed at the University of Miami Hospital/Jackson Memorial Health System from 2009 to 2014, evaluating patients who underwent an AVF creation for hemodialysis (HD). Patients who had a 2-D echocardiogram done before and after AVF creation were analyzed. Out of 93 patients, we included 64 that had the first echo maximum 1 year before the fistula creation, and a follow-up echo during the first 3 years post-fistula creation. The 2-D echo measurements analyzed were ejection fraction (%), right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP; mmHg), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The mean age at the time of AVF creation was 52 &plusmn; 12 years, 59% were men, with more prevalence in African Americans (55%). Hypertension was present in all patients included, and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery diasease were 67% and 22%, respectively. Only 27% of the patients analyzed had AVF creation before HD initiation, with no statistically significant differences in echocardiographic measurements compared to patients that had the previous HD. Nearly 75% of the patients had an elevated RVSP at baseline according to the cutoff set by the European Respiratory Task Force. Preoperative RVSP ranged from 13 to 93mmHg in the study population (45 &plusmn; 19.7). Overall, 64% of the subjects showed improvement in RVSP echocardiographic parameters after the fistula creation (p=0.002), with a significant reduction of 18.45mmHg in the group that showed improvement and 5mmHg (p=0.04) among the whole population.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results suggest that AVF creation reduced echocardiographic parameters that measure pulmonary pressures. The improvement was more pronounced in patients with elevated RVSP preoperatively.

Non-traumatic amputations due to vascular diseases have profound economic, social and psychological effects. Historically considered as diseases of the rich and aged, non-communicable diseases, including diabetes and vascular diseases, are now responsible for more than 77% of deaths and disability in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). A coordinated response to the epidemiologic transition will require mapping of available research. This review aims to identify the scope and accessibility of literature published on non-traumatic amputations due to vascular disease in LMICs.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We conducted a scoping literature search using PubMed, Medline, Embase, and CINAHL in November 2020 and reviewed original articles that assessed non-traumatic limb amputations due to vascular disease performed in LMICs including diabetic complications. Editorials, reviews and studies from High-Income Countries (gross national income per capita &gt;$12,535 annually) were excluded.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Out of 3407 initial studies, we included 272, 67.3% of which were published in open-access journals within the last decade (58.5%). Most articles were epidemiological (77.9%), with sample size ranging from 10 to 64,196 in multi-centre studies. The majority focused on diabetic complications (59.9%), and peripheral vascular disease (8.5%) describing both acute and chronic limb threatening ischemia. Other vascular pathologies associated with non-traumatic amputation included Buerger&rsquo;s disease, vascular pythiosis and HIV vasculitis. Amputation rates ranged from 1.4 - 71.4%. Less than one-third reported mortality data, and among these, mortality rates ranged from 0 -72%.

Most research was from South America (33.45%), and particularly from Brazil (20.6%). Figure 1. Within all regions, most amputations were accessed in the urban setting (79%), with limited data focused on amputation at primary care levels (3.03%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Available studies highlight a recent and significant burden of vascular related non-traumatic amputations in LMICs. However, significant research gaps exist as most data comes from South America. Paucity of clinical trials reporting long-term patient outcomes, quality of life studies, qualitative and economic assessments necessary for a holistic response was noted. To understand the depths of impact of limb amputation on a region, further research is required to fill in essential gaps.

Miller School Of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: When no superficial or deep vein is available in the distal upper arm to perform a direct fistula or a transposition, an arteriovenous graft (AVG) with outflow at the axillary vein, is an alternative option for patients requiring hemodialysis (HD). Our novel technique allows the use of a proximal brachial or basilic vein as an outflow, in a two-stage procedure. The first stage creates a midarm brachial artery to brachial vein AVF or uses the proximal vein from a non-mature basilic vein transposition, and the second stage involves ligation of the fistula and performing a graft extension with a straight or loop AVG using an end-to-end anastomosis to the large and thickened vein from the previously created fistula. This optimizes the venous anastomosis while preserving more proximal vessels that might be needed in the future.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective study was performed at the University of Miami Hospital/Jackson Memorial Health System from 2015 to 2021, evaluating patients who failed a basilic vein transposition or underwent creation of a mid-arm brachial artery to brachial vein AVF and subsequent AVG extension. A total of 104 patients underwent the procedure and were included. A survival analysis was done with time to loss of primary and secondary patency with Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression models adjusted for clinical and demographic covariates (age, gender, ethnicity, diabetes, antiplatelet agents, statins, AVF location, prior catheter use, and history of previous AVF). And a multivariate logistic regression was performed separately to evaluate the association of the covariates with the overall patency at 1 year of follow-up.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of 104 patients, 13 (12%) died during follow-up from unrelated causes. Around 75% of the subjects had previous AVF and all of them had a dialysis catheter at some point. The median follow-up time was 11 months (IQR= 11-30 months). The survival analysis showed 28% of patients lost their primary patency in a median time of 9 months, and 14% lost secondary patency in a median time of 60 months. However, the overall patency of the vascular access measured at 12 months with or without interventions was 85.6%. The most frequent intervention performed on the graft was balloon angioplasty, required in 11 patients (35%), followed by thrombectomy in 8 patients (25%), fistulogram in 5 patients (16%), banding in 4 patients (12%), and as a last resource, surgery and ligation in 3 patients (9%). Loss of primary patency (p=0.008), secondary patency (p=0.017) and patency during the first 12 months (p=0.036), were all significantly associated with increased age when adjusting for covariates.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results suggest that the technique of creating a graft extension using a large and thickened vein from a previous fistula can result in reliable and durable access. This is particularly important for patients with limited access for HD, as the axillary vein is preserved for future use if needed.

Literature identifying key factors affecting surgical management of these patients is scarce. Herein, we evaluated the outcomes of arterial injury to upper and lower extremities and identified factors associated with delayed amputation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective cohort study. Patients presenting with limb threatening arterial injury from 2009-2020 were identified through the Trauma registry of our rural Midwest academic Level 1 Trauma Center. Demographics, injury information, complications, and mortality were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with delayed amputation using SPSS 28.0. P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: One hundred sixty-one patients presented with limb threatening ischemia secondary to arterial injury during the study period, with a total of 29 (18%) who required delayed amputation. No significant difference was observed in terms of age, gender, injury severity score (ISS), or maximum abbreviated score (maxAIS) for extremities between patients who required amputation and those who did not. Those requiring amputation were more likely to have suffered blunt injury (72.4% vs. 48.5%, p &lt; 0.05) and to have developed all-cause infection during their index admission (27.6% vs. 10.7% p &lt; 0.05). Seventy-two patients required a bypass (45.3%); of those, nine patients (12.5%) required delayed amputation. The use of a synthetic or vein conduit for the bypass did not affect the incidence of amputation (7.1% vs. 14.3%; p = 0.665). Multivariate analysis controlling for age, gender, indicated that all cause infection (OR = 3.551 [1.221-10.324]; p = 0.020) and blunt mechanism of injury (OR = 3.413 [1.298-8.979]; p = 0.013) increased our patients&rsquo; risk for delayed amputation. In this model, not performing a bypass also increased our patients&rsquo; risk for delayed amputation (OR = 2.586 [1.037-6.450], p = 0.042).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results suggest that not performing a bypass, blunt mechanism of injury, and all cause infection are associated with delayed limb amputation following traumatic extremity injury. In this cohort, the incidence of a delayed amputation was not associated with the bypass conduit type. Further studies are warranted to identify additional factors associated with amputation following traumatic injury to optimize clinical care of patients presenting with traumatic limb ischemia.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a 2-year (2017-2018) retrospective analysis of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, including all patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing surgical intervention. Patients were stratified based on the type of procedure (CEA vs. CAS) and based on race/ethnicity. The primary outcomes were racial disparities and in-hospital patient outcomes. The complication is defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. Regression analysis was performed to assess outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 21,031 patients were included of which 92.7% underwent CEA.5% of patients were African American (AA) and 3.7% were Hispanics (HP). AA was more likely to undergo CEA (p=0.01) than CAS. 18.5% of patients were symptomatic CS. AA and HP were more likely to have complications (AA: p=0.042, HP: p=0.045) and readmission (AA: p=0.041, HP:p=0.038) within 30-d of the procedure compared to Caucasians. On regression analysis controlling for contributing factors (age, gender, comorbidities, race, procedure performed) AA (OR:1.15 [1.08-4.2], p=0.45) were independently associated with complications. On sub-analysis of symptomatic only patients, there was no difference in complications based on race.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:. Racial and ethnic disparities present among patients with CS and outcomes after the intervention.

Many residency programs are currently exploring how this change has affected the match results. The purpose of this study was to compare one of the largest general surgery residency program&rsquo;s application and match data from pre-COVID (2017-2020) to the 2021 cycle.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review was performed of all individuals who applied to our General Surgery Residency Program from the 2017 match cycle through the virtual application season in 2021. Specific application responses were recorded: medical school, medical school state, contact state, gender, and race/ethnicity. The primary outcome was the number of locally matched (home program and/or in state) applicants. The secondary outcomes were total number of applications, change in applicant demographics, and variability of the geographic spread. Chi-squared tests of independence, Fisher&rsquo;s exact tests, and negative binomial regression were performed.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 6,819 applicants from 2017-2021 included in the study. There was an increase in applications in 2021 compared to previous years but this was not statistically significant (p= 0.2759). The distribution of 2021 applications was different from previous years regarding gender (p&lt;0.0001) and race (p&lt;0.0001). The 2021 application cycle had a greater proportion of applicants from US (p&lt;0.0001) and southern US medical schools (p=0.0076). Though not statistically significant, absolute increases were seen in number of applicants from southern US medical schools, in-state medical schools, and the institution&rsquo;s own medical school. While the 2021 cycle had significantly more interviews (p= 0.0127), there were no significant differences in the composition of interview cohorts. All the matches for the program during the study period were students from US medical schools, with the majority coming from southern US medical schools (84.9%). During the 2021 application year, all 11 matches were from southern medical schools and there was a record number of matched female applicants (9), though this was not significantly different from previous years.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: During the COVID-19 virtual match cycle, an increase in both number of applications and number of interviews for General Surgery residency was identified. The characteristics of applicants that interviewed and subsequently matched at this institution were not different when compared to previous years, demonstrating that virtual interviews did not significantly change our program&rsquo;s match results. As virtual interviews may become more commonplace, this study has the potential to identify heavily weighted categories that influence rank lists of both applicants and programs. A future multi-institutional study including all general surgery residency programs in the state is underway to expand the power and generalizability of this study.

General Surgery Departments with surgical residencies (GSDs) have implemented Twitter for academic and community outreach, networking, and brand promotion. Literature quantifying GSD user engagement (UE) has been minimal. This study aimed to examine GSD Twitter use, quantify UE, and determine optimal Twitter use for GSDs .

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This cross-sectional study analyzed GSD Twitter accounts with Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education-accredited general surgery residencies. Accounts were identified via Twitter searches. Twitter-accessible programming interface was used to extract publicly available GSD account and Tweet metrics from March 2006 to July 1, 2021. Tweet metrics were assigned multipliers by engagement level per Tweet: Likes and Retweets [RTs]=x1, replies and video views =x2, quotes =x3. Multiplied metrics were added to quantify UE per Tweet. Each metric was divided by monthly Tweet frequency (MTF) to control for account age. Accounts and Tweets were also analyzed by region. Sentiment analysis (SA) was used to quantify author opinion. Statistical analyses included t-tests, ANOVA, and bivariate correlations, where appropriate. Linear regression was conducted to predict user engagement over time (significance p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 100 GSD Twitter accounts with a mean account age and number of tweets: 59.6 months and 1484, respectively. Mean account followers (1931) were higher than mean accounts followed (578). Two accounts had no posted Tweets. Tweets from the Northeast were on average 2.4 years older than other regions (p&lt;0.01); UE remained similar across regions (p=0.69). More recent Tweets were more likely to be RTs rather than GSD-created Tweets (p&lt;0.01). GSDs with more RTs were more likely to have better UE (r=0.49, p&lt;0.01). RTs had higher mean sentiment than original Tweets (0.18 vs 0.10, p&lt;0.01). GSD UE peaked in 2019, with a noticeable decline since. Thirty-one GSDs (31%) had a residency-associated Twitter account, and those had a higher MTF (32.4 vs 15.7, p=0.02). Among those, UE remained similar (p=0.34).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although Twitter is a popular platform for GSDs, UE for GSDs has plateaued. Given the increasing use of other social media platforms, GSDs should consider seeking alternative social media platform(s) to maximize audience outreach. As such, high-frequency tweeting may yield a lower return on investment as compared to the past.

This qualitative study aimed to determine how applicants to a general surgery residency define the concept of psychological safety.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This is a qualitative study performed at an academic tertiary care center during interviews for general surgery residents. Applicant interviews took place between November 2020 and January 2021, with 95 total in-person interviews. During each standard interview the applicant was asked to define what it is about a residency program that makes them feel psychologically safe. Applicant responses were recorded. Once research team members developed initial coding of the responses, final themes and subthemes were developed through iterative group consensus in the qualitative research process. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Following coding and analysis, the themes and subthemes that emerged in exploring the definition of psychological safety are represented in Figure 1.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The concept of psychological safety as defined by applicants to general surgery residency relates to a sense of connection, sense of respect, open communicationrespect, communication, connection, and diversity within the program. Within this construct, subthemes relating to teamwork, support of diversity and authenticity &ndash; including support from leadership, and safety of expression emerged. The significance of these data is found in creating a blueprint for program leadership to construct an environment conducive to optimal learning and well-being.

Parsons<sup>1</sup>, N. Narula<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Surgery, Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
In recent years, general surgery and general surgery training have undergone many changes, including duty hour restrictions, an increase in minimally invasive procedures, and more subspecialty fellowships and integrated residencies. Prior studies have looked at resident case loads and complexity over time. Our unique aim was to examine the change in operative experience over time stratified by post-graduate year (PGY). We describe the operative volume across trainee years at two corresponding time periods approximately a decade apart in a general surgery residency at a large tertiary academic center.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This single-center retrospective cohort study included cases with consistent trainee involvement from two three-month time periods: June 24th to September 23rd in 2009 and in 2018. Faculty, trainee PGY level, service (e.g. general surgery, thoracic surgery), and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) case type were collected. Cases with multiple trainees involved were noted, with case attributed to highest trainee level for the primary outcome. Cases without a trainee were excluded.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The volume of cases between the two gropus did not change, 1940 in 2009 compared to 1967 in 2018. However, there was a change in the distribution of cases across trainee levels (p&lt;0.001). The percentage of cases with a PGY-1 as the highest trainee remained the same (17.0% and 15.2%, p=0.11), but there was a decrease in cases for PGY-2 residents (9.6% to 6.5%, p&lt;0.001). For PGY-3 residents, the percentage increased from 13.9% in 2009 to 18.9% in 2018 (p&lt;0.001). The percentage of cases with senior residents (PGY-4 and PGY-5) was the same overall, but this was due to a mixed picture; there were more cases with a PGY-4 in 2018 (20.3%) than in 2009 (16.6%) (p=0.003), whereas for chief residents (PGY-5), the cases decreased from 2009 to 2018, 23.4% to 20.6% (p=0.037). The percentage of cases assisted on by a fellow remained similar, 19.5% to 18.6% (p=0.46). Interestingly, percentage of cases with more than one trainee doubled, from 6.2% to 13.8% (p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
General surgery training has changed and continues to evolve. This snapshot of case distribution over approximately a decade at an urban tertiary care center shows that there were changes to operative volume with interesting nuances depending on PGY year. The implications of these changes are unclear and deserve further study. Future studies can investigate reasons for these changes and target institution-specific PGY level discrepancies if needed.

Residents are the source of mistreatment 25% of the time. Despite this, there is a paucity of effective interventions. Forum theatre (FT) is a novel educational tool to engage participants in problem solving of difficult situations. FT starts with the performance of an uncomfortable scenario specific to the local environment and then invites the audience (spect-actors) to participate in replays of the situation until a collective solution is identified. We present the use of FT as a tool to explore solutions to address mistreatment in a surgery residency.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This study involved a large academic general surgery residency whose leadership was supportive of the initiative. The major interventions occurred during weekly scheduled didactic time. During Phase 1, residents participated in focus groups led by researchers to delineate issues they faced in residency. This led to the development of broad themes of mistreatment. During Phase 2, a group of residents were recruited to participate as actors in the FT. They reviewed themes noted in Phase 1 and settled on &ldquo;Peer to Peer mistreatment&rdquo; with a focus on public, corrective feedback. They created a scenario that was broadly applicable and rehearsed it over several meetings with coaching from the Principal Investigator (PI). During Phase 3, three resident actors implemented FT during a didactic hour, with the PI moderating. The first iteration of the acted scenario ended unsatisfactorily with an uncomfortable ending. The audience was then encouraged to engage with the actors to improve the outcome. With each iteration, changes were made. Ultimately, audience members replaced some of the actors and provided examples of how they would have handled the scenario. This led to a lively debate. After the activity, residents filled out a retrospective pre-post survey. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 32 of 63 residents (50%) in the program participated. The residency is diverse - 46% female, 43% people of color and 30% international medical graduates. In the post FT survey, residents noted an improved understanding of mistreatment, felt more confident in recognizing mistreatment, reported improved confidence in their ability to intervene when witnessing mistreatment and to recognize when they themselves were involved in mistreatment (p&lt;0.001 for all). In fact, of the residents who reported participating in mistreatment, 100% reported they directed it towards peers; this suggested the theme was appropriate for this program&rsquo;s context. After the FT, 88.9% of residents said they &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; or &ldquo;most likely&rdquo; recommended participating in a FT to address mistreatment. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Nationally, mistreatment occurs frequently in surgical residency. FT is a novel tool to engage residents to self-evaluate and participate in methods to address mistreatment. FT interventions can be tailored to the local culture to address conflicts specific to that setting.

Divino<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Mount Sinai Hospital, General Surgery, New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Tracking surgeon preferences has typically been implemented in preference cards that are meant to facilitate operating room staff rather than the education of residents. To these authors&rsquo; knowledge, no tools exist to easily catalog surgeon preferences for the purpose of gaining insight into how differences in attending preferences can benefit learning during residency and even beyond as a resource after graduation. This study aimed to investigate resident and attending attitudes towards tracking surgeon preferences. We hypothesized that residents would benefit from a resource for tracking surgeon preferences geared specifically towards operative learning.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Separate surveys composed of 5-point Likert scaled questions were sent to residents and attendings in the general surgery department at a single-institution. We developed a cloud-based, crowdsourced, and cross-platform resource with the free database app Airtable that residents can use to track surgeon preferences across ten different fields using drop-down selects or text-entry on their mobile phones or web browsers.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Surveys were completed by 21 general surgery residents (62%) and 19 attendings (51%). The majority of residents found remembering surgeon preferences to be stressful and would find a resource to tracking preferences useful, not only in familiarizing themselves with the procedures but also in informing their future practices. Attendings generally had varied expectations of residents, with most attendings expecting residents to remember their preferences after 5 times performing the same operation. Attendings report that residents who remembered their preferences tended to correlate to shorter operative times, better anticipation of next steps, and more knowledgable residents.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A resource to enable residents to track attending preferences can be utilized to improve resident familiarity with operative procedures, possibly decreasing operative time and resident stress. It is customized to include both key maneuvers and potential pitfalls of each procedure. Its utility can even extend beyond residency to inform graduates as they become independent surgeons. We propose the use of the Airtable app for tracking surgeon preferences as an educational tool for general surgery residency programs as well as other surgical specialties.

Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) are a developing concept in the medical education field gaining popularity as an approach to competency-based training. EPAs are designed to allow for assessment of and feedback on activities that occur frequently within the context of clinical care. For residents in surgical training programs, this includes not only operative care, but also pre-operative care. However, there has been little focus in the surgical education literature on assessments of pre-operative activities. The purpose of this study was threefold: 1) to understand discrepancies between data collected on intra-operative performance versus pre-operative performance, 2) to categorize the types of comments and self-reflection that happens during pre-operative assessment, 3) to gain insight from attendings and residents on pre-operative feedback.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Data were gathered through a mobile application developed by a department of surgery. All faculty and residents were given training prior to use. The app includes a 0-4 independence rating, from observation only to supervising others, with a free text box to allow critique and comments. Data on pre-operative and intra-operative performance on right lower quadrant pain, gallbladder, and inguinal hernia EPAs were analyzed. Two general surgery residents and two attending surgeons participated in semi-structured interviews. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Chi Square tests showed a significant difference between the proportion of pre-operative and intra-operative assessments (Table 1). Faculty comments and resident self-reflections primarily addressed clinical performance, ability to assess, and independence. Specific areas for improvement, case difficulty, communication, and timeliness were discussed much less frequently. During the interviews, residents discussed ways to make pre-operative feedback more useful for learning, while attendings discussed barriers to pre-operative feedback, the biggest of which was lack of opportunities to observe pre-operative activity.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Opportunities for pre-operative performance feedback and reflection were taken much less frequently than those for intra-operative feedback and reflection. When residents and faculty did reflect and comment on pre-operative performance, the primary areas addressed were overall clinical performance, ability to assess the patient, and level of independence. Residents felt there were ways that pre-operative assessment could be made more effective and attendings struggled with a lack of opportunities for observation. Identifying other members of the care team who could provide pre-operative performance feedback to residents could help to strengthen assessment in this phase of patient care.

More than one-third of general surgery residents report a lack of meaningful mentorship at their home institution. A novel national mentorship network was created by the AAS/SECOND Trial to help address this need. This study aims to examine the residents who sought external mentorship and their needs.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
General surgery residents whose programs were randomized to the SECOND Trial intervention arm (N=106 programs) were invited to enroll in the mentorship program. Enrollees completed an electronic Mentee Profile where they provided demographic information, ranked qualities they desired in a mentor, and indicated discussion topics of interest. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 90 residents enrolled in the mentorship program, of which 64.4% were female, 71.6% non-White or Hispanic, and 13.3% LGBTQ+; the underlying population of general surgery residents is 43% female, 38% non-white, and 5% LGBTQ+. Same gender, race/ethnicity, and LGBTQ+ identity were ranked within the 3 most important qualities for a mentor by 69.6% of women, 50% of racial/ethnic minorities, and 73% of LGBTQ+ participants. Residents expressed interest in discussing certain common topics such as career planning (97%), fellowship match (74%), and mental health (26%). The majority of both females (72%) and males (67%) wished to talk about work-life balance. Being an underrepresented minority in surgery was selected as a discussion topic by 75% of women, 65% of racial/ethnic minorities, and 83% LGBTQ+ residents. Verbal and emotional abuse and bullying was chosen as a discussion topic by 17% of participants, all whom belonged to at least one underrepresented minority group. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
A high proportion of residents seeking external mentorship belong to a group that is underrepresented in surgery. Many of these residents desire to be matched with a mentor of a similar background. They may have no such resource within their own institution or may desire anonymity when discussing sensitive topics. These results speak to the importance of representation in surgical faculty. Until the workforce is adequately diversified, the AAS/SECOND Trial National Mentorship Network may help offset the impact of being underrepresented in surgery.

Surgical residents often begin intern year without receiving formal training in obtaining informed consent. While various interventions have shown immediate improvements in intern skills and confidence, none have evaluated long-term effects of providing informed consent training early in intern year. Our objectives were 1) to develop a training workshop for interns at our institution, 2) evaluate the effect of training on long-term confidence and experience of the interns, and 3) characterize faculty confidence around intern obtained informed consent.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
General surgery interns at a single academic center underwent a training workshop on informed consent that involved didactics, standardized patient encounters, and supplemental procedure specific tools at the start of the academic year. The trained group and prior class of untrained interns were surveyed on confidence and experience discussing all aspects of informed consent at the end of the academic year. Attending physicians were surveyed on their confidence in the ability of the two cohorts to obtain consent. Surveys primarily employed a standard 5-point Likert scale (5=always; 1=never).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Twenty-four incoming interns participated in the training workshop. Of the fifteen that completed the pre-workshop survey, only one felt fully confident consenting for common surgical procedures. At the end of the academic year, all the trained cohort (100%) felt confident in their consenting ability compared to 73.3% of the previous class. Within the trained cohort, greatest improvement over the academic year was in confidence discussing procedural benefits (median score: 4 vs. 5; p=0.03; Table). Total confidence score improved from a median of 15 to 17.5 (highest possible 25; p=0.08). However, end of year total confidence (median: 15 vs. 17.5; highest possible 25; p=0.21) and total experience (median: 24 vs. 24.5; highest possible 35; p=0.72) were similar between trained and untrained interns. Faculty confidence scores were also similar between the cohorts (median total: 10 vs. 11; highest possible 20; p=0.87). Intern satisfaction was 80% with the didactic session, and 90% with standardized patient encounters, but only 20% used the supplemental materials.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Implementation of an intern targeted workshop incorporating didactics and standardized patient encounters at the start of the academic year was viewed as useful with long-term improvements in confidence. Development of strategies that target intern experience performing all aspects of consent and faculty confidence in intern ability to obtain informed consent are needed.

However, the transition to DRT can be stressful for trainees due to a perceived lack of programmatic structure and support. We sought to determine if a transitional curriculum could enhance resident perceptions of preparedness for DRT.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A once-weekly DRT transitional curriculum was implemented for surgery residents at an academic program during the Spring of 2021. Volunteer topic experts gave lectures on topics including mentorship, grantsmanship, and academic writing. Pre- and post-curriculum surveys were constructed and administered to assess residents&rsquo; perceptions of preparedness for DRT. Surveys included Likert scale (1 &ndash; Strongly Disagree to 5 &ndash; Strongly Agree) and open-ended questions. In a mixed-methods approach, ordinal data were presented as the median with interquartile range (IQR) and comparisons were made with the Mann U Whitney test (p &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant). Qualitative analysis of open-ended questions was performed via inductive coding by two authors independently who met to reach coding consensus.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We obtained 14 pre-curriculum survey responses from categorical general (9/14 69%), integrated vascular (1/14 8%), and non-designated general (3/14 23%) surgery residents. 39% of respondents already had an advanced research degree (e.g. MPH, PhD), and health services research was the most common focus among residents pursuing DRT (4/14; 31%). Following implementation of the curriculum, 7 residents responded to the post-curriculum survey. Responses indicated significantly improved confidence in several topic areas, including applying for grants (4 [2.5-4] vs. 1 [1-3]) and writing a biosketch (4 [3-4.5] vs. 2 [1-3]), among others (Figure 1). Residents felt that their participation in the curriculum was important for their research career (5 [3-5]). Residents&rsquo; cited goals for DRT included research skill acquisition, career exploration, and academic productivity. Anticipated challenges during DRT included prioritizing projects, managing time, and obtaining funding.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: DRT is a critical time for the development of trainees in academic surgery. Implementation of a weekly transitional curriculum to improve DRT preparedness significantly impacted residents&rsquo; confidence to successfully make the transition. Future work should assess the impact of the curriculum on measures of academic productivity (e.g. publications &amp; successful grant applications). Other programs may benefit from implementing similar curricula that are tailored to the individual needs of their residents and institutional resources.

Colorectal surgery is an evolving field shaped by constant development of new tools and surgical approaches. Fellowship directors have a unique role in shaping the training of their fellows. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between colorectal surgery fellowship program directors and industry. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A list of current colorectal surgery fellowship programs in the United States was obtained from the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). Program directors were identified, and general demographic data were collected on their respective fellowship program website pages. H-indexes were collected from the SCOPUS database. All data about industry payments including total payments, nature of payments, and sources of payments were collected from the Open Payment database, which had data for 2014-2020. Industry payments were analyzed by year, and nature of payments. Significance was set at p=0.05. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In total, 65 program directors were included. Of those, 15 (23.1%) were women. The mean h-index among female PDs was 14.87 and 10.9 among male PDs (p=.23). Female PDs had a mean total payment of USD 10,271.78 while male PDs had a mean total payment of USD 25,580.36. (p=.28) In 2018, the sum of payments reached an all-time high of USD 259,656.81. Food and beverage (n=62), travel and lodging (n=55), and education (n=44) were the three most common natures of payments.

However, this traditional coaching strategy may not benefit or suit all surgeons who require a different teaching style. Alternatively, formative feedback allows participants to deliberately practice surgical activities, give and receive high-quality feedback in a small group, and develop new and ongoing mental models of expert performance. We describe a qualitative analysis from year 2 of a 3-year video-based formative feedback program that aims to provide expert environments for surgeons.

<strong>Methods: </strong>Data for this study are from year 2 of a 3-year study focused on technical improvement in colorectal surgery. 15 colorectal and general surgeons took part in four video-based formative feedback sessions. Participating surgeons recorded challenging colorectal cases laparoscopically or using GoPros and brought the video to group discussion. Participants engaged in open discussion about their case with other surgeons and were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Surgeons participated in four formative feedback sessions and interviews were conducted after first, second, and fourth sessions. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed and reported thematically.

<strong>Results: </strong>Participants in our study described three unique aspects of expert formative feedback (Table). First, formative feedback decenters a traditional one-on-one coaching style to team-based learning. In our model of formative feedback, learning is decentered as the hierarchical relationship between coach/coachee is dismantled and transformed to a space of equality. Second, formative feedback allowed participants to overcome traditional surgeon identity by encouraging skills-related vulnerability. In some cases, having an accomplished &ldquo;rock star&rdquo; surgeon in the group and their demonstration of public vulnerability eased less experienced surgeons. Finally, participants described that formative feedback created a safe cultural space, to engage in ways surgeons were often unsafe to.

<strong>Conclusion: </strong>Surgical coaching is one pathway to continuous improvement and has gained popularity over the course of the last decade. Many coaching programs match coaches to coachee based on outcomes, experience, and willingness&mdash;these programs have proved to be valuable to continuous technical and professional development. However, one size technical improvement does not fit all. Formative feedback, with the goal of acknowledging expert learning and treating all participants as equals, creates intentional spaces for surgeons from a variety of practices to engage in open discussion and feedback.","Education","Continuing Medical Education","Colorectal"

This study aimed to understand the current landscape and characterize global medical student knowledge, resources, and barriers pertaining to research compared to clinical experience. 

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A diverse focus group created and conducted a cross-sectional survey to ascertain medical student perceptions of clinical and research experience among medical students internationally. An IRB was approved by the University of Minnesota. The survey was distributed to medical students online through social media networks via international partnerships from Nov 1st - Dec 31st 2020. Statistical analysis included logistical regression analysis comparing respondents across three international regions, with adjustment for years of medical school experience. 

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Medical students (n=318) from more than 26 countries responded to the survey, with four-fifths (87.1%) of respondents reporting interest in conducting research in medical school. Participants identified training priorities in providing additional research opportunities (69%), lack of mentors (57%), lack of formal training (56%), and barriers due to the COVID-19 pandemic (50%). Regionally, students from Sub-saharan Africa (SSA) and Latin America (LA) were much more likely to be interested in conducting research later in their medical training at 89% and 71% vs than North America (NA) at 58%, and expressed interest in becoming physician scientists (83% and 61% vs 31%), shown in Figure 1. Students from SSA 6.4x (2.5, 15.8) and LA (1.6x, 0.70, 3.85) were more likely to report lack of access to research resources as a factor to preventing research, in addition to lack of financial resources, lack of access to medical research articles, and lack of ability to attend conferences, compared to those from NA. More than 93% of students reported willingness to participate in research as medical students with such barriers removed.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite significant interest in research, medical students globally report lack of formal research training, opportunities, and several barriers to conducting research, including the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey demonstrates a need for student research training internationally, with additional resources tailored to students from specific regions to overcome obstacles reported.

Herein, we aimed to determine the impact of using 3D models on patients&rsquo; experience and surgeons&rsquo; understanding of preoperative anatomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Prospective single center study. Patients undergoing liver resection were included and classified based on Lee et al complexity score. Preoperative cross-sectional imaging was used for 3D digital and printed models were created for each patient. A 5-point Likert scale survey was administered to patients and surgeons to assess understanding of the patient anatomy and perceptions of patient involvement in care. The survey was answered at two time points: before and after 3D liver model completion.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 35 patients were included, 14 (40%) were female and median age was 51 (IQR 32-63) years old. Living liver donors and primary liver cancer were the most common reasons for surgery (34.3% each). The most common procedures were right hepatectomy (42.9%) and right trisectionectomy (25.7%).

In the medium-complexity group, 18 (64%) patients, and 21 (75%) patients selected &ldquo;strongly agree&rdquo; in response to understanding and feeling involved with their decision before 3D education and increased to 24 (86%, p=0.004) and 25 (89%, p=0.1) after 3D education, respectively. In the low- and high-complexity group, 100% of patients selected &ldquo;strongly agree&rdquo; in both questions before and after 3D education. Surgeons &ldquo;understood&rdquo; patients&rsquo; liver anatomy on 2, 14, and 1 cases before 3D education and increased to &ldquo;completely understood&rdquo; in 0 (p=1), 18 (p&lt;0.001), and 2 (p=0.2) cases after 3D education in the low-, medium- and high-complexity group, respectively (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patient specific 3D anatomic models allowed personalized care for our patients, enhanced satisfaction, engagement and better understanding of their surgical procedure in those undergoing medium-complexity surgery. In addition, there was improved clinical planning for the surgeon.

Medical trainees who participate in global rotations demonstrate improved cultural-sensitivity, increased involvement in humanitarian efforts, and creative care with limited resources. These skills lead to increased grit, which positively correlates with well-being, perseverance, and job satisfaction. Unfortunately, the global coronavirus pandemic halted global rotations for medical trainees for 2020-2021. As trainees explore options to develop these skills, domestic rural practice in rural surgery may offer a unique alternative. Rural and global surgery share many characteristics including diversity of practice and commitment to underserved communities. We aimed to understand medical students&#39; perceptions of the similarities and differences between global and rural surgery and how their priorities impact their career choices.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
An electronic survey was administered to all medical students in eleven medical training institutions in Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan. Survey collection took place spring 2021. Mixed methods analysis of students who stated interest in global surgery was performed. Descriptive analysis of quantitative data was completed using SAS 9.4. Two authors organized the qualitative data into major, sub, minor and micro-themes. A third author resolved any disputes. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of the 697 medical student respondents, 202 were interested in global surgery. Of those, only 18.3% were interested in rural health. These students were more likely to choose a rural setting in global surgery (p&lt;0.0001) and less likely to prioritize careers that involved teaching/research (OR=0.25, p=0.002). Nearly half of the students interested in global surgery (46.6%) were unsure of their interest in rural health but were more likely to choose rural global surgery (p&lt;0.0001). When choosing careers, these students were more likely to prioritize work-life balance (OR=2.78, p=0.016), location of practice (OR=2.75, p=0.013), and proximity to family (OR=2.27, p=0.013) than those with interest in rural health. Those without rural health interest (35.1%) prioritized well-equipped facilities (OR=9.98, p&lt;0.001), location (OR=4.31, p=0.002), reimbursement (OR=2.81, p=0.0019), and prestige (OR=2.84, p=0.016). When asked to compare rural and global surgery, students focused on similarities in resource limitations but stated these limitations were more severe in the global setting.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Students interested in global surgery want to work with the challenges of practicing in low-resource setting. Many students with an interest in rural health and those unsure about their interest demonstrated a specific interest in rural global surgery. Those unsure of their interest in rural health prioritized factors found in rural health settings. These students may benefit from increased exposure to domestic rural surgery to understand the overlap with challenges of limited resources and their priorities of work-life balance and practice location in rural settings.

Yet, specifics on who is doing what and where is lacking, even at the institution level where many continue to function in silos. We aimed to explore surgical trainee and faculty involvement in global surgery and health-equity activities at an academic institution to strengthen the department&rsquo;s capacity to provide support. 

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Two similar surveys containing multiple choice and short answer questions estimated to take less than 10 minutes to answer were developed and piloted. A survey link was distributed, once to faculty and twice to trainees, in October 2020. Descriptive data analysis was conducted in Excel.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 153 faculty and 55 trainees contacted, 16 (10%) faculty and 14 (25%) trainees responded to the survey. Of the trainees who reported participating in global surgery work (N=8, 57%) there was equal involvement in international and domestic activities and only international activities (N=4, 50% for each). Faculty involved in global surgery work (N=10, 62%) mainly participated domestically (N=6, 60%). Trainee experiences involved international educational outreach, long-term academic partnerships, and research, while faculty mostly engaged in short-term clinical surgical activities and research domestically. Personal financing was the primary source of funding for most international activities. All trainees (N=14, 100%) and many faculty (N=13, 81%) were interested in additional engagement in international activities, with the most popular areas being educational outreach and training (N=18, 69%), international long-term academic partnerships (N=17, 65%). Nearly all trainees (N=13,93%) and most faculty (N=14,88%) were also interested in domestic activities, domestic research (N=17, 63%) being the most popular. Most faculty (N=14, 87%) and trainees (N=13, 93%) were interested in the relationship between social determinants of health and clinical outcomes yet reported a lack of experience measuring or applying interventions. Most faculty (N=12, 75%) want to involve trainees in a clinical, surgical, quality improvement, and/or research capacity on their projects. Perceived barriers to pursuing global surgery included lack of protected time, funding, institutional prioritization, and knowledge on how to engage.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Interest in global surgical and health equity work is high amongst surveyed trainees and faculty but barriers such as lack of protected time, funding, and knowledge on how to engage remain. Academic institutions are well-positioned to support this work by investing in and prioritizing it equally to traditional academic pathways. Survey findings will inform targeted interventions aimed to better support faculty and trainees in global surgery and health equity-related activities.

General surgery residents have had increasing opportunities to incorporate global surgery experiences and research into their training years. However, few resources are available for residency applicants to evaluate global surgery opportunities at programs to which they are applying.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A 17-question survey of all general surgery residency program directors (PD) was conducted by the Global Surgery Student Alliance through emails to the Association for Program Directors in Surgery listserv over the course of three consecutive weeks. PDs were able to indicate if they wish to remain anonymous or include de-identified information for an upcoming online database of global surgery activities.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 258 general surgery PDs were emailed the survey and 45 responses were recorded. 28 programs (62%) offered formal global surgery experiences for resident trainees, including clinical rotations (mostly short-term trips), research, and advocacy opportunities. 31 (68.8%) programs were in the process of developing a dedicated global health center at their institution. 93% of responders indicated that global surgery education was an important aspect of surgical training. Multiple barriers to global surgery participation were identified including lack of funding, difficulty in taking time away from other required rotations, low faculty participation, and minimal institutional interest.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While the great majority of PDs responded that global surgery was important, less than two thirds of responders&#39; programs offered formal experiences. Despite the significant increase in public awareness and participation in global surgery, these numbers have not significantly increased from prior surveys of general surgery programs. While this study is limited by a 17% response rate, it demonstrates that more advocacy and support is required to bolster training, research, and advocacy opportunities for surgical trainees and help incorporate a global perspective on healthcare.

Surgical residents are evaluated biannually in three general open-ended categories: 1) Compassion/Character 2) Work Habits 3) Surgical Skills, Judgment, and Knowledge Base. Each category contains multiple 5-point Likert scale evaluations. This study aimed to evaluate faculty and resident perceptions of the resident evaluation and feedback system in order to guide the implementation of a new standardized system.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All surgical residents and faculty members of PAACS were invited to assess the evaluation and feedback system using a 5-point Likert scale (1=strongly agree to 5=strongly disagree) in an anonymous 10-question survey hosted on Qualtrics. Surveys assessed if feedback was specific, fair, meaningful, and plentiful, and if evaluations were understood, fair, productive, relevant to trainees, and easy to use. Surveys also included 3 narrative feedback opportunities asking for strengths, weaknesses, and desired changes to the current system.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Survey response rates were 87% for faculty (72/83) and 32% for residents (34/107). Mean scores were calculated for each survey question for faculty and for residents. Most questions reflected favorable scores (strongly agree/agree) with the exception of opportunities for feedback, understanding skills areas/benchmarks, evaluation system fairness/objectivity, and clarity on how to evaluate residents with means &gt; 2 (neutral/disagree), as represented by the shaded areas in Figure 1. Most questions reflected concordance among faculty and residents with the exception of faculty having significantly less favorable perceptions on meaningfulness and value of feedback (p=0.037) and system fairness/objectivity (p=0.007). (* in figure 1 denotes p-value&lt;0.05). Important themes in the open-ended responses for strengths included &ldquo;holistic process&rdquo; and &ldquo;structured,&rdquo; and for weaknesses &ldquo;lack of objectivity&rdquo; and &ldquo;lack of detail.&rdquo;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although perceptions were generally positive, targeted areas for improvement were identified in feedback opportunities, delineation of skills areas/benchmarks, system objectivity, and grading clarity. This feedback is being used to inform a new system which aims to address these concerns. Additionally, these considerations can be taken as general user concerns in conventional resident evaluation and feedback systems.

Globally, more than two billion people lack access to surgery. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) Operation Giving Back (OGB) Global Health Competencies for Surgeons: Cognitive and System Skills Course was created in 2016 to provide a foundation of principles for surgeons interested in pursuing global surgery work. The aim of this study was to survey former course participants regarding subsequent global experiences, the application of course content, and feedback on covered subjects in order to better inform future course offerings.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A nineteen-question survey of multiple choice and short answer questions with branching logic was collaboratively developed. A link to the voluntary, anonymous Qualtrics survey was sent three times (May 2020, July 2020, March 2021) to participants via provided contact information. Survey responses were downloaded to Excel for further analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of N=179 course participants from four annual course offerings, N=175 were reached with N=34 (19%) responding to the survey. Roughly half of respondents (N=16, 47%) were trainees at the time of the course and most (N=27, 79%) specialized in general surgery. Eighty-two percent (N=28) had participated in global surgery work since the course, most commonly via short-term clinical missions, research, and/or educational outreach, and most often in Africa (N=20, 59%). For those who did not engage in global surgery projects after the course (N=6, 18%), the most important barriers included lack of funding or institutional support, as well as safety concerns. Confidence in course subjects, on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (most confident), was highest for the role of surgery in global health (4.2) and ethical challenges (4.1) and lowest for obtaining funding (2.9) and conducting research (2.8). Nineteen (56%) respondents networked with course faculty since attending, making this the most utilized resource. Participants considered ethical challenges, unmet needs in global surgery, and effective partnerships as the most useful topics to continue in future courses.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Survey results reveal participants have applied course resources to a variety of contexts and have high confidence in historically challenging content areas. Respondents endorsed continuing inclusion of ethics, unmet needs, and partnerships, with a greater focus on funding and research to boost confidence in these subjects. Survey results will allow content to be tailored to student and discipline needs, providing aspiring global surgeons with a strong foundation on which to build their work. We hope this course increases the number and quality of surgeons who pursue global surgery, with the downstream effect of improving capacity and decreasing burden.

Humanitarian surgery is essential to medical care in conflict zones. The acuity of injuries and the manner patients present varies significantly from those seen in civilian settings. Due to constraints present in conflict zones, managing these patients requires special training as civilian surgeons do not routinely have adequate skills for surgery in conflict zones. Little is described in the literature about specific modes of training for humanitarian surgeons. This scoping review aims to summarize the existing literature and identify what improvements can be made in training civilian humanitarian surgeons.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A review of articles covering established courses for civilian surgeons interested in humanitarian surgery as well as those describing training of civilian surgeons in conflict zones was performed. 4000 abstracts were screened by two independent reviewers and 255 abstracts were selected for full text review. All conflicts were mediated by a third reviewer. Articles describing pre-hospital care and military experience were excluded from the full text review.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 5 relevant full texts, there were no formal recommendations and few courses have been established for civilian humanitarian surgeons. Cadaver-based teaching and augmented reality were the most common course themes. A cadaver-based course from the University of Colorado enhanced the skills of general surgery residents in powerless external fixation, with improvements in time to completion, stability and alignment of fractures. Another study comparing operative logs of Australian general surgery trainees to surgeons on humanitarian missions highlighted a discrepancy in exposure of civilian trainees to obstetric and orthopedic procedures. The System for Tele-mentoring with Augmented Reality (STAR) used tablet based video capture to allow remote surgeons to provide feedback intra-operatively using annotations placed on the screen, with fewer shifts in attention compared to conventional systems. The Colorado Humanitarian Surgical Skills Workshop provides focused teaching using didactic sessions and cadaver-based practice opportunities. This led to subjective and objective improvements in knowledge and skill. Global surgery electives in residency training are another avenue whereby civilian surgeons are exposed to humanitarian surgery though, for safety reasons, these rarely occur in conflict zones. Participation was thought to be limited due to lacking logistic and family support but the participants believed there was a positive impact on learning.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Given the austere environments humanitarian surgery is practiced within, civilian surgeons must be adequately trained, as to first do no harm. Current programs show cadaver-based courses and augmented reality are effective in transferring requisite knowledge but more standardized courses with appropriate metrics for evaluation are needed.

Chu<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Poor verbal communication during health encounters perpetuates health inequity, mistrust, dissatisfaction, and worse health outcomes. Surgeons are at-risk for having poor verbal communication skills and though opportunities exist to improve them through coaching and simulation, both can be resource and time intensive. This project aims to understand the feasibility of using app-based virtual coaching as an alternative method to help surgeons improve verbal communication with patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The publicly available virtual coaching app &ldquo;Speeko&rdquo; was the primary coaching modality. Patient-surgeon simulations were based on two scenarios: newly diagnosed appendicitis (case A) and anorectal abscess (case B). Surgeons were simulated by medical students and surgical residents. Each simulation was conducted in two phases: in Phase 1, case A or B was given to gain baseline metrics on verbal communication. The simulated patient also completed the Communication Assessment Test (CAT), a 14-item validated instrument used by patients to assess doctors&rsquo; communication, after each phase. In Phase 2, surgeons viewed the Speeko and CAT data from Phase 1, then the alternate scenario was conducted. Scenarios were recorded and transcribed by Speeko. Results from Phases 1 and 2 were compared using paired t-tests. Primary outcomes from Speeko were speech characteristics that included pace, repeated words rate, clarifying words rate, non-inclusive words rate, medical jargon words rate, filler words rate, and amount of time the doctor spent speaking. The secondary outcome was the CAT.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Six participants (2 medical students, 4 surgical residents) were recruited. Each participated in 2 scenarios, for a total of 12 simulations. On Speeko analysis of Phase 1, average pace was 159 words per minute, repeated words rate was 2%, clarifying words rate was 5%, non-inclusive words rate was 0%, medical jargon words rate was 10%, filler words rate was 6%, and amount of time doctor spent speaking was 6.46 minutes. After Phase 2, no significant differences were observed in Speeko metrics. In terms of patient feedback, after Phase 1, mean total score for the CAT was 56.83 (&plusmn; 3.67) out of 70 and mean question score was 3.87 (&plusmn; 0.15) out of 5. After Phase 2, statistically significant improvements (p &lt; 0.05) were observed in mean total score was (64.92 vs. 56.83) and mean question score (4.48 vs. 3.87), as well as items such as &ldquo;[my doctor] understood my main health concerns, paid attention, listened carefully, showed care and concern, and spent the right amount of time with me.&rdquo;

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Use of a virtual speech coaching app was feasible in providing feedback on surgeons&rsquo; verbal communication skills, and significant improvements were observed in communication. While promising, future work is needed to establish virtual speech coaching apps as an innovative and effective way to improve surgeons&rsquo; verbal communication.

Ozgediz<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Francisco, Surgery Department, San Francisco, CA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of California - San Francisco, Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States are underrepresented in the practice of medicine and surgery, contributing to healthcare disparities. Surgical career exposure programs are effective at tracking students from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine (URiM) into the field. However, no existing program curriculum allows students to explore the relationships between local and international surgery, the disparities that exist across contexts, or how they could join the field to effect change.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A cohort of 20 URiM San Francisco Bay Area high school students, age 16 -18 years, enrolled in the High School Summer Global Surgery Program. Delivered online, the 5-day curriculum included lectures from both international and domestic surgeons and anesthesiologists, and hands-on activities. Additionally, a mixed-professions panel of practitioners who care for surgical patients, including a nurse practitioner, registered dietician, physical therapist, and an operating room technician, was included. All faculty lecturers were from minority backgrounds. Pre- and post-program surveys were administered to program participants to assess impact in student interest in surgical or global health careers and in confidence in their ability to join the healthcare field. Descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon Signed Rank testing were utilized to assess survey data.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We found a statistically significant increase in self-reported knowledge of global health and health equity after participation in the program (p=0.01). On a Likert scale ranging from 1-Not Enjoyable to 5-Extremely Enjoyable, every lecture and lab component had a mean score &gt;4, indicating uniform enjoyment. Curricular content was best retained from the pediatric surgery day, which included discussions of fetal surgery and a live didactic anatomy lab session (90% of questions correct). The pediatric surgery day was also the highest rated session overall. Content taught through hands-on activities was better retained (92% correct) than either the domestic (76% correct) or international (74% correct) lecture content. We found student experience to be minimally impacted by the online delivery of the curriculum.
 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our study suggests that an online global surgery, anesthesia, and health equity course can improve URiM student confidence in their ability to join the healthcare field. Furthermore, hands-on activities are effective at both engaging students in medical content and promoting knowledge retention. Future programs can employ similar strategies of offering faculty engagement opportunities and interactive, hands-on activities to inspire minority students to pursure surgical and global health careers.

Programs seeking to engage and inspire high school students from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine to join the field are few and student perceptions of them have been minimally investigated.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The High School Global Surgery Program enrolled a cohort of 20 San Francisco Bay Area high school students from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds. Using the Kern 6 Step Approach, the curriculum was designed for delivery online over five days and included lectures from both international and domestic surgeons and anesthesiologists, hands-on activities, and interactive didactics. All lecturing faculty were also from minority backgrounds. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with half of the student cohort (n=10) to investigate student perceptions about the facilitators and barriers to their success in the healthcare field. Furthermore, the interviews sought to understand how the program curriculum impacted these perceptions. Eight interviews were conducted in pairs while two additional participants were interviewed alone to ensure thematic saturation. Framework Analysis, a type of thematic analysis, was used to analyze the data through transcription, coding, development of an analytic framework, and analysis of data for emergent themes.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified a desire to serve family and community as a primary motivator for the pursuit of a healthcare career for minority students. Additionally, supportive educational environments facilitated an interest in the field. We identified lack of racial and ethnic representation among physicians, concern about affording higher education, and navigating the physician career path as barriers. Finally, exposure to minority practitioners and issues of global health equity, and practicing the skills required of perioperative care professionals inspired this cohort of minority high school students to enter the healthcare field.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our study characterized the barriers and facilitators experienced by minority high school students on their journey to a healthcare career. We found that a 5-day surgical and global health career exposure program enhanced interest in pursuing a healthcare career. Facilitating minority student access to perioperative care specialists with whom they identify and providing opportunities to practice the necessary career skills are both strategies that should be employed in future programs that aim to support the pipeline of racial and ethnic minorities into surgical careers.

Miner<sup>1</sup>, A. Rizzo<sup>1</sup>, L. Sampson<sup>1</sup>, B. Cagir<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Guthrie Robert Packer Hospital, Sayre, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

In the United States there is an anticipated critical shortage of vascular surgeons in the coming decades. The shortage is expected to be particularly pronounced in rural areas. Our institution serves a very rural and underserved population, in which the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease continues to rise. Our institution maintains a general surgery residency and has all the required Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) rotations and educational infrastructure to support a vascular surgery fellowship. Our study aims to analyze the vascular caseload at our institution to determine if we and other institutions with similar surgical volumes can support the creation of a two-year vascular fellowship.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A single site retrospective review of the number and type of vascular cases conducted at our institution between July 2015 to July 2020 was performed. The procedures were grouped into the following ACGME defined categories: abdominal, cerebrovascular, complex, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), endovascular diagnostic/therapeutic, and peripheral. Abdominal included all open aortic surgeries. Cerebrovascular included carotid endarterectomy. Complex included transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) and any redo bypass operation. Peripheral included any open procedure involving the vasculature of the axilla or legs. The total number and annual average for each category was obtained. Using the annual average, a two-year estimate was calculated and compared to the ACGME minimum for each category.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

In the specified period, 6100 total surgical procedures were performed by 3 vascular surgeons at our institution. 2578 of the 6100 procedures met at least one of the ACGME defined category requirements. The number of cases performed in each category is summarized in Table 1. Our center greatly exceeded the requirements for each category except for abdominal. This is consistent with trends observed in most centers across the nation, which are seeing a decline in open repairs across all categories, especially in open abdominal repairs.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Despite our center&rsquo;s large vascular caseload and need for more vascular providers, there were not enough open abdominal cases performed to support the training of a vascular fellow. Given the continued decline in open aortic volume across the country, we anticipate that rural centers similar to our own will have difficulty establishing programs to train and recruit vascular surgeons. Flexibility in the abdominal category requirement or creation of open aortic fellowships may be necessary for smaller rural centers to train vascular surgeons.

Boeck<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Francisco, Department Of Surgery, San Francisco, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Medical schools in the United States (US) continue to respond to student interest in global health (GH) and the evolution of the field through strengthening related curricula, including a focus on ethics, bilateral and equitable partnerships, and exposure to varied specialties. The COVID-19 pandemic limited travel and, in concert with superimposed racial justice movements, exposed chasms in the US healthcare system that were impossible to ignore. We aimed to assess medical student GH knowledge and experience prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic and US racial justice movements to inform future offerings that best meet student interests and needs.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A novel, mixed methods 30-question survey was created in Qualtrics and disseminated two times between May and August 2021 through email and social media to all current students. Data underwent descriptive and thematic analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Twenty students who self-identified as interested in GH responded to the survey. Most (N=13, 65%) were in preclinical training with the remainder on clinical rotations or research. Respondents included 10 women (50%), with most self-identifying as Asian, Caucasian or bi/multi-racial. Over half (N=11) defined GH as noncontingent on geography. Five (25%) selected a definition with paternalistic undertones. Twelve (60%) said the pandemic and anti-racist movements had affected their GH definitions to include themes of equity and racial justice. Most (N=18, 90%) became interested in GH before medical school, commonly through volunteer (N=8, 40%) or family/personal experiences (N=4 , 20%). The majority (N=12, 60%) plan to incorporate GH into their careers. Respondents most frequently learned about GH through faculty (N=15, 75%) and student-led (N=10, 50%) activities, and research (N=11, 55%). Collectively, students identified 30 discrete research experiences during medical school, with 23% (N=7) conducted internationally. At the onset of COVID-19, 36% (N=9) of 25 ongoing projects were impacted by the pandemic due to challenges like an inability to travel (44%, N=11), change in research question (33%, N=3), or community partner planning barriers (11%, N=1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our survey showed most respondents entered medical school with an interest in GH. Yet nearly all endorsed a changed perspective since enrollment, with a paradigm shift towards equity and racial justice.This was potentially accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and racial justice movements, which challenged conventional GH work and uncovered disparities at home and abroad. These results highlight the importance of faculty and curricula that effectively address global needs and the critical impact this can have on medical students.

Medical students in the US continue to demonstrate a growing interest in global surgery work. It is unclear, however, what factors contribute to student interest in global surgery, and what goals students have in the field. This study aimed to identify general perceptions of, and motivators, behind global surgery participation among US medical students.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A Qualtrics-based survey was distributed to US medical students of all years enrolled at accredited allopathic or osteopathic medical schools via the Global Surgery Students Alliance (GSSA) national medical school network. Students were asked about their interest in, and perception of, global surgery work. Students expressing interest in global surgery were additionally asked to rank various possible motivators for their involvement.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There were 812 student responses from 42 medical schools across the United States. Among respondents, 85.1% expressed interest in global surgery work, 75.3% felt that global surgery should be included in medical school curriculums, and 82.7% felt that involvement in global surgery would make them a better future physician. However, only 4.0% had received education regarding global surgery as a part of their medical school curriculum, only 26.2% had mentors in the field, and only 36.0% thought that global surgery work was valued by healthcare institutions. Among those interested in global surgery, the most common motivators were &ldquo;a responsibility to help those who are less privileged or underserved&rdquo; (average rank of 3.2 out of 11), &ldquo;find global health to be academically interesting/engaging&rdquo; (3.6), and &ldquo;enjoy making relationships with people from different countries&rdquo; (4.4). Very few students were motivated by plans of permanently practicing abroad (9.9) or personal career advancement (8.4). Despite only 40.2% agreeing that current global surgery practices are ethical, most students still planned on participating in short-term missions (53.0%). Notably, the vast majority of students felt that disparities in the United States were just as important to address as those internationally (89.3%), and 86.2% had plans to work with underprivileged communities in the United States.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

 

Medical students in the United States demonstrated high levels of interest in global surgery work, largely fueled by a desire to help underserved individuals both locally and abroad. The high proportion of students interested in short-term international work, and the low proportion of students with formal training or mentors in global surgery, signals a need for greater education related to equitable global surgery practices.

Childbearing during surgical residency is receiving increasing attention with the American Board of Surgery recently modifying their family leave policy. However, the longitudinal experience of parenthood in residency is under characterized.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Site visits to 15 general surgery residency programs were conducted for the SECOND Trial; 366 semi-structured interviews and 27 focus groups were recorded and transcribed. Lexical searches identified content regarding parenthood. A codebook was developed using deductive and inductive logic, blending a theoretical model and emergent codes identified by the research team. Independent coding was performed by dyads using the constant comparative approach and reconciled by consensus. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
82 interviews had content around parenthood in residency: 41 trainees (40 residents, 1 fellow), 11 program directors, 24 surgical faculty, 2 Designated Institutional Officials of Graduate Medical Education, and 4 administrative staff. Emergent codes were classified as either Challenges or Program Supports and grouped within 3 phases of parenthood (Table). During Pregnancy, residents described external and internalized pressure to maintain a full workload, resulting in regrets and guilt when complications arose. Others described supportive behaviors from program directors, faculty, and co-residents providing them with the agency to maintain healthy pregnancies. In the Fourth Trimester, interviewees described challenges related to parental leave policies, lactation, and stigma. Long-Term, childcare was a significant challenge; residents described spousal/family support and/or independent wealth as being essential to making parenthood in residency possible. Residents struggled with the &ldquo;moral injury&rdquo; of having inadequate time for both their children and patients. Lack of time also compromised opportunities to build camaraderie with co-residents. Residents described these challenges impacting their career decisions. Programmatic support in this phase was limited to role modeling; practical solutions were lacking.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Although substantial progress has been made in protecting parental leave, significant barriers to parenthood during surgical residency exist. Supportive behaviors from faculty and colleagues counteract stigma surrounding parenthood, particularly during Pregnancy and the Fourth Trimester. Thereafter, however, financial and logistical resources to support resident parents are needed. Due to the apparent necessity of independent financial or familial resources, parenthood may exacerbate socioeconomic disparities and stymie efforts to diversify the field.

Patients age 65 years and older will soon account for 30% of the US population, and they face a significantly higher risk of poor recovery after surgery than younger adults. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of chief resident participation in surgery for this high-risk population. We hypothesized that general surgery operations performed by supervised chief residents, as opposed to attending physicians, would be safe but have longer operative times for older adults.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We used the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to identify patients &ge;65 years old who had a general surgery procedure from 1998-2019. We categorized cases according to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education operative categories: including basic and complex laparoscopy, alimentary tract, amputations, mastectomies, endocrine operations and, abdominal operations. The surgeon of record was classified as either a supervised chief resident or attending physician. We used inverse probability weighting on the propensity score to compare risk-adjusted outcomes, including overall morbidity, mortality, and post-anesthesia care unit and operative time.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Our cohort consisted of 52,830 surgeries (46.1%) by supervised chief residents and 61,695 surgeries (53.9%) performed by attending surgeons. Cases performed by chief residents had an increased complication rate compared to attendings alone (+2.1%, 95% CI 1.2%-3.0%, p&lt;0.001), but there was no difference in 30-day postoperative mortality (+0.2%, 95% CI -0.1%-0.5%, p=0.2). Operative time (+13.3 minutes, 95% CI 6.6-20.1, p&lt;0.001), and post-anesthesia care unit time (+9.2 minutes, 95% CI 1.8-16.6, p=0.02) were both increased when the case was performed by a chief resident, as opposed to an attending.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
When surgery for older adults is performed by a supervised chief resident rather than an attending, there is a small increase in morbidity and time spent in the operating room and post-anesthesia units. However, the difference in risk is not prohibitive and suggests that it is reasonable for chief residents to operate on older adults under appropriate supervision by attending physicians.

Stulberg<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Feinberg School Of Medicine - Northwestern University, Surgical Oncology, Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Effective intraoperative teaching of surgical skills and clinical judgment is essential for the safe and efficient training of surgical residents. Factors influencing surgeons&rsquo; intraoperative teaching strategies are variable. The aims of this study were to (1) describe surgeons&rsquo; intraoperative teaching behaviors, and to (2) identify factors affecting surgeons&rsquo; intraoperative teaching behaviors.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Two researchers conducted direct observations of 6 general surgeons performing open and minimally invasive procedures over the course of 4 months. We used the Intraoperative Surgeons&rsquo; Teaching Behaviors Assessment Tool (ISTBAT) to quantify teaching interactions between surgeons and trainees. In addition, we collected data on surgeons&rsquo; non-technical skills using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) tool, residents&rsquo; level of training, how far they were on their rotation, and we took field notes of the contents of teaching interactions between surgeons and trainees. Deductive thematic analysis was used to group findings from field notes into four categories of ISTBAT (instruction, questioning, guiding, and setting the tone). Descriptive analysis was used to report the frequency of teaching interactions and Pearson correlation to measure the correlation between a surgeons&rsquo; non-technical skills score and frequency of teaching behaviors.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We conducted over 37 hours of observations, which included 18 procedures involving 6 surgeons, 11 residents, and 7 medical students. The most frequent teaching domain used by surgeons was instructional behaviors with a mean of 28.2 (3-67), followed by setting tone behaviors, mean; 4.37 (0-12). Surgeons&rsquo; intraoperative teaching behaviors varied based on residents&rsquo; level of training and familiarity between residents and faculty (Table). There was a moderate positive correlation between surgeons&rsquo; non-technical skills and the frequency of their teaching behaviors (Pearson=0.53, P-value=0.17).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

We observed frequent teaching interactions between surgeons and residents, which varied based on the resident&rsquo;s level of training. There was a moderate correlation between surgeons&rsquo; non-technical skills and their teaching behaviors. Awareness of residents&rsquo; expectations from the operations may help surgeons adapt their teaching skills to meet the residents&rsquo; needs.

The goal of every training program is to graduate surgeons who are ready for independent practice. Concerns exist that increased emphasis on resident wellness may compromise clinical and operative learning. The aims of this study were to (1) describe the relationship between autonomy and well-being and (2) investigate the factors associated with resident perception of autonomy.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We used a convergent mixed-methods design. Quantitative data were collected through a cross-sectional survey administered to general surgery residents following the 2020 ABSITE, querying their perceptions of autonomy (appropriate amount of time in the operating room, clinical autonomy, and operative autonomy), other aspects of the learning environment, and well-being (abbreviated modified Maslach Burnout Inventory, thoughts of leaving, and suicidality). Multivariable logistic regression models with robust standard errors were used to (1) determine the relationship between autonomy and burnout and (2) assess associations between faculty support, resident camaraderie, and autonomy. Qualitative data were collected via interviews and focus groups with residents (11) and faculty (21) during in-person visits to 15 programs. We combined inductive and deductive logics to thematically analyze the transcripts.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of 7233 respondents (85.5% response rate) from all 324 programs, 5408 completed the relevant items. Overall, 82.13% perceived that they had autonomy, and these residents were less likely to experience burnout (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.37-0.51), suicidality (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.49-0.87.), and thoughts of leaving (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.24-0.35). Women were less likely to report autonomy (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.68-0.96). Residents were more likely to report autonomy if they also reported satisfaction with their workload (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.28-2.11), work-life balance (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.56-2.55), faculty engagement (OR 3.55; 95% CI 2.86-4.35), resident camaraderie (OR 2.25; 95% CI, 1.77-2.78), and clinical resources (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.97-2.90). We identified four themes in the qualitative analysis: multiple barriers to autonomy exist, autonomy must be earned, residents must learn processes for earning autonomy, and meaning is found in autonomous clinical performance (Table).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Autonomy is very important for general surgery residents&rsquo; wellness as well as for their training. Women are afforded less operative autonomy than men. Autonomy is not considered an inherent part of the training paradigm; residents must work to earn autonomy from attending surgeons. Resources to help residents spend more time in the operating room and function autonomously should be allocated equitably to support all residents.

In February 2020, the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) announced that the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 would change from a 3-digit score to Pass/Fail (P/F). Step 1 has been considered one of the most important metrics for a medical student&rsquo;s residency application, especially for those applying to competitive surgical specialties. With this change, USMLE Step 2 CK is expected to take on increased importance as the only objective measure for medical students applying to general surgery residency. The purpose of this study was to (1) assess the views of general surgery program directors on the change and (2) determine how the change will impact residency selection criteria. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A survey was distributed to the program directors of all 330 general surgery residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Questions asked about current practices in selecting applicants and how changing Step 1 to P/F would impact the selection crieria presented in the table below. Multiple choice and ranking questions were analyzed using non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 60 program directors (18.1%) completed the survey. 80.0% of program directors surveyed agreed that medical schools should share NBME clerkship exam scores after Step 1 becomes pass/fail (p&lt;0.05), and 56.7% agreed that a medical school&rsquo;s rank will be considered more after Step 1 becomes pass/fail (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, 68.3% disagreed when asked if students would be better prepared clinically after the change (p&lt;0.05). Regarding selection criteria, although Step 2CK was ranked in the top quartile of most important factors when evaluating applicants, it was not ranked significantly higher by program directors after the change. In fact, there was no significant difference in the ranking of any of the 16 selection criteria listed in the survey post P/F Step 1.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
After the change of Step 1 to P/F, medical school rank will have a larger impact on selection criteria. Additionally, shelf exam scores may provide a valuable objective measure of applicants if medical schools decide to share them with residency programs. Finally, our results do not suggest that Step 2 CK will be of any greater importance after the change when compared to other selection criteria used by surgery program directors in previous years.

The impact of these virtual interactions is unknown. We sought to understand their effectiveness according to residency program directors and assistant program directors. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Institutional review board approval was obtained to conduct this anonymous survey. A Qualtrics XM survey containing multiple choice and short-answer questions was distributed to 590 residency program and assistant program directors through the Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) listserv on July 6th, July 13th, and July 20th. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We observed a response rate of approximately 11% across the 590 surgeons contacted. Nearly all (90%) respondents offered virtual pre-interview interactions, primarily virtual open houses, virtual facility tours, and virtual Q&amp;A sessions with residents and faculty. 48% of respondents were unsure of the utility of virtual interactions, and the majority (54%) felt that virtual interaction limits a program&rsquo;s ability to evaluate applicants. Virtual Q&amp;As were ranked to be the most effective interaction (7.6/10). 80% of respondents felt that visiting rotations were &ldquo;somewhat important&rdquo; to &ldquo;very important,&rdquo; the two highest options available. Additionally, 74% felt that applicants missed out on fully experiencing the program by forgoing these rotations. The majority of respondents (78%) noted that evaluation of applicants pre-interview did not change as a result of virtual interactions. Nearly half (48%) of respondents offered more interview days due to the virtual format. A fifth (21%) of respondents stated that virtual interactions resulted in a change in the rank position of an applicant. Respondents ranked Twitter and Instagram higher in applicant engagement than Facebook. Factors that impacted interview or rank order list most were late/absent step 2 CK scores (33%) and a lack of away rotations (31%), both being limitations largely due to the pandemic. With respect to future application cycles, most (71%) raised concerns regarding disparities between applicants applying in-person and virtually if both or either are offered. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our study suggests that program directors and associate program directors have reservations about the use of virtual interactions with applicants. Interestingly, this data suggests that away rotations are helpful for programs, adding some clarity to the debate surrounding medical students with access to limited resources participating in away rotations.

However, there is minimal data describing resident and faculty experience and attitudes regarding this transition. This study sought to assess the adoption of a virtual format for education conferences using an anonymous survey. We hypothesized that residents and faculty will report a preference for virtual conferences compared to in-person.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An internally validated 25 question online survey was anonymously distributed from March, 2021 through April, 2021 to all faculty and resident physicians in the Department of Surgery at a single academic medical center after IRB approval. Questions included the environment where conferences were attended and perceptions about virtual education compared to in-person. Descriptive statistics were performed as well as bivariate comparisons between residents and faculty responses.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Fifty four of 79 (68%) potential respondents completed the entire survey (faculty=28/41 (68%); resident physician 26/38 (68%)) and represent the denominator for all subsequent responses. Of respondents, 63% reported attending weekly virtual conferences at the same rate as in person conferences. Whereas 30% attended more frequently and 11% less frequently. 70% of all respondents reported attending on a private computer, 13% on a phone, and 11% with a group on a computer. Overall, 30% of respondents had their camera on during conferences. However, when compared to residents, faculty had their cameras on more frequently (46% vs 12%, p=0.006). Half of all respondents stated they are participating in another concurrent activity most of the time or always. The most reported simultaneous activities were: answering emails/calls (57%), writing notes, answering pages or patient care (56%), researching conference related material (39%), and driving (37%). Compared to in-person conferences, 37% of participants reported being more distracted by other activities. Nevertheless, 78% of participants strongly agreed that virtual conferences are more flexible. When comparing faculty to residents, 100% of faculty wanted conferences to continue virtually (with or without an in-person component) citing virtual conferences being more flexible and saves travel time. While the majority of residents agreed, four (15%) residents responded they did not want to continue virtual education citing work distractions and lack of protected time from patient care responsibilities (p=0.004).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, virtual education will likely proceed in an effort to help curb spread of disease. Therefore, it is helpful to see the support from both residents and faculty in favor of virtual conferences which is mostly due to flexibility and convivence. However, care must be taken to make sure that resident education time is truly protected.

Decreased autonomy is one of the reasons cited for decreasing resident readiness for independent practice. We sought to examine the change in operative resident autonomy for emergency ACS cases over time and outcomes relative to operative autonomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Utilizing the VASQIP database, we examined all ACS cases (emergency general, vascular, and thoracic) at all Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals from 2004-2019. All cases at the VA are coded for level of supervision at the time of surgery: (AP) attending primary surgeon; (AR) attending and resident both operating and (RP) resident primary (attending supervising but not scrubbed). Baseline demographics, operative variables, and outcomes were compared between groups. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over the 15-year study period, 66,008 total ACS cases were performed (79% general, 18% vascular, 3% thoracic); with 28% AP, 65% AR and 7% RP. From 2004 to 2019, the proportion of ACS RP cases decreased from 9.9 to 4.1%; during the same period, elective RP cases decreased from 8.9% to 2.9%. The most common ACS RP surgeries were appendectomy (24% lap, 5% open), amputations (6% guillotine BKA, 3% AKA, and 2% BKA), and cholecystectomy (5% lap, 1% open). RP cases had less severe comorbidities compared to AP and AR comparing ASA class. There was no difference in mortality between supervision groups even after adjusting for comorbidities. Adjusted morbidity was higher in AR compared to AP (OR 1.16 (1.11-1.22)), with no difference for RP cases. Adjusted return to OR was higher in AR compared to AP (OR 1.08 (1.02-1.14)) with no difference for RP cases.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: ACS cases showed a significant decrease in resident autonomy over the past 15 years; this decrease is comparable to the decrease in elective cases over the same time frame. Resident autonomy, even when adjusted for comorbidities, does not negatively impact outcomes. While the decline in resident autonomy has not improved patient outcomes even in emergency cases; it does negatively impact surgical education. Therefore, it is imperative we allow operative autonomy to better prepare graduating residents for independent practice.

Over six academic years, between July 2015 and June 2020, 43 surgeons (9 female and 34 male) supervised and intraoperatively assessed the performance of 46 residents (28 male, 18 female) using validated Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) and Zwisch Operative Autonomy (ROA) assessments. The latter is a 4-point scale describing faculty supervision behaviors associated with different degrees of resident autonomy (1: show &amp; help, 2: active help, 3: passive help, and 4: supervision only). Resident readiness to perform procedures independently (RRI) was assessed. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics with categorical variables reported as frequencies and percentages.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 1,464 elective procedures were performed by residents at different postgraduate years (PGY) supervised by faculty as follows; 279 (19.1%) by PGY1 residents, 338 (23.1%) by PGY2, 331 (22.6%) by PGY3, 224 (15.3%) by PGY4, and 292 (19.9%) by PGY5. Correlational analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between RRI, OSATS, operative autonomy scores, and resident preparation. Results indicated positive correlation between RRI and summative OSATS score (r=0.510, p&lt;0.001) and ROA (r=0.473, p&lt;0.001). There was a strong relation between RRI and PGY (r=0.535, p&lt;0.001). The proportion ratings of overall RRI increased from 7.5% at PGY1 to 16.1% at PGY2, 29.1% at PGY3, 56.9% at PGY4, and 78.7% at PGY5. Meaningful autonomy ratings (3: passive help, and 4: supervision only) increased from 22.7% at PGY1 to 49.8% at PGY2, 65.6% at PGY3, 79.1% at PGY4, to 89.5% at PGY5. At PGY5, proportion ratings of RRI vary based on the ACGME procedure category (83% for abdominal, 81.8% for alimentary tract, 91% for endocrine, 85% for endoscopy, and 43% for vascular procedures). Additionally, proportion ratings of RRI vary based on case difficulty from 96.1% for basic, to 83.3% for advanced, and 74.7% for complex cases.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Although resident readiness to perform procedures independently increases with years of training, there is a wide variation when considering the specialty/ACGME procedure category and the complexity of cases. The residents&rsquo; technical skills play a crucial role in the residents&rsquo; readiness and granting operative autonomy. Specialty fellowships are an integral component of postgraduate training to address the gap in ACGME categories where graduation cannot reach appropriate independence

Surveillance of perioperative bleeding complications is primarily done through manual chart review which covers only 10-15% of all operations. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a diagnostic model for perioperative bleeding complications using structured electronic health records (EHR) data to augment or replace manual chart review.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients who underwent operations at one of five hospitals within our local health system between 2015-2019 were included. EHR data were linked to outcomes data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). NSQIP outcomes are ascertained through manual chart review of only ~10% of all operations. EHR predictors included diagnosis codes, procedure names, and medications prescribed within 30 days of the operation (~11,000 predictors). Bleeding events were identified in NSQIP if they occurred within 30 days of the operation. The knockoff filter with lasso penalty was used to develop a parsimonious model in a training set of operations up to October 2017. The knockoff filter controls type I error by creating null control variables that mimic the original data and are created without looking at the outcome variable. Performance of each model was tested in a held-out dataset of patients who underwent operations between October 2017 through November 2019.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
18,143 patients were included for analysis; 12 predictor variables were included in the model. When applied to the test set, specificity was 93%, sensitivity was 94%, area under the curve was 98%, and accuracy was 93%. Model calibration was evaluated by calibration plots for both the training and test sets. Predicted percentages were combined into six bins and were plotted against the percent of patients with a bleeding complication in each of those bins (Figure 1). Calibration was consistent in the patients with lower predicted risk, whereas the model slightly overpredicted risk in some patients.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The knockoff filter was successfully used to create a parsimonious model for identifying patients with bleeding complications. This model can be used to augment manual chart review for surveillance and reporting of perioperative bleeding complications, enabling inclusion of all surgeries in quality improvement efforts.

Distinct from mentorship, sponsorship requires leaders to use their influence to provide opportunities for mentees that they would otherwise not have. Although mentorship has been well studied in academic surgery, less is known about sponsorship and its impact on academic productivity. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of sponsorship on traditional measures of academic success among trainees (i.e., residents and fellows) and faculty in academic surgery programs across the U.S.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We designed a cross-sectional web-based survey that was disseminated in December 2020 to residents, fellows, and faculty surgeons across 16 academic institutions in the U.S. Sponsorship was defined as advocacy on behalf of a more junior person for career advancement. We performed negative binomial regressions to evaluate the association of sponsorship on the traditional metrics of academic success such as total number of publications and academic productivity (i.e., leadership positions held, number of awards received, editorial boards positions held, invited lectures given, and service-related work positions). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 2,661 eligible respondents, 362 (13.6%) responded to the survey and 242 (9.1%) responded to the items of interest. Two-thirds of all respondents reported having a primary mentor and of those, 163/242 (67.4%) reported receiving at least one form of sponsorship. There was no difference in sponsorship between genders (p=0.56). Individuals who identified as White reported receiving more sponsorship than all other races/ethnicities (Whites 76.7% versus Non-Whites 56.0%, p=0.001). After controlling for race, gender, position, and region of the U.S., we found that sponsorship was significantly associated with total number of publications (IRR 1.78, 95% CI 1.32-2.40, p&lt;0.001) and greater academic productivity (IRR 1.55, 95% CI 1.07-2.24, p=0.021).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: About one-third of academic surgeons with mentors do not receive any form of sponsorship. Additionally, we found that receiving some form of sponsorship was significantly associated with traditional metrics of academic success. More widespread sponsorship can enhance careers and help increase diversity of leaders in academic surgery.

Bronsert<sup>1</sup>, K. Colborn<sup>1</sup>, A. Lambert-Kerzner<sup>1</sup>, R. Meguid<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, Surgery, Aurora, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Unplanned hospital admission after intended outpatient surgery is an undesirable outcome for patients and healthcare systems alike. Preoperative identification of patients at high risk for unplanned admission after outpatient surgery could ensure optimal care delivery, avoid stresses on free-standing outpatient surgical centers, and facilitate bed utilization planning. The purpose of this study was to develop a parsimonious prediction model that estimates a patient&rsquo;s risk of unplanned conversion from outpatient surgery to inpatient hospitalization and to define a high-risk population for this outcome.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This was a retrospective analysis using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database, 2005-2018. Conversion from outpatient to inpatient surgery was defined as patients having outpatient surgery and &gt;1 day hospital length of stay. The Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System (SURPAS) model for predicting outpatient to inpatient conversion was developed using multiple logistic regression of preoperative variables within the ACS-NSQIP database. This was compared to the full 28-variable model including all preoperative, non-laboratory ACS-NSQIP variables. The SURPAS model was developed using a training dataset (2005-2016) and tested using a held-out testing dataset (2017-2018). Performance statistics and Hosmer-Lemeshow plots of observed to expected events were compared. Two definitions of a patient being high-risk for conversion from outpatient to inpatient were then compared: 1) the maximum Youden index, which maximizes sensitivity and specificity, and 2) the cohort above the tenth decile of risk on the Hosmer-Lemeshow plot. The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), and accuracies for each definition were calculated and compared.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

3,004,390 patients were included undergoing outpatient surgery; 3.8% of patients had outpatient surgery unexpectedly converted to inpatient status. The 7 variable SURPAS model performed almost as well as the 28-variable model at accurately predicting outpatient to inpatient conversion (c-indices=0.813 vs. 0.819; Brier scores=0.0328 vs. 0.0326, respectively). SURPAS maintained good performance on internal validation testing (c-index=0.810, Brier score=0.0356). The 10<sup>th</sup> decile of risk definition had higher specificity, PPV, and accuracy than the maximum Youden index definition, while having a lower sensitivity and NPV. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The parsimonious SURPAS model can accurately predict a patient&rsquo;s risk of unplanned conversion from outpatient surgery to inpatient hospitalization. Two slightly different groups of patients at high-risk of conversion were defined. Predicted high-risk patients should be considered for inpatient surgery to avoid unplanned admission, while the lower risk patients could safely undergo operations at outpatient surgery centers.

Dimick<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan, Department Of Surgery, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Out-of-pocket spending is on the rise for individuals with commercial health insurance, yet little is known about the unintended consequences that high levels of cost-sharing may have on health and overall spending. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the association between enrollment in a high-deductible health plan and delayed presentation for common and costly emergency surgical conditions.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In this retrospective analysis of claims data from a large commercial insurer, we identified 18-64yo patients old admitted through the emergency department for one of four common emergency surgical diagnoses: acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, acute diverticulitis, and intestinal obstruction, between October 2015-December 2018. Our primary exposure was enrollment in a high-deductive health insurance plan (HDHP), as opposed to a standard health plan. The primary outcome was a binary determination of &ldquo;complex presentation&rdquo;--determined using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes that were present on admission and based on validated measures of either anatomic complexity (e.g. perforation, abscess, diffuse peritonitis) or physiologic complexity (e.g. shock, sepsis, acidosis). Secondary outcomes included length of stay, inpatient complications, discharge disposition, out-of-pocket spending by patients, and total spending by payers.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 44,278 patients (mean age 48.5y; 52% female) who were admitted through the ED with an emergency surgical condition, 21.8% were enrolled in HDHPs. Despite being younger, having a higher income, and higher education attainment, patients in HDHPs were more likely to present with complex disease (30.2% vs 25.6%, p&lt;0.001) than those in standard health plans, even after adjusting for relevant demographics (adjusted OR 1.17 [95%CI: 1.11-1.24]). Regardless of plan type, presenting with complex disease (vs simple presentation) was associated with longer length of stay (4.5 &plusmn;3.9 days vs 3.2 &plusmn;2.9 days), higher rate of complications (13.8% vs 5.5%), higher out-of-pocket spending ($3,379 vs $2,907), and higher total payer spending ($30,831 vs $26,697) (p&lt;0.05 for all).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Despite being in better baseline health, patients enrolled in high-deductible health plans are more likey to have complex presentations for common emergency surgical conditions. Complex presentation results in worse outcomes for patients and higher costs for payers. Although cost-sharing is typically thought to optimize the use of healthcare services without welfare loss to patients or payers, this is not true for many common and costly conditions. These findings highlight the need for a more value-based insurance design to optimize patient outcomes and minimize costs to payers.

Most existing institutional efforts to promote appropriate prescribing are based on consensus prescribing guidelines, with minimal integration at the point-of-care, infrequent feedback to prescribers and inconsistent outcome evaluation. We designed a set of interventions that are: 1) built upon constantly-updated patient opioid consumption data, 2) designed to inform prescribing patterns at the point-of-care and 3) offer real-time feedback to providers on prescribing habits. We measured the impact of our interventions on opioid prescribing in our surgical department.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: From 2019-2021, we deployed the following interventions in the Department of Surgery at one academic institution: 1) an automatic SMS system for collecting prospective post-discharge opioid consumption data from all patients undergoing surgery, 2) automated feedback emails for providers who write disproportionately large prescriptions as informed by the constantly-updated post-discharge opioid consumption database. We successfully implemented these two opioid prescribing interventions and created a self-perpetuating and automated workflow, with substantial engagement throughout the department.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 12,130 surgical patients were surveyed for their post-discharge opioid consumption via our SMS system from March 2019-July 2021. 21% of patients responded to the SMS survey with opioid consumption data. We previously validated the collection of opioid consumption data via our automatic SMS system relative to a prior validated telephone survey of post-surgical opioid consumption at our institution. For any prescriptions exceeding the 75th percentile of consumption for the respective procedure, feedback emails were automatically sent to the prescriber within 24 hours. During the study period, feedback emails were sent for 1,086 of 11,540 (9.4%) total opioid prescriptions. Implementation of this rapid feedback loop had a significant impact on prescribing practices: the weekly percentage of opioid prescription sizes exceeding the 75th percentile of procedure-specific consumption decreased from 69% at the beginning of the study period to 19% at the end of the study period. Keys to success included early stakeholder outreach and engagement, automated data collection, point-of-care integration with self-perpetuating workflows, automated feedback and incremental impact measurement.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Leveraging actual post-discharge opioid consumption data, we successfully designed and implemented an evidence-based, real-time feedback system for improving postoperative opioid prescribing at the point-of-care. Efforts to sustainably change outlier prescriber practices and curb inappropriate post-surgical opioid prescribing may consider leveraging these interventions and similar automated designs.

Zeiger<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>National Cancer Institute, Surgical Oncology, Bethesda, MD, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Much has been written about the under-representation of women in academic medicine. However, no single study has comprehensively described the gender-based trends of NIH funding for women across different surgical specialties; this study provides such an overview.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We queried a previously created database of NIH-funded surgeons to identify both men and women surgeon-scientists. Surgical specialties and subspecialties were determined based upon board certifications, fellowship training, and online faculty web pages. Total grant costs and average costs per R01 and K grants were calculated and compared by gender for all surgical specialties and subspecialties. Bivariate chi-squared analyses were performed using population totals with JMP (v14.0.0).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
From 2010 to 2020, the proportion of women surgeon-scientists trended towards an increase in all surgical specialties, except orthopedic surgery (13% to 7%) and otolaryngology (17% to 16%). The increase was found to be statistically significant for urology (11% to 18%; p&lt;0.05) and vascular surgery (23% to 40%; p&lt;0.05). In 2020, the specialties with the highest proportion of women surgeon-scientists were obstetrics and gynecology (Ob-Gyn) (57%), vascular surgery (40%), and ophthalmology (29%) (Figure 1a), whereas the general surgery-derived subspecialties with the highest proportion of women surgeon-scientists were surgical oncology (breast) (85%), endocrine surgery (58%), and colorectal surgery (40%) (Figure 1b). Analysis of total grant costs awarded to women and men surgeon-scientists in 2020 revealed that in most specialties and subspecialties, the proportion of funding held by women was substantially less than the proportion of women investigators (Figure 1a &amp; b). In Ob-Gyn, women comprised 57% of the funded surgeons but held only 46% of the funding. Similarly, in subspecialties such as surgical oncology (breast), women comprised 85% of surgeon-scientists but held only 45% of the funding. In contrast, women comprised 58% of the population of funded endocrine surgeons but held 64% of the total funding awarded to endocrine surgeon-scientists. Women and men had similar changes in average total cost per R01 and K grant awarded from 2010 to 2020 in most specialties, except for cardiothoracic surgery and neurosurgery. In these specialties, women had significantly increased funding per R01 grant compared to men.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In summary, while women surgeon-scientists have made significant advances as far as funding representation and per-grant costs in some surgical specialties, they continue to lag in others. An in-depth analysis of the factors contributing to these trends is necessary to achieve gender parity across all academic surgery specialties.

Nichol<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Wisconsin, Surgery, Madison, WI, USA&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>Beyond Clean, Lancaster, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Sterile processing is an essential, yet often overlooked, aspect of surgical operations. An efficient and efficacious sterile processing department is critical for maintaining sterile instruments without disrupting the operating room schedule. Despite the importance of their role, most surgeons know little about those employed in sterile processing departments. To better understand the education level of, and advocate for, sterile processing employees, we conducted a survey of the educational background and continuing education of sterile processing employees.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Following IRB approval, sterile processing affiliates were sent a voluntary survey about work and educational history. Surveys were sent via an email list (&gt;50,000 individuals) created and maintained by a sterile processing education and consulting organization. Data was collected and maintained on the Qualtrics platform and analyzed for descriptive statistics using built-in tools.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, there were 878 respondents. The average age was 47 years, 67% were women and 86% reported working as hospital employees. The average length of employment was 13.5 years. Half (50%) reported working as technicians, 17% were supervisors, 16% were managers, and 4% were educators. The minority of respondents held a 2-year (19%) or 4-year (21%) college degree. Half of respondents (50%) had post-high school training in sterile processing, with an average of 7.2 months of training. Nearly all respondents (92%) held some form of sterile processing certification. Those with formal training or certifications in sterile processing were not more likely to have a higher-ranking position. On average, directors and managers worked in sterile processing longer than supervisors and technicians and were more likely to have 4-year, master, or doctoral degrees when compared with lower-ranking employees. Although higher-ranking employees were more likely than technicians to have completed leadership courses, employees overall were significantly less likely to complete leadership courses if they were not provided or reimbursed by their institution.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The variation in formal training and certification among employees in sterile processing indicates a lack of a standardized curriculum on a national level. Managers and directors were more likely to hold a 4-year, master, or doctoral degree, suggesting a divergence from other fields, such as nursing or supply chain, as there are no 4-year, master, or doctoral degrees in sterile processing. This data suggests little incentive to obtain formal training or additional certifications that may improve the quality of sterile processing. Moreover, defining a more unified education structure may allow employees greater and more equitable opportunities for advancement in the field, leading to overall improvement in efficiency, safety, and performance in sterile processing.

Nichol<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin, School Of Medicine And Public Health, Department Of Surgery, Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Sterile processing (SP) departments are responsible for the repair, sterilization, storage, and transport of all surgical instruments. Due to limited resources and intrinsic inefficiencies, surgical instrument errors (SIEs) by SP result in waste and lost capacities; however, their cost and impact on operating room (OR) efficiency remain unmeasured. We hypothesized that SIEs were substantially underreported and a major source of waste and lost capacities in the OR.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: IRB exemption was obtained for this study. To test this hypothesis, SIEs across nine surgical specialties at a full-service children&rsquo;s hospital with 8 operating rooms were recorded via direct observation by 24 trained observers between June 2021 and August 2021. Data collection took place Monday-Friday between 7:30 AM and 5:00 PM. Type of SIE, instruments affected, work-around method, and length of surgical delays were recorded. SIE types included: failed sterilization/bioburden, missing instruments, damaged instruments, assembly and packaging errors, and fleet management. Delays were defined as the time required to execute a work-around if the error required one. An elective OR day (EOD) was defined as one weekday, non-holiday day in one OR from 7:30 AM and 5:00 PM.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 254 SIEs were recorded in 154 EODs (1.65 errors/EOD). Missing instrument was the most common SIE (n = 148), followed by broken instrument (n = 55), assembly or packaging error (n = 18), wrong instrument (n = 11), failed sterilization/bioburden (n = 8), fleet management (n = 7), extra instrument (n = 6), and transport error (n = 1). SIEs were also analyzed by specialty with an emphasis on those specialties with the largest sample size: SIEs in plastics (n = 46), orthopedics (n = 43), ophthalmology (n = 42), general (n = 31), ENT (n = 31), and urology (n = 20). Surgical delays due to SIE occurred at a rate of 0.39 delays/SIE and averaged 4:27 &plusmn; 11:12 (min:sec). Average length of delay was also analyzed by specialty: orthopedics (6:25 &plusmn; 17:58), plastics (3:55 &plusmn; 5:30), ophthalmology (2:47 &plusmn; 3:46), general (1:30 &plusmn; 1:17), ENT (4:40 &plusmn; 10:43), and urology (1:49 &plusmn; 1:56).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Surgical instrument errors are prevalent and significantly impact OR efficiency. Our analysis of 154 EODs represents 1.5% of annual EODs (10,373) in our two-hospital campus that shares 41 ORs and a SP department. Extrapolating the measured error rate (1.65 errors/EOD) and delay rate (0.39 delays/error) for our campus there are approximately 17,048 SIEs annually resulting in 29,586 minutes of delays. At $153/OR minute, the cost of these SIEs is $4,526,727. Significant improvements in the management of surgical instruments (accurate detection of bioburden, inspection for damage, instrument tracking) will need to be implemented to address the financial waste created in our current SP system.

While proponents of such consolidation argue that it can improve care coordination and quality, vertical integration may also lead to excess utilization, as SNFs are paid a per diem rate. We examined the effects of hospital network ownership of SNFs on the rates of SNF utilization and 30-day episode costs. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a cross-sectional study of fee-for-service Medicare patients undergoing total hip replacement in 2016-2017 at hospital systems identified in the American Hospital Association Annual Survey. We analyzed the association between hospital system ownership of SNFs and discharge to SNF (versus home or home health). We also calculated risk- and price-adjusted 30-day episode payments. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were used to adjust for patient factors such as demographics and comorbidities, and hospital factors such as annual case volume and for-profit status. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 144,126 patients underwent hip replacement during the study period with a mean age of 74 years and 61% female patients. Among 62,673 patients undergoing surgery at a hospital with ownership of any SNF, 14,642 (23%) were discharged to a SNF. Among 81,453 patients undergoing surgery at a hospital with no financial relationship to a SNF, 17,645 (22%) were discharged to a SNF. After adjusting for patient and hospital factors, hospital SNF ownership was significantly but modestly associated with discharge to a SNF (OR 1.09 (95% CI 1.06-1.12). 30-day episode payments were not substantially different for patients undergoing a hip replacement in a hospital network that owned a SNF compared to those that did not ($20,251 [95% CI $20,197-20,305] vs. $20,417 [95% CI $20,370-$20,464], p&lt;.001). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Hospital network ownership of a SNF was found to be modestly associated with increased SNF utilization by Medicare beneficiaries after elective hip repair. Total costs were minimally decreased in hospital networks that owned a SNF. Patients undergoing surgery at hospitals that own SNFs are not significantly more likely to utilize SNFs after hip replacement.

SF can be divided into isolated sternal fractures (ISF) or polytrauma sternal fractures (PSF). Patients with PSF often require hospital admission, whereas ISF patients may be safely discharged from the Emergency Department (ED). However, Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma guidelines recommend screening all SF patients for blunt cardiac injury (BCI) with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and serum troponin. If either test is abnormal, 24-hour telemetry monitored admission is recommended. This study sought to identify the incidence of cardiac complications and procedures in ISF patients with an abnormal ECG. We hypothesized no complications or procedures would occur more than six hours after arrival, thereby demonstrating a population of ISF patients that may be able to undergo abbreviated ED monitoring and avoid unnecessary hospital admission.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective (January 2018-August 2020) quality improvement pilot study was performed at a single Level I Trauma Center. Patients who sustained ISF, defined as SF with an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) score &lt;2 for head/neck, face, abdomen, and extremities, were included. Patients with multiple rib fractures, pneumothorax, or hemothorax were excluded. Demographic and injury data were collected along with ECG, troponin, and echocardiogram (echo) results. Primary outcomes included cardiac related complication or procedure related to BCI. Cardiac related complications included hypotension, arrhythmia, and hemodynamic instability. Procedures included sternal stabilization surgery, cardiac catherization, sternotomy, or thoracotomy. Descriptive statistics were performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 129 ISF patients, 115 (89%) occurred after an MVC. For all ISF patients the mean hospital length of stay was 32.11 hours and the mean chest AIS was 2.12 (SD 0.68). Abnormality on ECG occurred in 68 patients (52.7%) with the most common abnormality being arrythmia (18.6%) and bundle branch block (15.5%). Troponin elevation was seen in eight patients (6.2%). One patient (0.78%) suffered a cardiac related complication (arrhythmia), however this occurred 82 hours after hospital arrival. Two patients had non-cardiac complications (urinary tract infection and acute kidney injury) within six hours (1.55%). There were no procedures related to BCI. Echo was done for 10 patients (7.69%) with 3 having an abnormality (2.33%). No BCI was found in any of the ISF patients and 90% of patients were discharged home.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: After ISF, &lt; 1% of patients suffered a cardiac related complication more than six hours after hospital arrival and no patients had a BCI. These findings suggest current guidelines recommending 24-hour monitoring for patients with ISF and abnormal ECG may be unnecessarily long. However, a prospective multicenter study to evaluate the validity of these results is needed prior to change in practice.

The value and timing of early postoperative CT in patients with head surgery after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is scarcely addressed.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Our IRB approved retrospective cohort study included 353 patients with blunt TBI admitted to two urban level 1 Trauma Centers who underwent emergency head procedure (craniotomy, craniectomy, burr hole) and postoperative head CT within 24 hours. Analyzed variables included: age, gender, mechanism of injury (MOI), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Marshall score, Abbreviated Injury Score for head (AISh), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, CT findings and timing, neurological examination dynamics, type of surgery, intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay (ICULOS, HLOS), and mortality. TBI was defined as AISh &ge;2, intracranial hemorrhage or skull fracture.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Mean age of patients was 61.9 years, 61.8% were male, and falls were the dominant MOI (70.5%). Mean values at admission were: ISS 25.1; GCS 11.0; AISh 4.7; Marshall Score 3.3; ASA 3.6. Craniotomy was performed in 79.8% of patients, followed by craniectomy (13.3%) and burr hole (6.8%). Negative CT changes after first head surgery (progressions of intracranial lesion, re-bleeding, contralateral injury, or new lesion finding) were observed in 40.5% of patients, while negative neurological dynamic was observed in 31.4% [Figure 1]. Mean time to first post-operative CT was 5.4 hours. Analysis of post-operative CT timing revealed that in 41.0% of cases CT was done within 1 hour after surgery, in 59.2% within 2 hours, in 65.1% within 6 hours. Second head surgery was performed in 12.2% of patients, who all had negative changes on CT, however only 27.9% of them had deterioration in neurological status. Mean ICULOS was 8.0 days and HLOS of 17.0 days. Overall mortality was 24.6%, including in-hospital mortality of 10.2% and 14.4% discharge to hospice. Multivariable analysis showed age, GCS, Marshall and ASA scores as significant predictors of mortality.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Postoperatively, in TBI patients with CT scanning done within 24 hours, negative CT changes were observed in 41% and were not always paralleled by deterioration of neurological status (31% of patients). Negative dynamic detected on early postoperative CT allowed prompt treatment adjustments, including second head surgery. In patients with severe TBI, early, routine post-operative head CT remains a valid diagnostic procedure allowing for accurate and timely diagnostic of negative intracranial changes and preventing delay of secondary intervention.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) management includes serial neurologic exams to detect changes which could indicate an enlarged intracranial hemorrhage and the need for neurosurgical interventions. We hypothesized hourly exams are over-assigned and contribute unnecessary burden to nursing staff and patients. We conducted a decision-tree analysis to determine an algorithm to judiciously assign hourly exams.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective cohort study of 1022 patients with TBI admitted to a Level 1 trauma center from 1/1/2019-12/31/2019 was conducted. Patients with penetrating TBI, immediate or planned neurosurgical interventions and those with non-survivable injuries were excluded. Patients were stratified by whether they underwent an unplanned, urgent intervention (e.g. craniotomy or invasive intracranial monitoring) during their hospital stay. Univariate analysis identified factors for inclusion in chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) technique classifying those at risk for unplanned procedures.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
830 patients were included, 35% (n=287) were assigned hourly (Q1) exams, and 17 (2%) had unplanned procedures with 16/17 (94%) on Q1 exams. Patients requiring unplanned procedures were more likely to have complex intracranial hemorrhage (82% vs 39%, p=0.001), midline shift (35% vs 14%, p=0.023), an initial poor neurologic exam (GCS&le;8, 77% vs 14%, p&lt;0.001) and be intubated (88% vs 17%, p&lt;0.001). Using CHAID, the decision-tree demonstrated low risk (2% misclassification) and excellent discrimination (AUC=0.915, 95%CI 0.844-0.986, p&lt;0.001) of patients at risk of an unplanned procedure. By following the algorithm, 167 patients could have safely been assigned every 2 hour exams instead of Q1, resulting in an estimated 6,012 fewer exams.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Using a 4-factor algorithm can optimize the assignment of neuro exams and substantially reduce neuro exam burden without sacrificing patient safety. Q1 exams were assigned to over 1/3 of TBI patients, but only a fraction of these patients experienced an exam change requiring an unplanned neurosurgical procedure.

According to societal guidelines, RT is indicated for patients who suffer cardiac arrest within 15 minutes of penetrating or 10 minutes of blunt trauma and present with signs of life. Current guidelines fail to address the indications of RT in patients who have achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and then arrest for a second time early in presentation. The purpose of this study is to determine if similar outcomes are seen in trauma patients who suffer from arrest after ROSC (AAR). We hypothesize that patients with AAR will have a lower survival rate and poorer neurologic outcome compared to single arrest patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is an IRB approved retrospective review of patients who underwent RT at an urban, level 1 trauma center from 02/01/16 to 12/31/20. Patients were excluded if they were younger than 16 or pregnant. Categorical variables including mortality were analyzed with a chi-square test using a p-value &lt; 0.05 to determine significance. Outcomes including GCS and hospital length of stay (LOS) were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test with a p&lt;0.05. Predictors of survival including GCS were analyzed with a logistic regression model. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 177 eligible patients were identified with 19 patients in the AAR group and 158 patients in the single arrest group (table 1). Survival rate at 24 hours was not statistically different between the two, with 5.3% survival in the AAR group and 9.5% in the single arrest group (p=0.54). At 30 days, there were no survivors in the AAR group compared to 6.3% in the single arrest group (p=0.26). There was no statistically significant difference between GCS on discharge between the two groups (3 versus 3.7, p=0.26). Of note, among all patients who presented without signs of life (n=46), there was 100% mortality (p=0.054).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Little is known about the utility of RT in trauma patients who suffer from arrest after ROSC. This paper sought to examine the characteristics and outcomes of this unique patient population in an effort to contribute towards management guidelines. While limited by small sample size, our findings suggest that the survival benefits of RT are not observed in patients who suffer AAR. Notably, none of the patients who presented without signs of life and underwent RT survived. While this finding just failed to reach statistical significance, it is of substantial clinical significance and underscores the importance of diligent patient selection prior to performing RT.

Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the protocol in reducing opioid use without affecting patient-reported pain scores. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a retrospective review of adult trauma patients initially admitted 7/1-9/30 in 2018 (pre-MMP) and 2019 (post-MMP) at an urban academic level one trauma center. Patients were stratified by level of care upon initial admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or floor as well as by injury severity score (ISS&lt;16 or ISS&ge; 16). Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted using SPSS v. 27.0 (IBM Corp; Armonk, NY). Pain scores, opioid and non-opioid analgesic medication use were compared for the hospital stay or first thirty days of their admission, whichever was shortest to assess execution and efficacy of the MMP.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 798 patients were included with a mean age of 54 &plusmn; 22, and 511 (64.0%) were men. Demographic and clinical characteristics between those in the pre-MMP (n=404) and post-MMP (n=394) groups were not different. The average pain scores were no different between the two groups (3.7 vs 3.8; p = 0.44), but patients in the post-MMP group received 36% fewer morphine milliequivalents (MME) over their hospital course compared to the pre-MMP group (109.6 vs 70; p&lt;.0001). Implementation of the protocol had the largest effect on patients admitted to the ICU, regardless of injury severity (Figure 1). Severely injured (ISS&ge;16) ICU patients had the greatest decrease in MME (174.6 vs. 84.4; p&lt;.0001). Severely injured (ISS&ge;16) floor patients had no significant change in MME administered (64.2 vs. 74.3; p=0.188). Implementation of the protocol also significantly increased the use of non-opioid medications. Use of acetaminophen increased significantly in severely injured (ISS&ge;16) patients admitted to the ICU (1879.1mg/d vs. 2655.7mg/d; p&lt;.0001) and the floor (1682.3mg/d vs. 2305.7mg/d; p&lt;0.0001). Similarly, acetaminophen usage increased significantly in patients with less severe injuries (ISS&lt;16) in the ICU (1735.9mg/d vs. 2336.4mg/d, p&lt;.0001) and the floor (1468.6mg/d vs. 2301.9mg/d, p&lt;.0001). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Implementation of a MMP protocol in the trauma patient population reduces MME utilization and increased the use of non-opioid analgesics without affecting patient reported pain scores. This protocol was equally implemented in critical and non-critical patients as well as patients with varying severity in injuries. Further work to identify optimal MMP by demographics may further reduce opioid usage and identify appropriate discharge prescription recommendations.

Recent advancements in multi-platform, multi-omics permit the profiling of patients based on datasets highly representative of the vast pool of circulating biomolecules. We hypothesized that the absence or presence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) would markedly impact the plasma biomolecules that correlated most with patient survival.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We analyzed admission plasma samples with untargeted metabolomics (Metabolon: 889 metabolites), targeted lipidomics (Metabolon: 998 lipid species), and proteomics (Somalogic: 7000 proteins) from 75 representative polytrauma patients (standard-care arm) enrolled in a trial blinded for submission (mean ISS=27, 39 survivors and 36 non-survivors based 30 day mortality). Patients were categorized based on the presence of brain injury: No brain injury (NBI; n=32, 20 survivors, 12 non-survivors, mean ISS=20) or with brain injury (TBI; n=43, 19 survivors, 24 non-survivors, mean ISS=32). Using a LASSO/SVM model, we identified a minimal set of biomolecules (derived from the overall list of 8,895) with high predictive value for 30-day survival in the NBI and TBI subgroups. Model significance was assessed through both permutation testing and random feature selection.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We separated patients by the absence or presence of brain injury due to known confounding effects of TBI and ISS. In the NBI group, 6 proteins, 17 metabolites, and 12 lipids measured at admission showed significant predictive value between survivors and non-survivors. The LASSO/SVM model had a mean classification accuracy of 93.8% in a k-fold cross-validation framework (compared to a 62.5% no-information rate [NIR]). The non-survivor group had higher levels of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides (Kruskal-Wallis, p &lt; 0.02), malate (p &lt; 0.006), and bilirubin degradation products (p &lt; 0.03). Survivors had significantly higher levels of the antimicrobial protein beta-defensin 1 (p &lt; 0.01), protease inhibitor serpin A11 (p &lt; 0.003), and several lipids from different classes (p &lt; 0.02). In those with TBI, 30 proteins, 13 metabolites, and 3 lipids (with only 3 overlapping variables with NBI) showed predictive significance of 72.09% with cross-validation accuracy compared to a 56.52% NIR. Of these markers, neuropeptide N-acetylaspartate was higher (p &lt; 0.0002) in the TBI non-survivors, while pregnenolone steroids were higher (p &lt; 0.001) in survivors.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our multi-platform, multi-omic analysis provides a deep dataset for the identification of injury-specific biomarkers early after severe trauma. The presence of TBI dramatically alters the biomarkers that are associated with 30-day mortality. Prominent among the brain injury-specific biomarkers is the neuropeptide N-acetylaspartate. These findings can guide the development of an admission biomarker panel to identify TBI and prognosticate mortality biomarkers in trauma patients with or without TBI.

Scott<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Michigan, Department Of Surgery, Ann Arbor, MI, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University of Michigan, Institute For Healthcare Policy And Innovation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Traumatic injuries are rapidly becoming a major problem among older adults in the United States. Older patients are uniquely at risk for devastating long-term sequelae after injury because of baseline medical comorbidities, functional limitations, and limited social support. Although this injury may affect every domain of their lives including physical health, mental health, functional independence, and social well-being, these lasting impacts are not captured in clinical trauma registries. In this study, we utilized a nationally representative longitudinal survey dataset to study the long-lasting impact of traumatic injuries among older adults.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We used inpatient Medicare claims linked to the Health and Retirement Study to identify individuals 65 and older who were admitted for a traumatic injury with the New Injury Severity Score (NISS) of 4 or greater between 1998-2016, based on ICD-9 and-10 codes. Patients without survey responses within 1000 days of index admission were excluded. To explore the multi-faceted impact of injuries on patients&rsquo; health, we evaluated physical health, mental health, functional independence, and social support using indicative measures of self-reported health status, depression, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) composite score, and nursing home residence respectively. To evaluate the impact of injury on these outcomes, pre-injury scores were compared to post-injury scores using the student&rsquo;s t-test and chi-square tests as indicated.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified 1,681 older adults meeting study criteria with the following demographics: median age of 82 (IQR: 75-88), 69% female, 93% White race, 5% Black race, 2% other race, and 5% Hispanic ethnicity. Median injury severity score was 17.1 (IQR: 7.4-17.8). Pre-injury measures of physical health, mental health, functional independence and social support are shown in the Table. Post-injury responses revealed significantly worsening in all four domains of health after the traumatic injury (Table, p&lt;0.05 ).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Among older adults, traumatic injuries have a devastating impact on long-term measures of physical health, mental health, functional independence, and social wellbeing that are not captured in traditional clinical databases. As the burden of trauma among the older adult population continues to increase, policies and programs that could optimize long-term recovery are becoming increasingly important. A better understanding of the contributors to these long-term negative outcomes must be further investigated to provide improved care for this already-vulnerable population.

This event carries an associated increase in mortality, as well as hospital length of stay (LOS) and cost. Prominent organizations, such as the American College of Surgeons, track unplanned ICU admission as a quality benchmark. Hence, trauma teams need to determine which patients necessitate ICU admission on presentation rather than waiting to intervene on deteriorating patients. We sought to develop a novel Clinical Risk of Acute ICU Status during Hospitalization (CRASH) score to predict risk of unplanned ICU admission for trauma patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The 2017 adult Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) database was queried for patients admitted to either the general ward floor or step-down unit. The group was randomly divided into two equal sized sets (derivation and validation sets) and a three-step methodology was used. First, multiple logistic regression models were created to determine the risk of unplanned ICU admission in trauma patients using patient demographics, comorbidities, and injuries; all of which are readily available after initial imaging and work-up. Second, the weighted average and relative impact of each independent predictor was used to derive a CRASH score. The score was validated using AUROC for both the derivation and validation sets.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There was a total of 624,786 trauma patients admitted to the ward or step-down unit. From 312,393 patients in the derivation-set, 3,769 (1.2%) had an unplanned ICU admission. A total of 24 independent predictors of unplanned ICU admission were identified and the CRASH score was derived with scores ranging from 0-32 (Table 1). The unplanned ICU admission rate increased steadily from 0.1% to 3.9% then 12.9% at scores of 0, 6, and 14, respectively (Figure 1). The AUROC for this was 0.78. In the validation-set, unplanned ICU admission was 1.2% and the AUROC remained at 0.78.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The CRASH score is a novel and validated scoring tool to help predict unplanned ICU admission for trauma patients. This tool may help providers admit trauma patients to the appropriate level of care or identify high risk patients to decompensate. Future prospective research is needed to confirm whether the CRASH score decreases the rate of unplanned ICU admissions in clinical practice.

Our study compared TBI patients who underwent an urgent 2<sup>nd</sup> head surgery with patients who had only one urgent head surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Our IRB approved retrospective study included 275 patients with blunt TBI admitted to two level 1 Trauma Centers. Group A included 43 patients who required 2<sup>nd</sup> head surgery and Group B included 232 patients with one emergency head surgery. Analyzed variables were: age, gender, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Marshall score, Abbreviated Injury Scale for head (AISh), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, computed tomography (CT) findings and timing, type of surgery (craniotomy, craniectomy, burr hole), intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay (ICULOS, HLOS), discharge disposition and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Mean age of patients in both groups was 59.6, with similar percentage of geriatric (&ge;65 y.o.) patients (42% vs 47%). Males constituted 62% in both groups. The most common (&gt;80%) TBI type in all patients was a subdural hematoma. Group A compared to Group B had significantly higher ISS (26.1 vs 24.2), Marshall score (3.6 vs 3.1), AISh (4.8 vs 4.6) and ASA (3.8 vs 3.4) prior to 1<sup>st</sup> head surgery, all p&lt;0.03 [Figure 1]. GCS did not reach significant difference (10.6 vs 12.0, p=0.05). Mean time from admission to 1<sup>st</sup> head surgery was statistically shorter in Group A (10 vs 23 hours, p=0.002). Mean time from 1<sup>st</sup> head surgery to 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative CT was comparable (5.2 vs 5.9 hours, p=0.5). Negative dynamic on 1<sup>st</sup> CT after 1<sup>st</sup> surgery was significantly more often in Group A (61 vs 27%, p&lt;0.001). Most common (&gt;80%) surgery in both groups was craniotomy and in 40% of cases 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery was done within 24 hours of the 1<sup>st</sup>. Significantly more patients in Group A required tracheostomies (35% vs 18%, p=0.009). ICULOS and HLOS were significantly longer in Group A (13 vs 7 days; and 30 vs 16 days, both p&lt;0.001). After 2<sup>nd</sup> head surgery, 7% of patients expired in hospital, 12% went to hospice, 58% to rehab or long term care hospital and 23% went home. Multivariable analysis showed Marshall Score as an independent predictor of 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery, and Receiver Operator Characteristics analysis showed threshold value of 4.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Second head surgery was done in 12% of blunt TBI patients. These patients had higher Marshall, AISh, and ASA scores at admission compared to patients with one surgery. Negative changes on early first post-operative CT were detected in 61% of patients who underwent second head surgery. Marshall Score was an independent predictor of 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery. In patients with a Marshall Score of 4, mandatory postoperative CT within 6 hours is recommended.

Preoperative transfusion rates have been previously studied of these polytraumatic injuries, but to the authors&rsquo; knowledge there has been little research into the preoperative hemorrhage of acetabular fractures in isolation. The Judet and Letournel system is the most widely used system for the classification of acetabular fractures, however, the effect of different fracture patterns on blood loss has not been previously established. The objective of this study was to properly identify the amount of preoperative blood loss associated with different types of isolated acetabular fractures.

Exclusion criteria included nonoperative management, surgical intervention greater than three days from injury, intra-abdominal injury requiring exploratory laparotomy or high-grade hepatic and splenic lacerations requiring angiographic embolization, thoracic injuries requiring surgical treatment, long bone fractures except for pilon or ankle type fractures, pelvic ring fractures, and sacroiliac joint diastasis or sacral fractures. Patient body mass index, gender, mechanism of injury, preoperative hemoglobin values, and preoperative transfusions were collected. Preoperative blood loss was calculated and analyzed based on fracture pattern and patient variables.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the initial 1,159 patients, 608 were included for analysis. Of the 608 patients, 438 were male. The mean preoperative blood loss of all fractures was 1,148.6mL (&plusmn;652). The three fracture patterns with the greatest mean preoperative blood loss were both column, T-Type + posterior wall, and both column + posterior wall fractures with calculated volumes of 1,401.9mL, 1,832.4mL, and 1,847.6mL respectively. There was a significant difference among fracture patterns and preoperative blood loss. Acetabular fracture pattern, preoperative blood loss, and time from injury to surgery have significant associations with preoperative transfusion. Estimated preoperative blood volume, BMI, gender, and mechanism of injury were not associated with preoperative transfusions.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Given the known risks and complications of transfusions, the establishment of anticipated preoperative blood loss for isolated acetabular fracture types is of great research importance. This study sheds light on preoperative blood loss seen in acetabular fractures and may improve a provider&rsquo;s assessment and management of hemodynamic status when considering the use of blood products and antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid.

However, these studies generally exclude high-risk patients with spinal cord injury, thus there is a paucity of information regarding appropriate timing for initiation of chemical prophylactic anticoagulation in traumatic spinal injury patients requiring surgery, especially given the concerns for spinal bleeding in the post-operative period. Herein, we evaluated the incidence of spinal bleeding including hematoma in patient&rsquo;s receiving spinal surgery in the setting of spinal trauma based on timing of chemical VTE prophylaxis initiation -within 2 days of surgery or after 3 days.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective cohort study of trauma spinal injury patients at an academic level I trauma center from July 2015 to July 2020. Patients who underwent spinal surgery, defined as anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, posterior cervical spinal fusion, anterior or posterior thoracic/lumbar spinal fusion, spinal column wash out, or vertebral percutaneous fixation were included. Demographics, comorbidities, pre-injury anti-thrombotic use, operative characteristics, pre- and post-operative VTE prophylaxis use, and post-operative complications, including spinal bleeding, hematoma, and VTE were collected. Univariate analysis was performed, comparing baseline characteristics, VTE prophylaxis timing, and complications between patients who received VTE prophylaxis early (0-2 days post-operatively) or late (&ge;3 days post-operatively).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Three-hundred-sixty-one patients were included; 79 received no VTE prophylaxis, 189 received it within 2 days post-surgery (mean = 1.7 &plusmn; 0.5 days), and 93 received it 3 or more days post-surgery (mean = 4.4 &plusmn; 2.1 days). Patients in the late initiation group received enoxaparin more often than patients in the early initiation group (41.9% vs. 19%, p &lt; 0.001). Baseline characteristics, hospital course, and surgical management were similar between the groups. The rate of post-operative complications including hematoma, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism was similar between the early and late VTE prophylaxis initiation groups. Noteworthy, none of the patients in the early initiation group had post-operative bleeding (Table 1).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: VTE prophylaxis timing post-spinal surgery does not affect rate of spinal bleeding or hematoma in trauma patients.

Information regarding patient reported outcomes (PROs) following definitive laparotomy (DEF) versus DCL is scarce. We hypothesized that patients undergoing DEF would have improved PROs compared to those treated with DCL.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a secondary analysis of the DCL Trial, a pilot randomized controlled trial assessing DEF versus DCL in trauma. PROs were measured using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D) questionnaire at discharge and 6 months post-discharge (score of 1 = perfect health, 0 = death, and &lt; 0 = worse than death; minimally clinically important difference [MCID] = 0.05). Unadjusted Bayesian analysis with a neutral prior was performed to assess the posterior probability of achieving the MCID.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 39 patients enrolled, 21 were randomized to DEF and 18 to DCL. Eight patients died (7 DEF vs. 1 DCL) and were assigned a value of 0. Of those who survived, 28 completed the EQ-5D at discharge (12 DEF vs. 16 DCL) and 25 at 6 months (12 DEF vs 13 DCL). Most patients were male (79%) with a median age of 30 (IQR 21-42), suffered blunt injury (56%), and were severely injured (median injury severity score 33, IQR 21 &ndash; 42). Levels reported by each treatment group are shown in Figure 1. Median EQ-5D value at discharge was 0.20 (IQR 0.06 &ndash; 0.52) DEF vs. 0.31 (IQR -0.03 &ndash; 0.43) DCL, and at 6 months 0.51 (IQR 0.30 &ndash; 0.74) DEF vs. 0.50 (IQR 0.28 &ndash; 0.84) DCL. Differences between the two treatment groups at discharge and 6 months were similar (-0.06 (95% CI -0.28 - 0.16) and -0.06 (95% CI -0.37-0.25), respectively). The posterior probability of a MCID in EQ-5D in DEF vs. DCL at discharge and 6 months, was 16% and 23%, respectively.

Multi-omic analysis of the circulating compartment has allowed for a deeper dive into biomarker profiling of trauma patients. Speculation about the function of extracellular release of tricarboxylic citric acid (TCA) cycle metabolites in response to injury has garnered interest outside of energy metabolism. Here, we hypothesized that TCA cycle metabolites are actively released into the circulation by mechanisms not involving lytic cell death after severe injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Admission plasma samples from 80 trauma patients enrolled in the PAMPer trial were used for untargeted metabolomic (Metabolon, NC, USA) and aptamer-based proteomic (SomaLogic, CO, USA) analyses. Patients from the standard-of-care arm (mean injury severity score [ISS] = 28) were included and stratified based on 30-day survival (43 survivors and 37 nonsurvivors). Cell death and apoptosis-related proteins were identified using protein GO enrichment from a database of 7000 distinct proteins. Correlation heatmaps were created between TCA cycle metabolites and cell death proteins measured at admission to determine the relationship between metabolite release and lytic cell death.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified a massive release of TCA cycle metabolites and cell death proteins at admission following traumatic injury. An overall inverse correlation between 10 TCA cycle intermediates and 11 apoptosis-related cell death proteins was observed in both the survivor and nonsurvivor groups. The nonsurvivor group had a significantly strong negative correlation between TCA cycle metabolites and cell-death proteins (Spearman correlation coefficient between -0.62 to -0.84 with p values &lt; 0.05). When stratified by 30-day mortality, TCA metabolites and cell-death proteins showed differential relationships. Non-survivors had a stronger inverse relationship between metabolites in the initial portion of the TCA cycle and cell-death proteins, particularly in citrate, isocitrate, and tricarballylate compared to the proteins at admission. In contrast, survivors showed stronger inverse correlations (p &lt; 0.05) between cell death proteins and metabolites later in the TCA cycle including fumarate, malate, and succinate.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We showed that both proteins associated with lytic cell death and TCA cycle metabolites are released into the circulation of trauma patients immediatley after severe injury. This release is much more pronounced in patients that go on to die. However, the strong negative correlation between these two families of biomarkers suggests that the TCA metabolites are not released though mechanisms involving lytic cell death and therefore could involve active processes.

Mollen<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is spectrum of chronic and relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise mechanism of IBD has yet to be elucidated, key to this inflammatory process is the recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors (PRR). Cyclic-GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) is a recently discovered cytoplasmic PRR that senses both pathogenic and self-DNAs. cGAS has been demonstrated to promote cell death as well as autophagy, a cellular mechanism that removes dysfunctional cellular components by transporting them into double membraned vesicles for degradation. We hypothesize that cGAS plays a key role in intestinal homeostasis by maintaining the crosstalk between cell death and autophagy in IBD.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We evaluated intestinal mRNA expression and protein levels of cGAS in patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and controls (n=7/group). Subsequently, we performed a standard 7-day 2% Dextran Sulfate Sodium colitis model on cGAS KO and WT C7/B6 mice (n=12/group). We assessed the disease activity index (DAI) scores comprised of weight loss, stool consistency, and bleeding. We evaluated the tissue via qPCR, western blot analysis, H&amp;E staining, immunofluorescence (IF), and TUNEL assay. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We found significant increases in cGAS mRNA expression in children with UC (p&lt;0.01). IF and WB demonstrated increased cGAS protein in patients with UC. Our results also demonstrate cGAS KO mice to have worsened severity of colitis compared to WT mice when subjected to experimental colitis. This was demonstrated by significantly higher DAI scores (p&lt;.01), shorter colon lengths (p&lt;.01), increased pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&szlig;(p&lt;.01) and TNF-&alpha; (p&lt;.01), as well as increased gross tissue damage seen with H&amp;E staining. Co-IP demonstrated direct binding between cGAS and key autophagy initiating protein Beclin-1 in intestinal epithelial cells. We report decreased expression of Beclin-1 (p&lt;0.01), decreased autophagic flux demonstrated by decreased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (p=0.05), and increased levels of p-62 protein expression signifying disruption of autophagy in cGAS KO mice subjected to experimental colitis compared to WT mice. In our investigation of cell death via IF our data demonstrates significantly higher TUNEL staining (p&lt;.01), as well as increased cleavage of Caspase-3 in cGAS KO mice subjected to DSS when compared to WT mice subjected to DSS colitis.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: cGAS has been shown to play a key role in the defense against pathogens as well as a stimulator of autoimmune inflammation. Our data suggest that cGAS plays a key role in maintaining the intestinal epithelial homeostasis during human IBD and murine colitis by regulating a homeostatic balance between autophagy and cell death.

Salimi-Jazi<sup>1</sup>, M. Diyaolu<sup>1</sup>, J. Dunn<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Stanford University, Pediatric Surgery, Palo Alto, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Short bowel syndrome (SBS), a devastating disease with resultant nutritional deficiencies can lead to intestinal failure (IF), sepsis and death. Treatment includes costly chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with its related complications. Surgical gut-lengthening procedures are associated with high morbidity and mortality relative to benefit. We have seen significant intestinal lengthening with spring mediated distraction enterogenesis in rodent and porcine models but these studies were limited to an external plication technique. Our recent focus has been on internal plication techniques which will allow for further experimentation with less invasive methods. We hypothesize that an internal plication technique will yield significant lengthening of functional gut.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Laparotomy was performed on 7 juvenile female mini-Yucatan pigs. An enterotomy was made and a gelatin-encapsulated compressed nitinol spring was inserted into the jejunal lumen. The bowel wall just proximal and distal to the spring-containing segment was internally plicated at 50% of the luminal diameter with absorbable sutures to fix the spring. The enterotomy was repaired and control segment distal to the spring segment was marked. Pigs were placed on a liquid diet and euthanized on postoperative day (POD) 7. Spring and control segments were measured, and samples were stained with H&amp;E to evaluate histologic changes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The spring constant averaged 5.95N/m, ranging from 4.7N/m to 11.2N/m. Springs measured 7.5cm uncompressed, with a diameter of 1.0cm. 6 out of 7 pigs survived until POD7, with one euthanized on POD3 for infection at the spring segment. This pig was excluded from analysis. There was an average 153% gain (p=0.034) in spring-containing bowel length across all included pigs when comparing length of spring segment on index operation to POD7, with an average 174% relative length increase when accounting for changes in the control segment. H&amp;E staining of the spring segments on POD7 showed normal mucosal integrity when compared to control segments. Plicated portions were also histologically normal. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
SBS is a devastating sequela of many childhood diseases including NEC and Crohn&rsquo;s disease. Morbidity results from decreased functional bowel, often culminating in the need for expensive and deleterious long-term TPN. Current modalities available for gut lengthening have significant morbidity. Our work proves the concept of spring-mediated distraction enterogenesis with recent data using internal plication techniques demonstrating significant bowel lengthening. This represents a step toward the development of minimally invasive bowel lengthening techniques with significant potential for clinical application.

Esni<sup>1</sup>, G. Gittes<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Children's Hospital Of Pittsburgh Of UPMC, Pediatric Surgery, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the fourth leading cause of cancer death with a 5-year survival rate of 10%, is often diagnosed late when there are limited therapeutic options. We successfully ablated the exocrine pancreas and preserved the endocrine pancreas in monkeys and mice with chronic pancreatitis using a pancreatic intraductal infusion of 1% acetic acid (AA). We have termed this procedure a &ldquo;chemical pancreatectomy.&rdquo; We hypothesize that a chemical pancreatectomy may ablate pre-malignant lesions and PDAC. A chemical pancreatectomy may also be used prophylactically or palliatively for certain patient populations.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
To induce PDAC in mice, we implanted a matrigel suspension containing 1mg of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), a potent carcinogen, into the tail of the pancreas. PDAC developed two weeks after implantation. We performed a chemical pancreatectomy or a control infusion of normal saline (NS) two to eight weeks after implantation. Mice were then sacrificed two, four, or six weeks after infusion. In separate prophylactic experiments, mice underwent an infusion of AA or NS with subsequent implantation eight weeks after infusion. Consequently, mice were sacrificed eight weeks after implantation. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Grossly, there was no evidence of PDAC in mice after chemical pancreatectomy, regardless of whether implantation was done before or after infusion, while NS-infused mice progressed to advanced PDAC. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the gross findings. Figure 1A demonstrates a PDAC (outlined area) around the implantation site (*) after normal saline infusion. Figure 1B shows an ablated exocrine pancreas without evidence of cancer around the implantation site (*) after 1% acetic acid infusion.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Chemical pancreatectomy may be a potential therapy to ablate pre-malignant lesions, PDAC, or as a form of palliation. Furthermore, it may be a valuable prophylactic treatment for those likely to develop PDAC from chronic pancreatitis or other predisposing conditions. Lastly, this procedure may easily translate to humans via ERCP.

Concrete parameters governing the exact timing of surgical intervention for NEC and the extent of intestinal resection in the operating room frequently do not exist. There is a significant need for novel tools to assist in determining which babies might benefit from surgery and the differentiation of viable and non-viable intestine in the operating room. We have previously identified LC Resonant Sensors as reliable tools for differentiating viable from nonviable tissue in mice. In this study, we examined the use of resonant sensors as a novel approach to identify bowel ischemia.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: To determine a frequency difference between healthy and ischemic intestine ex vivo, intestine was eviscerated, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was dissected but not clamped, and resonant frequency scans were obtained every second for fifteen minutes (Sham). For the ischemia model, the SMA was clamped, and the resonant frequency of the ischemic intestine was measured as above (Fig 1A, B). To identify whether intestinal ischemia could be detected from outside the abdomen, bowel was eviscerated, the SMA was dissected, intestine was returned to the abdomen, and the skin was closed (Sham). Abdominal scans were obtained every second for fifteen minutes. For the ischemia model, the bowel was eviscerated, the SMA was clamped, the bowel was returned into the abdomen, and the abdomen was scanned as above. Data were analyzed with MATLAB, reported as a fold change &plusmn; SEM, and statistical significance was determined using Student&rsquo;s t-test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were significant differences between the resonant frequency values of ischemic intestine and healthy intestine when scanned ex vivo (Fig 1C, ischemia vs. sham, p&lt;0.00001). Representative scans are presented in Fig 1D showing transmission loss. When the intestine was returned to the abdomen, resonant frequency values of the ischemic bowel in situ were significantly lower than those of healthy bowel (Fig 1E, ischemia vs. sham, p&lt;0.00001). Representative scans of the in situ model are presented in Fig 1F indicating detectable transmission loss.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We observed significant differences in resonant frequency values of ischemic and nonischemic murine intestine. Notably, these differences were consistent between ex vivo and in situ experiments, indicating that intestinal ischemia may be detected inside and outside the abdominal cavity via a resonant sensor. These findings show promise for the use of LC Resonant Sensors in the differentiation of viable bowel tissue and more rapid identification of NEC.

Gastroschisis is an abdominal wall defect that leads to high morbidity and mortality. Thus, its perinatal management remains under substantial research. Multiple animal models of gastroschisis have been described to date using teratogenic, transgenic, and surgical techniques. However, the critical limitations of them, including the low rate of success, the concomitant malformations, the animal suffering and mortality, and the technical limitations, have made gastroschisis models unpopular and inconvenient.The aim of this research was to create an animal model of gastroschisis that overcomes the current limitations, to facilitate its experimental investigation. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Eleven time-dated pregnant rats underwent laparotomy at E17. We developed a 1-mm transuterine access under transillumination, followed by a transuterine fetal laparotomy to create an abdominal wall defect. Fetuses were harvested at term and divided into two experimental groups: gastroschisis and control. The morphometric parameters studied were the fetal body weight (FW), intestinal weight per unit length (IW), and its relation (IW/FW ratio). The thicknesses of the serosa and the muscular layers were determined through microscopic examination, as surrogates of inflammation, using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Apoptosis was assessed through immunofluorescence using Cleaved Caspase-3 (CCasp3).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

After a period of learning curve not included in this study, we achieved 22% (n=2) and 4.1% (n=1) of maternal and fetal mortality respectively. Mean surgical time was 15.7 minutes (SD 1.14). Model failure was observed in 26% of the fetuses. Mean intestinal weight/cm was significantly higher in the herniated intestine compared to control (26.65 vs. 8.37 mg/cm; p&lt;0.0001) and compared to the non-herniated intestine of gastroschisis (mean 26.65 vs. 13.2 mg/cm; p&lt;0.0001). IW/FW ratio was significantly higher in the herniated intestines compared to control (mean 0.005 vs. 0.001; p&lt;0.0001) and compared to the non-herniated intestines of gastroschisis (mean 0.005 vs. 0.002; p&lt;0.0001). The thicknesses of the serosa and muscular layers were significantly increased in the herniated intestine compared to control (mean 70.4 vs. 14.8 um, p=0.0061). CCasp3 was expressed in all gastroschisis intestinal samples but not in control.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The rat model of gastroschisis has numerous benefits for research. We describe a novel technique that minimizes the size of the hysterotomy and avoids fetal exposure, making the procedure less invasive, therefore decreasing animal mortality and suffering. The morphological changes observed in this experimental model, including the thickening serosa and muscular layers and the expression of CCasp3, resemble human gastroschisis.

We recently demonstrated that Interleukin- (IL) 10-producing type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1) decrease fibrosis in murine wounds. Tr1 are known to inhibit NLRP3 mediated production of pro-fibrotic interleukin (IL)-1b by macrophages via IL-10 signaling. However, the capacity of Tr1 cells to modulate fibrotic phenotype driven by the NLRP3 inflammasome in dermal fibroblasts is unknown. We hypothesize that IL-10 producing regulatory T lymphocytes reverse the fibrotic phenotype of myofibroblasts which have been activated by the NLRP3 inflammasome.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Adult dermal fibroblasts (AFB) and splenocytes were harvested from C57L/B6 (WT) and 10BiT mice, respectively. Splenocytes were sorted into CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg), CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>Hi</sup>Foxp3<sup>- </sup>Tr1 precursors, or CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>int/lo</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> Tnaive using fluorescence activated cell sorting and activated (anti-CD3/28 microbeads) for 6, 9, or 12 days, with phenotype and IL-10 production evaluated by flow cytometry. NLRP3 activation of AFB was performed using sequential administration of TGF-&beta; , lipopolysaccharide, and adenosine triphosphate. AFB were cultured in medium alone or with conditioned medium (CM) from 9-day-activated Tr1, Treg, or Tnaive for 24 hours and gene expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (&alpha; SMA) measured by RT-qPCR. N=3 experimental replicates. Statistics performed using ANOVA, p&lt;0.05 considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Flow cytometry evaluation revealed optimal polarization towards Tr1 (coexpression of CD49b and LAG3) following 9 days of activation (70.2% of live cells) vs 6 (41.9%) or 12 (41.7%) days of activation. Similarly, the proportion of cells staining positively for IL-10 was greatest at 9 days of activation (86.7% of live cells) compared to 6 (47.9%) or 12 (62.9%) days activation. Expression of &alpha;SMA was significantly increased in AFB by NLRP3 activating factors compared to untreated (1.9&plusmn;0.2 vs 0.9&plusmn;0.3-fold expression, p&lt;0.05) (Figure 1). &alpha;SMA expression was then significantly lowered by treatment with CM from Tr1 (0.6&plusmn;0.03-fold expression, p&lt;0.01) and Treg (0.6&plusmn;0.2-fold expression, p&lt;0.01). There was no significant decrease in aSMA expression following treatment with Tnaive CM, which produce no IL-10.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
IL-10 producing T lymphocytes attenuate the fibrotic phenotype of NLRP3 inflammasome activated AFB. Developing methods to attract T cells as anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic mediators to the wound may result in improved patient scarring outcomes.

Leiva<sup>1</sup>, C. J. Hunter<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Oklahoma College Of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Oklahoma City, OK, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe disease that predominantly affects premature neonates. We have previously shown that three dimensional organoids harvested from neonatal intestinal tissue are an innovative model for NEC. However, standard enteroid models have a basolateral-out configuration (BO). This does not provide easy access to the &ldquo;luminal&rdquo; surface. Access to the lumen (apical surface) is necessary to allow physiologically comparable evaluation of the effect of bacteria and endotoxins on the intestine. We hypothesize that an apical surface-out (AO) enteroid will provide a more biologically relevant model of NEC than BO enteroids.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Following institutional review board approval (#11610-11611), discarded intestinal tissue was collected from premature human neonates undergoing surgical resection. Intestinal stem cells were collected via crypt isolation to grow small organoids known as enteroids. Enteroids were grown to maturity in the BO conformation embedded in basement membrane matrix. After reaching maturity, enteroids were re-suspended in media alone for 72 hours prior to experimentation to induce an AO conformation. This was confirmed via immunofluorescent staining for the apical protein zonula occludens-1 and basolateral protein beta-catenin (figure 1). Enteroids (AO and BO) were then either untreated (control) or treated for 24 hours with 100ug/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) +/- 6-hour hypoxic conditions. The inflammatory cytokine TNF-&alpha; and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expression for TNF-&alpha; and the tight junction protein occludin were analyzed via qPCR.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: AO conformation was confirmed via immunofluorescence of the apical protein zonula occludens-1 and basolateral protein beta-catenin. AO and BO enteroids treated with LPS and hypoxia showed significantly increased gene expression (p=0.001 and p=0.04) and protein levels (p&lt;0.0001) of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-&alpha; compared to controls. TLR-4 protein expression was significantly increased in BO but not in AO enteroids (p=0.0026 and p=0.54). The tight junction protein occludin had significantly decreased gene expression in both BO and AO enteroids compared to control (p=0.02 and p=0.003).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Apical-out enteroids present a novel model for necrotizing enterocolitis, allowing easier access to the surface of the epithelium. Enteroids in an apical out conformation show increased inflammatory markers and decreased tight junction proteins similar to NEC. By exhibiting an apical-out conformation, this model more closely mimics in vivo NEC and may be used to elucidate potential therapeutic strategies in the management of NEC.

Rosengart<sup>1</sup>, M. Neal<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Pittsburgh, Surgery, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Exposure to differing wavelengths of light affects various physiologic processes such as immune response to sepsis and ischemia reperfusion. Previous data has suggested a role of circadian regulation in fibrinolysis and thrombosis. We hypothesized that varying light exposure prior to induction of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) would attenuate the subsequent immune cell response.

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Mice were exposed to ambient light (N =15, fluorescent white light, 400 lux), blue light (N = 15, 442 nm, 1,400 lux), and red light (N = 15, 617 nm, 1,400 lux) with a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle for 72 hours. After 72 hours of light exposure, mice were subjected to an experimental model of DVT formation that includes complete ligation of the inferior vena cava (IVC). Thrombus and blood samples were harvested for analysis. Neutrophils were isolated from mice exposed to the varying wavelengths of light and the degree of neutrophil extracellular trap activation (NETosis) was measured. Next, the supernatant of activated platelets (releasate) was isolated from the platelets of animals exposed to ambient, red, or blue light and NETosis was measured on ex vivo neutrophils after exposure to the platelet releasate.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Exposure to red light resulted in reduced clot weight compared to blue light-exposed mice (Ambient 16.5&plusmn;7.7mg, Red 4.2&plusmn;5.1mg, Blue 19.9&plusmn;8.7mg; p&lt;0.01, Fig 1A). Immunofluorescence images of thrombus revealed lower cellularity and reduced NET formation in the red-exposed thrombi (Ambient NETs per neutrophil in thrombi 0.16&plusmn;0.02, Red 0.11&plusmn;0.09, Blue 0.40&plusmn;0.08; p&lt;0.01 Red vs. Blue). Isolated neutrophils from red light-exposed mice also showed reduced NETosis ex vivo. Strikingly, platelet releasate from these animals markedly reduced neutrophil activation (Figure 1B).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Taken together, these data suggest that red light exposure results in reduced thrombus burden by attenuating NETosis in venous thrombosis. Fewer NETs are noted in the thrombus and reduced NETosis is seen in neutrophils of red light-exposed animals. Platelets in these animals show reduced activation, suggesting that the mechanism for this phenomenon may be a result of reduced platelet-neutrophil interactions.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a growth factor-rich autologous blood product that enhances tissue repair and decreases inflammation. PRP intensifies metrics of incorporation such as cellular proliferation, neovascularization, and tissue deposition in acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) through a decreased inflammatory response. What is unknown is PRP&#39;s effects on a synthetic mesh used in incisional hernia repair (IHR). Herein, we sought to study the impact of PRP on a polyester multifilament mesh in an in vivo model of IHR. We hypothesized that PRP would enhance tissue deposition and neovascularization, which could improve synthetic mesh tissue incorporation during IHR.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Whole blood was extracted from Lewis rats and PRP isolated. Using a rat model of IHR, a polyester multifilament mesh (Parietex) was implanted and activated PRP applied to the surface before closure. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 6, and 12wks. H&amp;E was used to assess tissue deposition and quantify neovascularization. To quantify the expression of genes related to tissue repair, RT-PCR of Col1, Col3, vWF, VEGF, and iNOS was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The addition of PRP increased tissue deposition in Parietex mesh at all time points. Neovascularization seen histologically was significantly greater in the PRP treated ADMs at 6 wks. This increase correlated with enhanced early tissue deposition at 6 wks. Moreover, the addition of PRP was associated with increased expression of genes associated with incorporation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: PRP enhanced early neovascularization in an in vivo hernia repair model. Enhanced neovascularization was associated with earlier and greater tissue deposition on Parietex. This suggests that PRP could be an adjunct to IHR where enhanced neovascularization and early tissue deposition are desired.

Davis<sup>1</sup>, S. J. Schwulst<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Feinberg School Of Medicine - Northwestern University, Surgery, Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients over 65 years of age suffer increased mortality and greater long-term neurocognitive morbidity compared to younger adults. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, are complicit in both. We hypothesized that microglia from aged mice would fail to return to a homeostatic state and adopt a disease-associated microglial phenotype after TBI.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Male aged (80-weeks) and young-adult (14-weeks) C57BL/6 mice underwent TBI vs. sham injury. Four months post-TBI or sham injury, brains were harvested and CD45+ cells (N=4,000 cells) were isolated via florescence-activated cell sorting. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was then used to assess the transcriptional response of microglia and infiltrating immune cells (N=4,000 cells) within the injured brain. cDNA libraries were prepared and sequened via the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3&#39; Reagent Kit and HiSeq 4000 instrument. Raw data were processed using the Cell Ranger pipeline mapped to the mm10 mouse reference genome. Seurat and Enrichr were used for downstream clustering, differential gene expression, and pathway analysis. All cell types were annotated using canonical markers and top expressed genes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Microglia from aged mice have distinct transcriptional profiles pre-injury and markedly different transcriptional responses post-TBI compared to young adulet mice. Pre-injury, aged mouse brains show decreased homeostatic microglia and increased infiltrating immune cells compared to young-adult mice (FDRs &lt; 0.001). Post-TBI, this disparity was amplified with a greater decrease in homeostatic microglia and increased infiltrating T cells in aged mouse brains as compared to young-adult mice (FDRs &lt; 0.001). Aged mouse brains had significantly more disease-associated microglia (DAM) post-TBI as compared to young-adults (FDR = 0.0012) with pathways enriched for neuron-neuron communication (p=8.62e-04). Aged mouse brains also showed significantly greater T-cell infiltration including CD4, CD8 native-like, and CD8 effector memory T cells (15%, 32%, and 40%). Most notable was a significantly greater infiltration of double-negative (DN) T cells into the injured brains of aged mice (FDR &lt; 0.001) with enriched pathways including TNF-alpha signaling (1.20e-19) and apoptosis (8.04e-10). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We hypothesized that microglia from aged mice would fail to return to a homeostatic state and adopt a disease-associated microglial phenotype after TBI. Our data confirms a striking reduction of homeostatic microglia with an increase of DAM post-TBI in aged mouse brains. Furthermore, aged mice demonstrated a markedly disproportionate inflammatory infiltrate after TBI predominated by the presence of CD8+ and DN T cells. Given recent reports of DN T cells being complicit in long-term neuroinflammation after ischemic stroke, this may be one mechanism by which advanced age portents worse clinical outcomes after TBI.

Cardenas<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Health Science Center At Houston, McGovern Medical School Department Of Surgery And Center For Translational Injury Research, Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Traumatic injury causes pronounced dysregulation of the coagulation system, with most severe trauma patients presenting in and sustaining a hypercoagulable state. As such, patients who survive their initial injuries are at elevated risk for thromboinflammatory complications, such as venous thromboembolism (VTE), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. Acquired antithrombin III (AT) deficiency has been identified as an independent risk factor for hypercoagulability and subsequently VTE. AT&rsquo;s primary physiological function is to downregulate enzymatic coagulation and attenuate vascular inflammation. AT is also the endogenous cofactor for heparin-based anticoagulation. While AT could be a therapeutic target to prevent the development of VTE, guidance for AT dosing to ensure normal clot formation in trauma patients is not well defined. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
To establish the level of AT necessary to achieve clotting dynamics comparable to normal pooled plasma (NPP), human AT was supplemented into AT immunodepleted NPP, up to 140% normal activity. Two ex-vivo studies were conducted to determine the effect of supplementation on hypercoagulable trauma patients. Admission plasma samples from 17 level 1, hypercoagulable trauma patients were supplemented to 120% AT activity. In a separate cohort, samples of 11 similar patients administered low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) were also supplemented. Clotting dynamics parameters were assessed via UV-Vis spectroscopy turbidity assay and Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT). Coagulation lag time and velocity were ascertained from the turbidity curves, whereas CAT produced peak thrombin generation (TG). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
AT deficient plasma (&lt; 60% AT) had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher velocity, TG, and lower lag time than NPP, which are associated with hypercoagulability. There was a strong inverse correlation with %AT supplementation between TG (R<sup>2</sup> &asymp; 1), slope (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98), and positive correlation with lag time (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97). While 60% AT supplementation into AT depleted plasma achieved slope and lag time comparable to NPP, 120% AT was required to achieve similar values in hypercoagulable trauma patient plasma. In patient samples, supplementation was found to significantly increase lag time and decrease slope between the baseline and supplemented pairs in both the admissions (p &lt; 0.01) and LMWH (p &lt; 0.01) cohorts. Furthermore, patients who developed VTE had significantly lower lag time on admission (p &lt; 0.01), and supplementation achieved lag times comparable to patients without VTE. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Compared with healthy donors, trauma patients present with accelerated and increased overall clot kinetics, particularly those patients who develop VTE. AT supplementation dose-dependently normalizes clot kinetics in hypercoagulable trauma patient plasma. Therapeutic administration of AT could be a feasible approach for mitigating the risk of VTE in recovering trauma patients.

Trauma and subsequent critical illness are associated with erythroid progenitor growth suppression and anemia. This erythropoietic dysfunction following trauma has been associated with persistent inflammation, increased hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization from the bone marrow, and chronic stress. However, the duration and reversibility of these postinjury bone marrow changes remain unknown. This study sought to determine whether removal of the chronic stressor could lead to improvement in erythroid transcription or reduced inflammation with reversal of erythroid progenitor growth suppression.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 9-10 weeks (N=8/group) were assigned to the following groups: na&iuml;ve, lung contusion and hemorrhagic shock (LCHS), LCHS plus daily chronic stress (CS) for 7 days followed by 7 days of routine handling to allow recovery (LCHS+CS 7/7), or LCHS plus daily CS for 14 days (LCHS+CS 14). All groups were sacrificed on day 14 and circulating erythroid progenitors (CD34+CD117+CD71+) were detected by flow cytometry and plasma was assessed with ELISA. Bone marrow erythroid progenitor (CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, CFU-E) growth was evaluated and RNA was obtained for PCR. Differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey&rsquo;s test for multiple comparisons. *p &lt; 0.05 vs. na&iuml;ve, **p &lt; 0.05 vs. LCHS+CS 14.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
LCHS+CS 7/7 demonstrated improvement in hemoglobin (Hgb), reduction in circulating erythroid progenitors, and improved erythroid progenitor growth while LCHS+CS 14 had a persistent reduction in Hgb, prolonged elevation of circulating erythroid progenitors, and suppressed erythroid colony growth (Table). Significantly increased erythropoietin levels along with significant decreases in plasma IL-6 and G-CSF were found in the LCHS+CS 7/7 group when compared to LCHS+CS 14 (IL-6: 5.1&plusmn;1.7** vs 9.2&plusmn;3.8 pg/mL; G-CSF: 4.1&plusmn;2.0 vs 7.4&plusmn;3.3* pg/mL). However, bone marrow KLF1 and LMO2 transcription remained significantly decreased in all groups (KLF1: 0.41&plusmn;0.05*, 0.45&plusmn;0.15*, 0.56&plusmn;0.25* and LMO2: 0.34&plusmn;0.17*, 0.17&plusmn;0.1*, 0.3&plusmn;0.12* presented as log2 fold change vs. na&iuml;ve).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Improvements in erythroid progenitor growth were seen after cessation of daily chronic stress which led to improvement in hemoglobin. Early improvements in erythropoiesis may be more closely linked to reduced inflammation-induced suppression rather than improved erythroid transcription. Although multiple factors influence erythropoietic dysfunction after trauma, this study suggests that this phenomenon is reversible and has the potential to quickly resolve with the cessation of stress.

Recently, we discovered that miRNA 130b-3p acts as a novel endogenous inhibitor of eCIRP to neutralize its proinflammatory effects. As miRNAs are unstable in vivo, miRNA 130b-3p was chemically modified to include three phosphorothioate bonds at the 5&rsquo; and 3&rsquo; ends and 2&rsquo;O-methyl ribose modifications throughout to improve its half-life by protection from endo and exonucleases. We hypothesize that modified miRNA 130b-3p reduces eCIRP-mediated inflammation in vitro and in a murine model of hepatic I/R.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Modified miRNA 130b-3p was synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). The interaction between modified miRNA 130b-3p biotinylated single-stranded mimic and recombinant murine (rm) CIRP was determined by surface plasmon resonance. Modified miRNA 130b-3p of various doses was co-incubated with rmCIRP (1 &mu;g/ml) for 30 min. rmCIRP with and without modified miRNA was used to stimulate RAW264.7 cells and mouse primary peritoneal macrophages for 24 h. TNF-&alpha; from supernatant was measured by ELISA in RAW264.7 cells, and TNF-&alpha; and IL-6 were measured in primary peritoneal macrophages. C57BL/6 male mice (8-12 weeks old) underwent 70% hepatic ischemia and 24 h reperfusion (I/R) and were treated with modified miRNA via retroorbital IV injection at the start of reperfusion (12.5 nmol/mouse). AST and ALT levels were measured in serum using calorimetric assays.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Biacore data showed a very high binding affinity for rmCIRP to modified miRNA 130b-3p mimic with a K<sub>D</sub> of 1.41 x 10<sup>-9 </sup>M. RAW264.7 macrophages treated with rmCIRP alone significantly increased TNF-&alpha; (Table). When 100 nM of modified miRNA alone was used, there was no increase in TNF-&alpha; levels. Modified miRNA combined with rmCIRP showed a dose-dependent decrease in TNF-&alpha; levels between 1 nM and 100 nM (p &lt; 0.05). At a dose of 100 nM, a decrease of 35% was observed. In primary peritoneal macrophages, TNF-&alpha; and IL-6 levels increased dramatically after rmCIRP treatment. Decreases of 50% and 36%, respectively, were observed with administration of 100 nM of modified miRNA. Preliminary results in a murine model of hepatic I/R show an increase in AST and ALT in vehicle mice and decreases of 45% and 34%, respectively, after modified miRNA treatment.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Modified miRNA 130b-3p acts as a novel inhibitor of eCIRP and decreases inflammation in vitro and injury markers in a murine model of hepatic I/R, implicating further studies on injury and inflammation to establish it as a novel therapeutic in the setting of hepatic I/R.

El Ayadi<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch, Surgery, Galveston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Hypertrophic scars result from an increased production of extracellular matrix by myofibroblasts, which are regulated through TGF-&beta; signaling during the wound healing process. Current treatments to prevent or treat hypertrophic scars are suboptimal. However, inhibiting the TGF-&beta; signaling pathway may be a viable mechanism for pharmacologic treatment of hypertrophic scars. Therefore, the purpose of our present work was to investigate the effects of Galunisertib, a novel small molecular inhibitor of type 1 TGF-&beta;1 receptor (TGF-&beta;R1), in a wound healing and fibrosis in vitro model.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Primary neonatal dermal fibroblasts were treated with either recombinant human TGF-&beta;1 (10 ng/mL), Galunisertib (10 &mu;M), TGF-&beta;1 and Galunisertib, or siRNA for TGF-&beta;R1 knockdown. Our control group was defined as cells that did not receive any treatment. Scratch assays were preformed to assess fibroblast migration. Cells were seeded to a six-well plate (2.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well) and were grown to 90% confluence. Two parallel scratches (~500 &mu;m width) were created per well. Digital images were acquired at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours and analyzed for scratch gap closure through TScratch software. To examine the fibrotic TGF-&beta;1 signaling cascade, protein expression of phosphorylated SMAD, &alpha;SMA, and collagen-1a was assessed at 72 hours by Western blot. Gene expression of &alpha;SMA, fibronectin expression, CTGF, collagen-1a, MMP1, decorin, and collagen-3 were assessed through qRT-PCR at 72 hours. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Scratch assay analysis indicated that primary neonatal fibroblasts treated with Galunisertib alone increased wound closure rate compared to fibroblasts treated with TGF-&beta;1 alone (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, there was no significant difference in gap closure between TGF-&beta;R1 knockdown fibroblasts and fibroblasts treated with Galunisertib or TGF-&beta;1. Protein expression of phosphorylated SMAD and &alpha;SMA were reduced in fibroblasts treated with Galunisertib compared to fibroblasts treated with TGF-&beta;1. However, there was no significant difference in protein expression of collagen-1a. Galunisertib reduced the transcript level of TGF-&beta;-induced expression of &alpha;SMA, fibronectin, CTGF, and collagen-1a. Galunisertib increased gene expression of MMP1 and decorin. There was no significant difference in gene expression of collagen-3 in fibroblasts treated with Galunisertib.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Galunisertib can reduce the fibrotic phenotype of primary neonatal dermal fibroblasts, but also increase wound closure rate in vitro. Therefore, Galunisertib may be a potential option for pharmacologic treatment of hypertrophic scars.

Current therapy for SI-ALI remains supportive, yet our laboratory has developed a class of novel nanomaterials called peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofibers which localize to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE1) on injured lung tissue. The aims of this study were to design, synthesize, and characterize therapeutic-containing targeted nanofibers as well as to investigate the release kinetics of the therapeutic molecules from these targeted nanofibers. We hypothesize that nanofibers constructed to target injured lung tissue may be assembled with therapeutic agents non-covalently, and these agents may be bioavailable over time to achieve a therapeutic effect. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A literature search for therapeutics effective at treating SI-ALI was performed, and candidates were identified for further testing. Selected therapeutics included: 1) L-alanyl-L-glutamine, an indirect IKK-&beta; inhibitor; 2) the peptide QTSVSPSKVI, which targets LFA-1 involved in neutrophil migration; and 3) the peptide ITDGEATDSG which targets ICAM-1 involved in neutrophil transmigration. Peptides and peptide amphiphiles were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis, purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and characterized using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Therapeutics were incorporated non-covalently into nanofibers at various molar ratios relative to the PA (0.25-8x) and tested at different concentrations (0.625-20mM). Nanofiber formation was assessed before and after therapeutic addition using transmission electron microscopy. Therapeutic elution from nanofibers was assessed at various time intervals through measurement of free, unbound therapeutic concentration via LC-MS. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: All PAs and peptides were synthesized with &ge;95% purity. ACE1-targeted nanofibers demonstrated high-aspect ratio fiber formation by transmission electron microscopy before addition of therapeutic, and this was unchanged after the addition of the three therapeutics across all molar ratios tested. Over 48 hours, and across all molar ratios tested, the average amounts of L-alanyl-L-glutamine, QTSVSPSKVI, and ITDGEATDSG eluted from nanofibers were 65.5%, 75.4%, and 67.4% of the original amount incorporated, respectively.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have successfully synthesized and characterized multiple therapeutic-containing ACE1-targeted nanofibers. Our work demonstrates that various molecules may be non-covalently incorporated into our targeted nanofiber delivery platform and subsequently elute from these nanofibers over time. Further work will include additional characterization of function, localization studies, and assessment of efficacy using our established in vivo animal model.

However, organ-specific biomarkers for tissue injury are limited in clinical panels. We used a quantitative screen of 7000 circulating proteins in severely injured humans to identify the organ-specific biomarkers that are most closely associated with patient outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Citrated plasma samples (time 0-, 24-, and 72-hrs after arrival to trauma center) from traumatically injured patients enrolled in two trials: the Prehospital Air Medical Plasma (PAMPer) and the Study of Tranexamic Acid During Air and Ground Medical Prehospital Transport (STAAMP), were subjected to multiplexed proteomic analysis (adaptamer-based, 7K platform; SomaLogic Inc.). Patients were categorized based on outcome: Early Non-Survivors (died &le;72 hrs, PAMPer; ENS), Non-Resolvers (died ?72 hrs or required &ge;7 days of critical care, PAMPer; NR), Resolvers (survived to 30-days and required ?7 days of critical care, PAMPer; R), and low Injury Severity Score (ISS) controls (placebo, STAAMP). Established organ-specific biomarkers were identified through literature review and were cross-referenced with tissue-specific proteomes and transcriptomes from the Human Protein Atlas. Proteins with tissue-specific enrichment (&ge; 4X expression compared to any other tissue) or elevation (&ge; 4X expression compared to average of all other tissues) in respective organs were analyzed. Heatmaps visualized and Kruskal-Wallis test assessed differences in protein expression across outcome groups (level of significance; P &lt;0.01).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 180 patients, 38 were ENS (median ISS=29), 78 NR (median ISS=30), 34 R (median ISS=22), and 30 low ISS controls (median ISS=1). 90 organ-specific proteins were identified on literature review of which 19 were enriched and 26 were elevated in corresponding tissue groups. Of these, 20 were significantly associated with outcome (6 cardiac, 4 liver, 6 neurologic, 1 pulmonary, and 3 renal). Visualization of these 20 organ-specific proteins identified an acute-phase response at time 0-hrs among ENS and NR which was not observed in R and low ISS controls. Interestingly, this acute-phase response resolved by 24- and 72-hrs (Figure). However, at 72-hrs, 6/20 (2 cardiac, 2 liver, and 2 neurologic) proteins remained significantly elevated in NR compared to R.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We identified an immediate release of biomarkers specific to multiple organs that are associated with patient outcomes following traumatic injury. Biomarkers for cardiac, liver, and neurologic injury remained elevated in patients that resolve slowly after severe injury. Thus, comprehensive plasma proteomic profiling can be used to identify novel organ injury biomarkers.

We hypothesized that major differences in the host response to injury would be evident in the systemic response as measured by the composition of circulating biomolecules. To test this hypothesis we applied multi-platform, multi-omics to blood plasma sampled from aged and young trauma patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Plasma samples drawn at admission from aged (&gt;65 yo) and young (18-35 yo) polytrauma patients (representative subsets from the PAMPer trial, NEJM 2018) were subjected to untargeted metabolomics (Metabolon: 889 metabolites), targeted lipidomics (Metabolon: 998 lipid species), and untargeted proteomics (Somalogic: 7000 proteins). 53 patients were represented in all three platforms including 26 young [mean Injury Severity Score (ISS)=25.0] and 27 aged (mean ISS=22.1, p=0.733). Heatmaps with K-means clustering and super-pathway identification were created. A LASSO feature selection model with subsequent permutation testing was used for both groups to derive a limited list of biomolecules with high predictive value for 30-day survival from the overall list of 8895 features. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Aged patients demonstrated a different pattern of biomolecule expression from young patients, with variations most prominent in the lipid super pathway (Figure 1a,b). Targeted analysis of lipid mediators stratified by age and ISS revealed more prominent differences between aged and young patients at moderate and severe ISS (Figure 1c). Triacylglycerol lipids were those most frequently elevated in aged patients. Modeling yielded 19 molecules (15 proteins, 1 lipid, and 3 metabolites) with high predictive value for differentiating surviving and non-surviving aged patients (mean cross validation accuracy of 91.3%). Modeling in young patients yielded 44 molecules (27 proteins, 1 lipid, 16 metabolites) with high predictive value for survival (mean cross validation accuracy of 91.7%). Notably, no overlapping features were identified between aged and young predictive models.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have identified previously undescribed variations in the systemic multi-omic response to traumatic injury in aged patients when compared to young patients, with the most notable signal in that of lipid molecules at moderate and severe ISS. Furthermore, age alters the profile of biomolecules associated with 30-day survival. These findings provide novel insight into the biologic mediators that may contribute to the varied host response and poor clinical outcomes observed in aged patients.

Glotzbach<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Utah, Division Of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Salt Lake City, UT, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Utah, Division Of General Surgery, Salt Lake City, UT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: While it is known that presence of a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection, which is broadly defined as aortopathy, genomic mechanisms and natural history are still unclear. Familial clustering has been identified, but specific genetic drivers of BAV-aortopathy have yet to be found. Many genetic variants have been identified in non-syndromic and syndromic aortopathies, such as Marfan syndrome, but none have been attributed specifically to BAV-aortopathy. In addition, the tissue level transcriptional aberrations associated with BAV-aortopathy have not been elucidated. This study was designed to identify differences in gene expression between thoracic aortic aneurysm tissue isolated from patients with BAV and patients with normal aortic valves. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We collected aneurysmal aortic tissue from patients undergoing surgical aortic repair at our institution. We performed a case cohort pilot analysis of aortic tissue gene expression in BAV and tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) aneurysm repairs, with TAV serving as control. Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis was performed to determine differential gene expression between BAV aneurysm tissue (n=4) and TAV aneurysm tissue (n=3). Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the DAVID Knowledgebase to identify altered biological processes and pathways. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Differential gene expression analysis yielded 18 upregulated genes and 42 downregulated genes in BAV tissue relative to TAV at adjusted p-value &lt;0.05. Gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated that these genes participate in cell differentiation (p&lt;0.024), cell adhesion (p&lt;0.024), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) activity (p&lt;0.04). Cell differentiation genes, including INHBA (p&lt;0.029), RXFP1 (p&lt;0.014), ARHGAP24 (p&lt;0.001), and PGF (p&lt;0.001), were found to be downregulated in BAV aneurysm tissue, while ALDH1L1 (p&lt;0.015), an NAD activity gene, was found to be upregulated compared to TAV aneurysm tissue. Cell adhesion genes CD24 (p&lt;0.015) and CNTN1 (p&lt;0.001) were upregulated, but POSTN was downregulated (p&lt;0.040) in BAV aneurysm tissue compared to TAV aneurysm tissue.

Cohen<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, Department Of Surgery, Aurora, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Severely injured trauma patients develop a dysregulated inflammatory state characterized by endothelial permeability which contributes to multiple organ failure and infection. To date, however, the mediators of and mechanisms for this permeability are not well established. Endothelial permeability in other inflammatory states such as sepsis is driven primarily by overactivation of the RhoA GTPase. We hypothesized that endothelial permeability after trauma positively correlates with level of shock and injury and is driven by increased RhoA pathway activation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were grown to confluence while continuous resistance was measured using ECIS Z-theta technology, 10% ex vivo plasma from severely injured trauma patients was added, and resistance measurements continued for 2 hours. Areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated from resistance curves. For GTPase activity analysis, HUVECs were grown to confluence and incubated with 10% trauma plasma for 5 minutes prior to harvesting of cell lysates. Rho and Rac activity were determined using a G-LISA assay. Significance was determined using Mann-Whitney tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman r was calculated for correlations.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Plasma from severely injured trauma patients induces endothelial permeability with plasma from patients in shock contributing most to this increased permeability (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, injury severity (ISS) does not correlate with in vitro trauma-induced permeability (-0.05, p&gt;0.05) while Base excess (BE) does correlate with permeability (-.47, p= 0.0001). The combined impact of shock and injury resulted in a significantly smaller AUC in the injury+shock group (ISS&gt;15, BE&lt;-9) compared to the injury only (ISS&gt;15, BE&gt;-9 (p=0.04)) or minimally injured (ISS&lt;15, BE&gt;-9 (p=0.005)) groups (figure 1B). Additionally, incubation with injury+shock plasma resulted in higher RhoA activation (p=0.002) and a trend toward decreased Rac1 activation (p=.07) compared to minimally injured control (Figure 1C).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Over the past decade, improved early survival in patients with severe trauma and hemorrhagic shock has led to a renewed focus on the Endotheliopathy of Trauma. This study presents the largest study to date measuring endothelial permeability in vitro using plasma collected from patients after traumatic injury. Here, we show that shock drives endothelial permeability after trauma through increased RhoA activation. Our ECIS model of trauma-induced permeability using ex vivo plasma has potential as a high throughput screening tool to phenotype endothelial dysfunction, study mediators of trauma-induced permeability, and screen potential interventions.

While REBOA should enhance coronary perfusion, there is a risk of secondary brain injury due to loss of cerebral autoregulation. We developed a combat casualty relevant DCBI swine model to evaluate the effects of Zone 1 REBOA on intracranial pressure and cerebral edema. We hypothesized that Zone 1 REBOA after DCBI increases mean arterial pressure (MAP) but also increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and promotes secondary brain injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 50kg male Yorkshire swine were subjected to a combination DCBI model consisting of blast TBI (50psi, ARA Mobile Shock Laboratory), tissue injury (bilateral femur fractures), hemorrhagic shock (controlled bleeding to a base deficit of 10mEq/l). During the shock phase, pigs were randomized to observation only (control group, n=8), or to 30 minutes of Zone 1 REBOA (REBOA group, n=4). After shock, pigs in both groups received Tactical Combat Casualty Care-based resuscitation and were monitored for an additional 240 minutes until euthanasia/death for a total 6-hour study. ICP was monitored throughout the model, and brains were harvested for water content at conclusion. Linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to compare MAP and ICP between REBOA and control groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Following DCBI, the REBOA group had a significantly higher MAP during hemorrhagic shock compared to control (38.8mmgHg vs 16mmHg, p=.004). During balloon occlusion, ICPs were not significantly elevated in the REBOA group vs control, and ICP was significantly lower in the REBOA group at the end of the observation period. In addition, the REBOA group did not have increased brain water content (3.63g water/dry tissue vs 3.50g water/dry tissue, p=0.5, &lt;5% difference). Troponin levels were not different between the groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Zone I REBOA in a large animal DCBI model improved proximal MAPs while not significantly increasing ICP during balloon inflation. Observation up to 4 hours post-resuscitation did not show clinical signs of secondary brain or cardiac injury. These data suggest that in a complex DCBI swine model Zone 1 REBOA provides neuroprotection without cardiac stress.

This may have implications for resuscitation. We characterized the anatomy and physiology of the mesenteric circulation to understand the response to hemorrhage and resuscitation.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Five anesthetized male Yorkshire swine (50-70kg) had instrumentation of the mesenteric circulation. Flow probes and intravascular pressure catheters were placed around and within the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and inferior vena cava (IVC). Arteriograms and venograms were performed for anatomical characterization. A laser doppler flow (LDF) probe was placed on the intestine to measure end-organ perfusion with data normalized to baseline values. Baseline data was collected for 60 min, followed by a pressure-controlled exsanguination to a SBP of 50 mmHg for 60 mins. Animals were then resuscitated with shed blood and intravenous fluids for 120 min in a critical care setting. Flow (mL/min), pressure (mmHg) and perfusion (P) data was collected continuously. Lactate levels (mmol/L) were measured at the mid- and endpoint intervals of each stage. Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to compare hemodynamics during baseline vs shock and baseline vs resuscitation.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: After hemorrhagic shock, lactate increased to a median lactate of 5.8 &plusmn; 2.5. Pressures and flows decreased during hemorrhagic shock but returned to baseline following resuscitation: SMA (70 vs 36 vs 75, p &lt; 0.001; 787 vs 371vs 792, p &lt; 0.001), SMV (9 vs 8 vs 10, p &lt; 0.001; 186 vs 52 vs 141, p &lt; 0.001), IVC (12 vs 7 vs 10, p &lt; 0.001; 174 vs 27 vs 189, p &lt; 0.001), and MAP (67 vs 36 vs 69, p &lt; 0.001). LDF fell during hemorrhage (1.38 vs 0.38 P, p &lt; 0.001) but did not return to baseline during resuscitation (0.70 P, p &lt; 0.001). The intestine achieved only 51% of baseline perfusion after resuscitation despite return of mesenteric vasculature pressures and flows. The mesenteric anatomy was qualitatively comparable to humans with the primary difference being smaller posterior mesentery vessels in place of inferior mesentery vessels.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: End organ perfusion did not adequately recover after controlled hemorrhage with resuscitation to baseline hemodynamics in a swine model. Continuous physiologic insult is likely occurring despite resuscitation. Mesenteric perfusion may represent an important endpoint of resuscitation after hemorrhage.

Trauma persists as the leading cause of mortality for those age 1 to 44 years old. The endotheliopathy of trauma (EoT), defined by elevated plasma syndecan-1 concentration, is associated with increased mortality following injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms and clinical implications of EoT have yet to be fully elucidated. We have evaluated the plasma proteome related to EoT in order to provide insight into the role of the endothelium within the systemic response to trauma.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Plasma samples were collected upon emergency department arrival for 100 patients requiring the highest level of trauma activation between March 2012 and February 2018. 99 subjects had suitable plasma samples for analysis. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of syndecan-1, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), epinephrine and norepinephrine was performed, as well as untargeted proteome quantification utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (MS). EoT was defined by plasma syndecan-1 concentration &ge;40 ng/mL. Clinical and ELISA data between EoT and non-EoT groups was examined with a Welch t-test, Fisher exact test or Pearson chi-squared test. Further comparison using untargeted proteins identified by MS was completed with a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value and elastic-net regularized logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
62 trauma patients qualified as EoT and 37 were non-EoT. The EoT group was associated with increased injury severity, increased metabolic derangement and a hypocoaguable thromboelastography profile compared to non-EoT patients (p &lt;0.05). Plasma catecholamine and sTM concentrations were elevated in the EoT group (p &lt;0.05). 52 out of 290 proteins identified by MS were differentially expressed between the EoT and non-EoT subjects (FDR adjusted p &lt;0.05). This included 39 upregulated and 13 downregulated proteins associated with EoT. These proteins are involved in endothelial activation, coagulation, inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis, and include known damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Increased plasma concentrations of intracellular proteins preferentially expressed in tissues including the liver, kidneys and heart were associated with EoT. Among 42 proteins that best discriminate EoT from non-EoT subjects selected by elastic-net regularized logistic regression, the ten strongest predictors of EoT included ACTC1, C4A, GSTA1, S100A9, ADH1B, HIST1H4A, ACTBL2, SERPINF2, CFH and ITIH1.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this observational study we present a unique proteomic signature associated with EoT including 52 differentially expressed proteins involved in a variety of relevant molecular and physiological processes. We report an association between EoT, metabolic derangement, elevated plasma levels of DAMPs and circulating intracellular proteins suggestive of end-organ damage. These findings may reflect tissue hypoperfusion and support the utility of EoT as an index of cellular injury.

Sam Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death in military and civilian populations, with more than 60% of mortalities occurring early after injury in the pre-hospital setting. Current hemorrhage resuscitation guidelines utilize invasive and non-invasive (NI) measurements including blood pressure and heart rate (HR), but cannot predict massive transfusion (MT) need and the point at which intervention is necessary to prevent cardiovascular decompensation (Decomp). However NI regional tissue oxygenation (rSO<sub>2</sub>) has shown promise for predicting MT need in trauma patients. We hypothesized cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub> would indicate the need for MT in non-human primate models of hemorrhagic shock.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Male Rhesus Macaques were anesthetized and shock was induced in a volume targeted (VT, n=5) or pressure targeted (PT, n=14) manner. VT animals were monitored for 30 minutes (min) following 30% estimated blood volume hemorrhage. PT animals were hemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 20mmHg and maintained between 20-24mmHg via ad libitum bleeding for at least 60min until Decomp, defined as inability to maintain &gt;75% mean MAP from the first 60min. Animals in both groups were monitored for MAP, HR, end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) and cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub>. Statistics at time points were analyzed via one- or two-way repeated measures ANOVA, correlations determined via Pearson&rsquo;s R, significance: p&lt;0.05.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Following initial hemorrhage (S0), no significant differences were observed between groups in MAP, HR, EtCO<sub>2</sub>, rSO<sub>2</sub> or shed blood volume (SBV). After cessation of hemorrhage in VT animals, MAP and EtCO<sub>2</sub> returned to baseline (BSLN) levels while rSO<sub>2</sub> plateaued. Comparatively, ad libitum hemorrhage in the PT group maintained the model-defined low MAP, thereby suppressing EtCO<sub>2</sub>, and significantly decreased rSO<sub>2</sub> levels compared to VT by S25. For PT animals, while all monitored vitals were significantly different from BSLN by Decomp, only rSO<sub>2</sub> became significantly decreased from S0 by S60, prior to MAP defined Decomp. Linear regression of rSO<sub>2</sub> vs MAP and rSO<sub>2</sub> vs SBV at BSLN, S0 and final time in shock (S30 for VT, Decomp for PT) demonstrated R<sup>2</sup>=0.5107 and R<sup>2</sup>=0.7539, respectively.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Regardless of hemorrhage modality and compensatory response, cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub> correlated more strongly with SBV and demonstrated a sensitivity for changes from BSLN vitals more than MAP and other markers of shock severity. Utilizing the line of best fit from rSO<sub>2</sub> vs SBV, rSO<sub>2</sub> values below 49% would indicate Class 4 Shock (blood loss &gt;40%) per ATLS guidelines. Taken together, non-invasive cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub> at the point of care may help indicate the need for MT or other intervention earlier and more accurately than traditional markers.

Airway edema and parenchymal injury lead to poor oxygen delivery and ventilation. The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying parenchymal inflammation and injury remain poorly understood. Here we developed a swine model of smoke inhalation injury to further elucidate the activation of early inflammatory pathways.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A custom-made smoke generator was employed to deliver smoke via an endotracheal tube to Yorkshire swine. Carboxyhemoglobin levels were then titrated to a level of &gt; 50%. Sham animals received the same procedures (intubation, anesthesia, and vascular access) but were not exposed to smoke. Necropsies were performed immediately after completion of the experiment and lung samples were collected and stored in formalin or flash frozen for molecular analysis. Histologic analysis was performed after H&amp;E staining. A validated, published, scoring system composed of 5 parameters (neutrophils in the alveolar space, neutrophils in the interstitial space, hyaline membrane formation, protein detritus in the alveolar space and septum thickening) was used to assess lung injury severity. RNA was then isolated and PCR analysis was carried out using an 84 gene cytokine and chemokine array (Qiagen).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: As expected, histologic examination revealed a higher lung injury severity compared to control pigs and this was statistically significant (0.2 vs. 0.6, p&lt;.01). There was differential gene expression between the experimental and sham groups. Significant upregulation of 10 genes was measured in the injured lungs (ADIPOQ, AMCF-II, CCL19, CCL8, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL16, CNTF, CXCL13, SPP1). There was also persistence of 11 downregulated genes (BMP3, BMP6, CCL21, CCL28, CXCL11, CXCL9, IFNG, IL15, CCL23, CCL24, TGFB2) throughout all animals when compared to controls. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Smoke inhalation injury leads to poor clinical outcomes and there are currently limited treatment options. This work demonstrates early differential gene expression of inflammatory targets in lung parenchyma. Further understanding of these pathways and their regulation may lead to better understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the host response to inhalation injury and aid in development of early, targeted therapies.

Intimal hyperplasia (IH) in response to vascular injury has remained a common problem, such as in vein graft surgery. In recent years, few genomic studies have shed light on the transcriptomic mechanisms of IH or potential genetic targets for therapy. Here, we compared transcriptomic profiles from three studies on vascular injury using a systems biology approach to identify genetic targets for prevention and treatment of IH.

Genes identified by IPA were analyzed for changes in gene expression between experimental (exposed to vascular injury) versus control (no vascular injury) conditions using t-tests, and genes with significant changes in transcriptomic activity in response to injury across multiple studies were identified. Analyses were performed sequentially (Fig 1).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The sequential analyses identified 113 dysregulated genes between experimental and control samples in one or more of the three studies.

For in vitro experiments, human skeletal muscle cells (hSkMC) were transduced with E-selectin/lentivirus or GFP/lentivirus as control. Following transduction, 5x10<sup>4</sup> E-selectin<sup>+</sup>-hSkMC and GFP<sup>+</sup>-hSkMC were seeded in 6-well plates and proliferation was assessed by cell counting. Transgene expression was confirmed by flow cytometry and ATP content was measured after lysis of 1x10<sup>6</sup> untransduced hSkMC, E-selectin<sup>+</sup>-hSkMC, and GFP<sup>+</sup>-hSkMC.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Following induction of ischemia, recovery of hindlimb perfusion was significantly improved in mice treated with E-selectin/AAV2/2 (POD 7: 0.37&plusmn;0.07, POD 14: 0.46&plusmn;0.08, POD 21: 0.55&plusmn;0.13) compared to LacZ/AAV2/2 (POD 7: 0.28&plusmn;0.06, POD 14: 0.33&plusmn;0.05, POD 21: 0.30&plusmn;0.10) (p=0.008 on POD 7, p&lt;0.001 on POD 14, p&lt;0.001 on POD 21). Mean grip strength was similar between the groups preoperatively; however, by POD 14 and through POD 21, mice treated with E-selectin/AAV2/2 demonstrated improved grip strength (POD 14: 2.19&plusmn;0.29 gf/g, POD 21: 2.38&plusmn;0.35 gf/g) compared to LacZ/AAV2/2 controls (POD 14: 1.87&plusmn;0.31 gf/g, POD 21: 2.01&plusmn;0.42 gf/g) (p=0.03 on POD 14 and p=0.04 on POD 21). During treadmill exhaustion testing on POD 7, mice treated with E-selectin/AAV2/2 ran a significantly greater distance (264&plusmn;75 m) than LacZ/AAV2/2 controls (180&plusmn;69 m) (p=0.03). In vitro, cell counting showed enhanced proliferation of E-selectin<sup>+</sup>-hSkMC (18.3&plusmn;3.3x10<sup>4</sup> cells) by Day 7 compared to GFP<sup>+</sup>-hSkMC (11.8&plusmn;1.5x10<sup>4 </sup>cells) (p=0.02). After lysis of 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells, we also found significantly increased ATP content in E-selectin<sup>+</sup>-hSkMC (1.48&plusmn;0.03 nmol) compared to GFP<sup>+</sup>-hSkMC (1.33&plusmn;0.04 nmol, p=0.003) and untransduced hSkMC (1.26&plusmn;0.04 nmol, p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In a murine hindlimb ischemia model, E-selectin/AAV2/2 gene therapy significantly improves recovery of hindlimb perfusion and function as measured by grip strength and treadmill exhaustion testing. Consistently, overexpression of E-selectin in hSkMC increases both cellular proliferation and ATP content, suggesting a possible novel role for E-selectin in skeletal muscle function

Synthetic vascular grafts used for bypass surgery experience high rates of graft failure, with previous studies showing 28% primary patency at 10-year follow-up for ePTFE and Dacron femoropopliteal grafts. The host foreign body inflammatory response may contribute to intimal hyperplasia (IH) formation at the outflow anastomosis and to delayed graft failure. Thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) regulates matrix metalloproteinases and is known to stimulate the M1 macrophage transformation in the inflammatory response. Herein, we use a bioengineered hydrogel (ClickGel) to coat vascular graft materials (ePTFE and Dacron) implanted into rat dermis to determine TSP2 gene expression response.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
1 cm incisions were made in the dorsum of 8 rats to create 4 subcutaneous pockets. 1 pocket was left as a sham; 1 pocket was implanted with a 1cm<sup>2</sup> vascular graft (4 rats with ePTFE and 4 with Dacron); 1 pocket was implanted with vascular graft + ClickGel coating; and 1 pocket was implanted with vascular graft + ClickGel coating loaded with anti-TSP2 siRNA. ClickGel consists of 5% (w/v) modified gelatin which crosslinks via a tetrazene and norbornene reaction. Rats were euthanized after 1 day, and the dermis containing the subcutaneous implants was harvested. TSP2 gene expression was determined using qRT-PCR, normalized to housekeeping gene expression determined by the BestKeeper software.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Results are summarized in Figure 1. Error bars denote standard deviation. Addition of ClickGel coating to vascular graft material, with and without anti-TSP2 siRNA, led to a decrease in TSP2 fold change expression in the surrounding dermis compared to sham group with no implant (0.424&plusmn;0.523 vs 1.310&plusmn;0.750, p=0.022; 0.536&plusmn;0.493 vs 1.310&plusmn;0.750, p=0.037, respectively). There was no difference in TSP2 gene expression between ePTFE or Dacron implants or between ClickGel with and without anti-TSP2 siRNA.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
ClickGel coating around vascular grafts decreases TSP2 expression in the surrounding dermis at 24 hours following injury, suggesting decreased inflammatory response to the gelatin-based coating. Anti-TSP2 siRNA did not result in additional decrease in TSP2 expression at this time point. There was no difference between Dacron and PTFE in the tissue inflammatory response as measured in this study.

Real time testing of endothelial function is the gold standard manner of testing arterial physiology. However, this testing is not only time consuming, but also difficult to arrange immediate availability. This is particularly true for human arterial tissue, which comes from the operating room. In preparation for establishing a protocol for delayed testing of human arteries, the objective of this study was to test various arterial preservation buffers and storage temperature on endothelial cell (EC) function. Here, we test EC function from healthy murine arteries. 

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Descending thoracic aortas were obtained from 10&ndash;12-week-old male and female C57/Bl6J mice and were either immediately tested or stored in the following buffer conditions: Opti-MEM at 37&deg;C, Opti-MEM at 4&deg;C, Krebs-HEPES with 1.8 mM calcium at 4&deg;C, Krebs-HEPES with 2.5 mM calcium at 4&deg;C, or University of Wisconsin (UW) at 4&deg;C. EC function was tested by isometric force testing (20 mN resting tension) or stored for 24 hours. All arteries were then placed in Krebs-PSS buffer at 37&deg;C and subjected to isometric force testing as above. Receptor-independent contraction was measured using potassium chloride (KCl; 0 to 80 mM) and receptor-dependent contraction was measured using phenylephrine (PE; 1 nM to 30 mM). Endothelium-dependent relaxation was measured by precontracting with phenylephrine (1 mM) followed by cumulative addition of methacholine (1 nM to 10 mM). Endothelium-independent relaxation was measured by precontracting with phenylephrine (1 mM) followed by cumulative addition of sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 1 nM to 10 mM). Because all data fit within normal distribution, intergroup comparisons were statistically analyzed using repeated measure one-way of variance. p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

None of the buffers tested impacted contractile agonist sensitivity (EC<sub>50</sub>) to KCl or PE relative to the fresh vessels. UW buffer and Opti-MEM at 37&deg;C preserved the force of contraction generated by the vessels (p &gt; 0.999) whereas the force generated by vessels stored in Krebs-HEPES or Opti-MEM at 4&deg;C was significantly decreased to KCl (p &lt; 0.05) but not PE (p &gt; 0.05). UW buffer and Opti-MEM at 37&deg;C preserved endothelium-dependent relaxation (p &gt; 0.95) while Krebs-HEPES or Opti-MEM at 4&deg;C significantly affected endothelium-dependent relaxation (p &lt; 0.01). Endothelium-independent relaxation to SNP was not significantly impacted by storage buffer (p &gt; 0.15).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

UW buffer best preserves contraction and relaxation of murine aortas after 24 hours of storage. Opti-MEM stored at 37&deg;C for 24 hours also preserves vascular function if transfection is required. Future experiments will compare storage conditions in both diseased and healthy human tibial arteries.

Kibbe<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill, School Of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common aortic pathology and is associated with significant mortality. A common method of studying AAA in animal models is the application of calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) to the aorta. After CaCl<sub>2</sub> application there is fragmentation of the medial elastin, increased levels of matrix metalloproteinases, and aortic dilation. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a protein involved in the transport of lipids, and when absent, leads to the development of atherosclerosis. The aim of our study was to identify the role of ApoE in CaCl<sub>2</sub>-induced AAA. We hypothesize that ApoE-/- rats will develop worse inflammatory AAA compared to wild-type (WT) rats.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: ApoE-/- was achieved through CRISPR gene deletion in Lean Zucker (LZ) rats. Male and female ApoE-/- and WT rats underwent AAA induction by exposing the abdominal aorta to a surgical sponge soaked in CaCl<sub>2</sub> (n=5-6/treatment group). Ultrasound measurements of the abdominal aorta were performed at baseline, 14, 21, and 28 days. Rats were sacrificed at 35 days. Aortic diameters were reported as a ratio compared to their mean value at baseline with controls set to 1 for each sex. Aortas were stained for macrophages using an anti-CD68 antibody and quantified using Image J. Aortic sections were stained with Von Kossa to identify calcium deposition and Oil Red O for lipid deposition. Aortic perimeter length damage was measured using Image J. Statistical significance was calculated with a two-sample t test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In both male and female ApoE-/- rats there was a more rapid growth of AAA compared to WT rats, with both sexes reaching 20% expansion at only 14 days whereas WT rats reached 20% expansion at 21 days. Male ApoE-/- rats developed significantly larger AAA at 28 days compared to WT rats (1.39&plusmn;0.02 vs. 1.32&plusmn;0.02, P&lt;0.05). Female ApoE-/- rats developed larger AAA compared to WT rats but this did not reach significance (1.34&plusmn;0.04 vs. 1.28&plusmn;0.02, P=0.11). Macrophage staining revealed that CD68 expression was significantly higher in ApoE-/- compared to WT rats in both female (341.1&plusmn;144.1 vs. 64.7&plusmn;14.5, P&lt;0.05) and male (374.2&plusmn;152.3 vs. 43.5&plusmn;10.3, P&lt;0.05) rats. Aortas stained for calcium deposition and lipid accumulation revealed that it was present in the intima of ApoE-/- but not WT rats. Lastly, measurements of aortic wall damage revealed that among females, ApoE-/- had a larger percent of perimeter damage compare to WT rats (72% vs. 56%, P&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: ApoE-/- resulted in a more rapid initial growth and larger overall AAA in both sexes. In addition, the loss of ApoE resulted in increased inflammatory cell infiltrate and more calcium and lipid deposition. These data suggest that ApoE may be intimately involved in regulating the pathophysiologic events that result in AAA formation. Future studies will explore mechanistic associations as ApoE could represent a therapeutic target to prevent AAA formation.

Gallagher<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan, Vascular Surgery, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The purpose of this project is to establish if the histone methyltransferase, SETDB2, regulates AAA development. We hypothesize that during AAA development SETDB2 is upregulated resulting in the &ldquo;turning off&rdquo; of genes that are normally protective against pathological vascular remodeling via trimethylation of lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9me3) at gene promoters. Specifically, during normal aortic wall existence there is a balance between matrix matalloproteinases (MMPs) that function to break down the aortic wall and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which prevent the actions of MMPs on the aortic wall. During AAA development an imbalance of MMPs/TIMPs favors MMP activity. We hypothesize that this imbalance results from Setdb2 &ldquo;turning off&rdquo; TIMP gene expression in macrophages (M?s), causing MMPs to proceed unregulated thereby leading to destruction in the aortic wall.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: C57BL/6 Setdb2<sup>f/f</sup>Lyz<sup>Cre+</sup> mice, which have macrophages deficient in SETDB2, underwent the angiotensin-II infusion murine model of AAA and were compared to littermate controls with intact SETDB2 expression (C57BL/6 WT). Aneurysm size was measured with ultrasound after 28 days of angiotensin-II infusion. In vivo M?s were then isolated and analyzed for activity of SETDB2 at the gene promoter sites for TIMPs 1,2,3 and 4 using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Further, Setdb2<sup>f/f</sup>Lyz<sup>Cre+</sup> mice and littermate control mice underwent elastase model of AAA and after 14 days, frozen abdominal aorta sections (10 micron) were analyzed for MMP activity via in situ zymography with fluorescein-tagged gelatin.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Setdb2<sup>f/f</sup>Lyz<sup>Cre+</sup> mice were found to have a significant reduction in AAA formation compared to wild-type littermates. Furthermore, repressive H3K9me3 at the gene promoters of TIMP1,2,3, and 4 was significantly reduced in in vivo M?s isolated from Setdb2<sup>f/f</sup>Lyz<sup>Cre+</sup> mice. Lastly, in situ zymography showed decreased MMP activity in Setdb2<sup>f/f</sup>Lyz<sup>Cre+</sup> mice compared to littermate controls (Fig 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Taken together, these results suggest that SETDB2 regulates AAA formation via epigenetic repression of TIMP activity in macrophages, leading to an imbalance of MMP/TIMP activity and destruction of the aortic wall.

Gallagher<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Non-healing wounds in patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) are a major cause of increasing morbidity and mortality. We and others have shown that a prolonged pro-inflammatory state is typical of pathologic diabetic wound healing. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a subset of CD4+ cells that are known to be critical for physiologic wound healing and transitioning the wound microenvironment to a reparative state from an initial inflammatory state. Given that Notch signaling is known to regulate T cell phenotype in a context-dependent manner in other settings, we hypothesized that it regulates T cell phenotype in wound healing, and that decreased activation of Notch signaling in diabetic wounds leads to decreased Treg phenotype and subsequent pathologic inflammation.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Human single cell transcriptional profiling of diabetic wounds versus control wounds was obtained from amputated specimens (n=3/group) and analyzed for presence of Tregs. Next, using a murine wound healing model (4mm punch biopsy), wound T cell phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry from C57BL/6 diet-induced obese (DIO) mice (a model of T2D) at day 3, 5, and 7 post-wounding (n=5/group). Wound CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells were isolated using magnetic cell sorting and analyzed for Notch signaling expression via quantitative PCR (qPCR). C57BL/6 mice with CD4<sup>+</sup>-specific deficiency in Notch signaling (DNMAML-CD4<sup>cre+</sup>) were wounded and compared to control (cre-) littermates (n=5/group) for wound healing via daily photo analysis and presence of Tregs via flow cytometry. Wound healing curves were analyzed using Image J software. Statistical significance was determined using Student&rsquo;s t-test.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Human single cell transcriptional profiling of diabetic wounds versus control wounds revealed decreased Tregs in diabetic wounds. Diabetic mice had less wound Tregs (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXp3<sup>+</sup>) compared to nondiabetic control mice, and decreased expression of Notch target genes Hey1 and Hes1, indicating decreased Notch signaling. Similarly, DIO DNMAML-CD4<sup>cre+ </sup>had less wound Tregs compared to cre- littermate controls, and also impaired wound healing (Fig 1). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Tregs are decreased in diabetic wounds, driving persistent uncoordinated inflammation and pro-inflammatory phenotypes in other cell types. Notch signaling is decreased in diabetic wound T cells, decreasing Tregs and leading to impaired wound healing. Mice with T cell-specific Notch signaling deficiency also demonstrate decreased Treg formation and impaired wound healing. Thus Notch signaling may offer a potential therapeutic target to reduce pathologic inflammation in diabetic wounds.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are characterized by vascular inflammation and remodeling that can lead to aortic rupture resulting in significant risk of mortality. Resolvin D2 (RvD2) is a bioactive isoform of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that mediates resolution of tissue inflammation. Thus, we investigated the immunomodulatory role of RvD2-mediated signaling via GPR18 (a G-protein coupled receptor) in mitigating AAA formation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A topical elastase (0.4 U/mL type 1 porcine pancreatic elastase or heat-inactivated elastase) model was used to induce AAAs in C57BL/6 (wild-type; WT) male mice that were administered either a control (scramble) in vivo siRNA or siRNA for GPR18 (1nmol). RvD2 (300ng/kg) was given i.p. daily for 14 days. On day 14, the abdominal aortic diameter was measured by video micrometry and expressed as percentage increase over baseline. Cytokine expression in aortic tissue was quantified by multiplex assay. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze immune cell infiltration and elastic fiber disruption (Verhoeff Van Gieson staining). In vitro cultures of RAW264.7 macrophages were transfected with control or GPR18 siRNA and exposed to transient elastase (5 minutes) and treated with or without RvD2 (300nM). Proinflammatory cytokines were measured in supernatants after 24hrs by a multiplex assay. Groups were compared using ANOVA followed by Tukey&rsquo;s test and data is displayed as mean+/- SEM with p&lt;0.05 as statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Aortic diameter was significantly increased in elastase-treated WT mice compared to controls (208.9 &plusmn; 7.0% vs 0.00 &plusmn; 0.0%; n=5/group, p&lt;0.001). Elastase-treated WT mice administered with GPR18 siRNA had no significant change in AAA formation compared to mice treated with control siRNA (229.3 &plusmn; 8.1% vs. 211 &plusmn; 5.9%; n=10/group, p=0.3). Mice treated with control siRNA+RvD2 had a significant decrease in AAA formation compared to mice treated with GPR18 siRNA+RvD2 (134 &plusmn; 7.0% vs 175.5 &plusmn; 8.5%; n=8/group, p=0.002). A significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&beta; , MCP1, TNF-&alpha;, MIP-1&alpha; ), cell infiltration (CD3+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils), and elastic fiber disruption occurred in aortic tissue from elastase-treated WT mice administered control siRNA+RvD2 compared to mice administered with GPR18 siRNA+RvD2. In vitro studies demonstrated that RvD2 treatment significantly decreased proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1&beta; , MCP1, TNF-&alpha;, MIP-1&alpha; ) secretion from elastase-exposed macrophages transfected with control siRNA compared to GPR18 siRNA.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

These results suggest that RvD2-mediated decrease in aortic inflammation and vascular remodeling is mediated via GPR18 signaling on macrophages during AAA formation. Further studies will aim to characterize the cell-specific molecular mechanisms through which RvD2/GPR18 signaling prevents immune cell activation and mitigates AAA formation.

Recently, investigators have demonstrated that NK cells may be primed for improved cytotoxicity following exposure to activating antigens such as cytokines or cells infected with virus. For these reasons, investigators have paired NK cells with other therapies, such as the targeted immunotherapy, dinutuximab, for high-risk neuroblastoma. We hypothesized that an oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV), M002, could improve NK cell-directed cytotoxicity of neuroblastoma cells. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: SK-N-AS human neuroblastoma cells (NB) and a human NK cell line that is easily expanded ex vivo, NK92 MI, were utilized. To assess cytotoxicity associated with combinatorial therapy, NB cells were pre-labeled with CMFDA Cell Tracker Green (labels alive cells) and then treated with increasing multiplicity of infection (MOI) of M002 (0-5 plaque forming units (PFU)/cell) for 24 h. Cells were then co-cultured with NK92 MI cells at an effector:target (E:T) ratio of 10:1 (NK:NB) for 24 h. The co-cultured NB cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) to detect dead cells and assessed with flow cytometry. Percent cell lysis was determined by the following formula (CMFDA+/PI+) / [(CMFDA+/PI+) + (CMFDA+/PI-)] * 100. To assess priming, NK cells were exposed to NB cells that had been infected with M002 at MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell for 24 h. Primed NK cells were then co-cultured with M002 infected NB cells and cytotoxicity assessed as previously described. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Combination treatment with M002 and NK92 MI resulted in a significantly greater cytotoxic effect on NB cells than treatment with either virus or NK92 MI cells alone (Figure 1A). When NK92 MI cells were primed for 24 h through exposure to NB cells that had been previously infected with M002, there was a significant increase in the ability of the primed NK92 MI cells to kill NB cells (Figure 1B, striped bar) when compared to unprimed NK92 MI cells (Figure 1B, black bar). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have shown that NK92 MI cells are a promising candidate for combination therapy with M002 for NB. The combination of oHSV and NK cells resulted in significantly greater NB tumor cell cytotoxicity than either oHSV or NK cells alone. Furthermore, previous virus infection of NB cells assisted in priming the NK92 MI cells and consequentially created a more robust anti-tumor immune response to oHSV infected NB cells. These findings validate the need to study this phenomenon further and advance to an in vivo model in anticipation for translation to the clinical arena.

This tumor suppressor function of PP2A is downregulated in many cancers, often through upregulation of its endogenous inhibitors, prominently I2PP2A (SET) and CIP2A. Our lab has shown that two novel PP2A activating molecules, ATUX-792 and DBK-1154, decreased neuroblastoma growth and motility. Serine-threonine kinase receptor associated protein (STRAP) is a scaffolding protein that is itself regulated by phosphorylation. We have demonstrated that genetic knockout of STRAP using CRISPR-Cas9 technology led to increased abundance of CDKN3 mRNA, a marker of neuroblastoma differentiation. Because of our and other investigators&rsquo; prior findings supporting the role of STRAP in promoting cancer, we hypothesized that PP2A activation may negatively regulate STRAP in neuroblastoma, resulting in a decreased malignant phenotype.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Two neuroblastoma cell lines, SK-N-AS and SH-EP, were utilized. Cells were treated with either ATUX-792 or DBK-1154, PP2A activating compounds, for 24 hours. Immunoblotting detected protein expression. Real-time PCR (qPCR) examined abundance of mRNA for STRAP and CDKN3, a neuroblastoma differentiation marker, following PP2A activation. Flow cytometry documented alterations in cell surface expression of CD133, a marker of neuroblastoma cell stemness.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Treatment with increasing doses of ATUX-792 or DBK-1154 resulted in decreased abundance of STRAP mRNA and decreased STRAP protein expression in SK-N-AS and SH-EP cells. PP2A activator treatment resulted in an increase in CDKN3 mRNA abundance as detected by qPCR in both cell lines. Cell surface expression of CD133 was decreased following 5 &mu;M treatment of either ATUX-792 (85 &plusmn; 0.04% versus untreated, p &le; 0.05) or DBK-1154 (72 &plusmn; 0.04% versus untreated, p &le; 0.001) in SK-N-AS cells, indicating a decrease in stemness.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: PP2A activation in SK-N-AS and SH-EP neuroblastoma cell lines using ATUX-792 or DBK-1154 resulted in decreased STRAP mRNA abundance and total protein expression. In addition, PP2A activation increased the differentiation marker, CDKN3, and decreased expression of a stemness marker, CD133. These findings suggest that PP2A activation functions, in part, through STRAP to decrease the malignant phenotype in neuroblastoma, and PP2A activating drugs warrant further investigation as potential neuroblastoma therapeutics.

These tumors are classified into four groups: WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4. Group 3 tumors account for nearly one third and portend the worst prognosis with less than 50% of children surviving 10 years. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that functions as a tumor suppressor but is downregulated in medulloblastoma. Researchers have previously shown that activation of PP2A decreased medulloblastoma tumor growth. Our collaborator created second-generation PP2A activating compounds, ATUX-6954 and ATUX-6156, designed to more efficiently activate PP2A. We hypothesized that these molecules would decrease viability, proliferation, and stemness in Group 3 medulloblastoma.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: D425 human Group 3 medulloblastoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) cells were utilized. D425 cells were treated with increasing doses of ATUX-6954 and ATUX-6156. Viability and proliferation were measured using colorimetric assays. Immunoblotting examined the effects of ATUX-6954 and ATUX-6156 on downstream cell signaling cascades. Extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA) evaluated tumorsphere forming ability, a measure of stemness, after treatment for one week with ATUX-6954 (1.5 &micro;M) and ATUX-6156 (1.5 &micro;M). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Treatment of D425 cells with ATUX-6954 for 24 hours significantly decreased viability (LD<sub>50</sub> 3.9 &micro;M) and proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub> 5.3 &micro;M). ATUX-6156 treatment similarly significantly decreased viability (LD<sub>50</sub> 2.8 &micro;M) and proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub> 3.2 &micro;M) at 24 hours. Increasing doses of ATUX-6954 and ATUX-6156 led to a decrease in AKT phosphorylation. In addition, ATUX-6954 decreased expression of two endogenous PP2A inhibitors, SET and CIP2A. ELDA showed a significant decrease in D425 tumorsphere formation after ATUX-6954 (p &lt; 0.0001) and ATUX-6156 (p &lt; 0.0001) treatment, indicating decreased stemness (Fig 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have shown that two PP2A activating compounds, ATUX-6954 and ATUX-6156, decreased Group 3 medulloblastoma PDX cell viability and proliferation, and that dephosphorylation of AKT may be the responsible mechanism. In addition, ATUX-6954 and ATUX-6156 decreased tumor cell stemness, a quality known to drive tumor resistance and relapse. These results indicate that ATUX-6954 and ATUX-6156 should be investigated further as potential medulloblastoma therapeutics.

Patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease (PAD) may have persistent muscle dysfunction which may be due to aberrant human muscle satellite cell (HuMSC) recovery. We showed that caspases 1 and 11 which are activated by inflammasomes mediate recovery from muscle ischemia in mice. Inflammatory caspase function in ischemic human muscle is not known. We hypothesized that caspase1 and/or caspases 4 and 5 (human analogs of caspase 11) can mediate myogenicity in ischemic HuMSC in PAD

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: HuMSC were isolated from ischemic tibialis anterior from proximal (P) and distal (D) areas using sequential plating and magnetic-activated cell sorting for CD56+ cells. Control myocytes from healthy donors were obtained from Cook MyoSite company. Caspase-Glo 1 (Promega) inflammasome assay was used to assess inflammatory caspase enzymatic activity in HuMSC from healthy and PAD donors. Activity was measured with and without poly(dA:dT; activator of the AIM2 inflammasome) and nigericin (activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome) in the presence or absence of YVAD (caspase-1 inhibition), and Z-VAD-FMK, (caspases 1 and 3-10 inhibition). Cell confluence and apoptosis was measured using Incucyte live cell imaging systems. Western blot confirmed presence of caspases 1,4, 5 (inflammatory) and caspase 3 (apoptotic) in healthy and PAD HuMSC.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

PAD HuMSC had significantly higher enzymatic caspase activity than controls cells (p&lt;0.02), which was markedly increased by poly (dA:dT, p&lt;0.001), but not nigericin (Fig.1). Z-VAD-FMK but not YVAD (&ldquo;inhibitor&rdquo; on Fig.1) significantly attenuated fluorometric detection of caspase activity. Correspondingly, immunoblotting demonstrated that in addition to caspase 3, inflammatory caspases 1 and 5 as well as downstream gasdermin D were present in HuMSC (p) but not caspase 4. Apoptosis was prominent during live-cell imaging in PAD but not control cells. 

 



<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Caspase activity related to both inflammation and apoptosis are elevated in PAD and likely play a role in myogenicity. Importantly, inflammatory caspase activity increases in response to activation of the AIM2 inflammasome which can sense DNA damage. Furthermore, while caspase1 is present in human HuMSC, inflammatory activity may be mediated by caspase 5, the analog for mouse caspase 11 also responds to inflammatory cytokine release in response to AIM2 activation and DNA damage. Thus, DNA damage associated with PAD may promote caspase 5 activity in human PAD in a manner analogous to mouse models, resulting in AIM2 activation, danger signal release and attenuated myogenicity.

AVF created in mice with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have reduced maturation and increased TGF-&beta;1 expression compared to AVF created in non-CKD mice, suggesting the presence of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Therefore, we hypothesized that the CKD environment promotes EndMT via the TGF-&beta; signaling pathway to promote AVF failure.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Aortocaval AVF were created in C57BL/6J mice, with control mice having sham procedures. CKD was created via 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx), with controls of no (0/6) or partial (3/6) nephrectomy. Endothelial cell (EC)-specific TGF&beta;RI II knockout (TGF&beta;RI II-KO) mice and control mice were also used. AVF diameter was determined using ultrasound at postoperative days 7, 14, and 21. AVF were harvested at days 7 or 21 and examined with histology, Immunofluorescence and Western blot.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In C57BL/6J wild-type mice, AVF+5/6Nx had significantly increased wall thickness (p&lt;0.0001) and increased immunoreactivity of collagen1 (p=0.022), collagen3 (p= 0.0047), TGF-&beta;1 (p=0.0217) and fibronectin (p=0.0315) compared to AVF+0/6Nx (day 21; n=6; ANOVA). Endothelial cells in AVF+5/6Nx had significantly increased immunoreactivity of the mesenchymal markers notch3 (p&lt;0.0001), vimentin (p&lt;0.0001) and FSP-1 (p=0.0189; day 21; n=6; t-test). AVF in both EC-TGF&beta;RI II-KO mice had significantly decreased mesenchymal markers notch3 (p&lt;0.0001), vimentin (p&lt;0.0001) and FSP-1 (p&lt;0.0001; day 21; n=6;t-test), consistent with reduced EndMT, as well as decreased wall thickness (p&lt;0.0001;) and increased diameter (p=0.0352; t-test; day 21; n=6-15).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: CKD promotes neointimal hyperplasia via EndMT during AVF maturation leading to AVF failure, Regulation of TGF&beta; signaling could be a novel therapeutic approach to improve AVF maturation.

We previously demonstrated that Prominin-1 (Prom1)-expressing hepatic progenitor cell (HPC) populations expand and give rise to biliary ductular reactions (DR). Null mutation of Prom1 or selective ablation of Prom1-expressing HPCs significantly decreases DRs and fibrosis. Fn14, which encodes the receptor for TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), is expressed by HPCs and promotes organ fibrogenesis. We recently showed Fn14 upregulation in a rhesus rotavirus (RRV) murine model of BA. Using a large, published RNA seq database, we found significant upregulation of FN14, PROM1 and downstream targets of the TWEAK/FN14 signaling pathway in BA infants compared to non-BA cholestasis infants. Therefore, we hypothesize that Fn14 signaling in Prom1-expressing HPCs promotes fibrosis in BA.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Experimental BA was induced in neonatal mice with intraperitoneal (IP) injection of RRV vs saline on postnatal day 3 (P3). Mice were then treated with daily IP injection of L524, an inhibitor of Fn14, or corn oil, from P6-P17. Livers were collected on P17 for analysis by qPCR, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization using RNA Scope. Single cell (sc) RNA seq analysis was performed to characterize gene expression changes in EpCAM(+) cells. EpCAM(+) derived murine liver organoids were isolated and grown in Matrigel.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: By in situ hybridization, we observed increased co-expression of Prom1 and Fn14 in periportal cells within DRs after RRV. scRNA Seq analysis of EpCAM(+) cells demonstrated a doubling in HPC-like cells expressing both Prom1 and Fn14 with RRV treatment (0.53% vs 1.00%). The stereotypic increase in fibrosis seen with RRV injury histologically quantified by collagen proportionate area was abrogated in mice treated with L524 (9.75&plusmn;2.17 vs 1.89&plusmn;0.43, p&lt;.001). Relative expression of fibrogenic extracellular matrix gene Collagen-1&alpha;1 was significantly reduced after treatment with L524 (3.74&plusmn;1.68 vs 1.42&plusmn;0.46, p=0.001). L524 reduced ductular reactions, which derive from Prom1-expressing HPCs, in RRV injured mice, as was cholangiocyte gene Keratin-19 expression (6.49&plusmn;1.32 vs 1.99&plusmn;1.28, p&lt;0.001). Downstream markers such as Matrix metalloproteinase-7 were also reduced in the L524 treatment group (42.95&plusmn;21.07 vs 13.60&plusmn;10.26, p&lt;0.001). Conversely, when treated with recombinant TWEAK, EpCAM(+) derived murine liver organoids, which co-express PROM1 and FN14; grow in a dose-dependent manner, in vitro. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Inhibition of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway results in decreased fibrosis and DR in a murine BA model. In contrast, treatment of PROM1(+)FN14(+) biliary organoids with TWEAK promotes growth. We conclude that FN14 pathway activation in Prom1-expressing HPC contributes to proliferation of profibrogenic ductular reactions.

However, recent studies suggest patients undergoing breast conservation have lower rates of recurrence. A 2013 meta-analysis by Houssami, et al. found that rate of mastectomy in patients who had preoperative MRI was 16%, twice as high as that in patients who did not have preoperative MRI. A multi-institutional analysis was performed to investigate the impact of modern MRI on surgical management of early-stage breast cancer (ESBC).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective comparative cohort study included patients with in-situ and invasive breast cancer eligible for breast conservation surgery from two institutions (NY and FL). Patients who received preoperative systemic therapy were excluded. Eligibility for breast conservation was defined as clinical stage Tis-2. Risk factors for bilateral or multicentric disease were compared between groups including breast density, menopausal status, and family history. The rate of ipsilateral mastectomy in lumpectomy-eligible women was compared between patients who did and did not receive preoperative MRI. Chi square analysis was used to compare rates between groups. P values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 505 patients diagnosed between 1/2016-4/2019 (NY) and 2/2020-12/2020 (FL) underwent primary surgery for ESBC. 434 did not receive neoadjuvant therapy and were included in the analysis. 292 (67.3%) had preoperative MRI. There was no difference in the proportion of patients who were premenopausal or who met criteria for genetic testing by family history. The largest dimension on preoperative imaging was similar between groups. Patients who had MRI were younger (median age 58 vs. 68, p&lt;0.001) and more likely to have group 3 or 4 breast density (64.5% vs. 27.1%, p&lt;0.001). Patients who underwent preoperative MRI were twice as likely to undergo mastectomy as initial surgery (32.6% vs. 15.3%, p&lt;0.001). The rate of re-excision was similar between groups (MRI 13.0% vs. no MRI 10.8% p=0.511). Of note, the final pathologic size of the invasive or in-situ component was similar between groups (Table 1). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Younger age and greater breast density are associated with preoperative MRI receipt and all three factors likely play a role in choosing mastectomy. Young women with dense breasts represent a unique cohort of patients that may be particularly susceptible to cancer-related worry and anxiety related to additional biopsies and therefore may be more likely to opt against continued breast imaging. Since approximately 70% of patients with ESBC undergo preoperative MRI, future work should focus on mitigating these challenges to improve shared decision-making.

The 21<sup>st</sup> Century Cures Act requires that institutions release all electronic health information to patients immediately, which has created a need for the development of educational tools designed to improve patient understanding when viewing their results independently. Therefore, we aimed to assess the patient perceived utility of educational materials for women receiving breast biopsy pathology reports.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An electronic survey was delivered to all women who were scheduled for a screening mammogram at four distinct mammography locations within a single health care system between June 28, 2021 and August 4, 2021. Patients were queried about their perception of the utility of four proposed educational resources designed for women receiving breast biopsy pathology reports.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 311 patients completed the survey (21.6% response rate). 96.1% of patients reported that a brief paragraph summarizing important results in non-medical language would be either very useful (86.8%) or useful (9.3%). Similarly, 92.9% of patients reported that an integrated tool, which would allow patients to hover over words or phrases and would provide additional information for those specific terms, would be either very useful (82.3%) or useful (10.6%). Fewer patients felt that an electronic pamphlet providing general information about their specific findings would be very useful (54.8%) or useful (25.2%). Lastly, generic electronic pamphlets provided prior to the receipt of results providing general information about multiple possible findings were perceived to be the least useful (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Women undergoing screening mammography perceived that a summary of key findings written in non-medical language and a tool that provides patients with additional information about specific medical terms in their report would be the most useful resources if they were viewing a breast biopsy pathology report independently. These findings support the development of tailored educational tools that are both integrated into the patient portal or result report and that are specific to the patient&rsquo;s findings. Clinician partnership with industry partners or hospital informatics teams may be required to achieve these goals.

Little data exists comparing TC between hypofractionated radiation (HR) and traditional radiation (TR) at a national level or across racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review of the National Cancer Data Base (2012-2016) on patients undergoing BCT for Stage I breast cancer (BC). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to compare TC of HR (within 5 weeks of initiation) and TR (within 7 weeks) and to look at the effects of patient, tumor, and facility characteristics on TC.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 188,781 patients with Stage I BC who underwent BCT were studied with 58.4% receiving TR (n=110,176) and 41.6% receiving HR (n=78,605). 83.3% of patients achieved TC of radiation overall. 94.7% of patients receiving HR achieved TC, while only 75.2% of patients in the TR cohort achieved TC (p&lt;0.0001). Across categories of year of diagnosis, age, race, median income, facility type, tumor size, and chemotherapy use, it was found that frequency of TC was greater in HR compared to TR. The effect on TC by these factors was different in HR patients compared to TR in all categories except median income and tumor size. Regarding race, both treatment groups demonstrated that Blacks (OR(HR)=0.842, OR(TR)=0.819) and Hispanics (OR(HR)=0.886, OR(TR)=0.928) had reduced rates of TC compared to Whites. However, all racial groups benefitted substantially in TC of HR over TR (Blacks 92.3% v 69.7%, Hispanics 92.7% v 73.1%, Whites 94.9% v 76%). Lower median income and high school graduation rate for patients&rsquo; ZIP code were associated with lower odds of TC for both HR and TR (both p&lt;0.0001). Additionally, urban patients in both treatment groups had reduced odds of TC compared to rural patients (OR(HR)=0.919, OR(TR)=0.849, p&lt;0.0001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: TC of radiation therapy in BCT is significantly greater for patients receiving HR than TR. Additionally, there are treatment disparities across racial and socioeconomic cohorts. However, all groups experienced greater frequency of TC with HR. Providers may improve compliance with TC and potentially impact mortality and DFS by treating patients with HR when clinically feasible and targeting at-risk populations for treatment with HR.

This study aimed to characterize types of preventable intraoperative delays encountered during robotic-assisted thoracic surgery cases, operating room (OR) staff awareness/perceptions of delays, and subsequent cost impact of delays on overall operative costs. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery cases were observed from May to August 2019 for intraoperative delays. Cases were directly observed by three third-party researchers for intraoperative delays and post-operative surveys were given to operating room (OR) staff to elicit perceived delays. Delays were classified into categories. Observed versus perceived intraoperative delays were compared. Cost data for each case were obtained and cost per minute delay determined for each case. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Forty-four cases were observed, including anatomic lung resections, esophagectomy, Heller myotomy, and thymectomy procedures. A total of 71 delays were recorded across 75% of cases (n=33), with an average of 1.6&plusmn;1.5 delays per case and average delay length of 3.6&plusmn;5.3 minutes. There was a significant difference in number of delays recorded: equipment failure (n=40, average length of delay 5.0&plusmn;6.5 minutes), equipment missing (n=15, 2.2&plusmn;1.4 minutes), staff unfamiliarity with equipment (n=4, 3.4&plusmn;1.5 minutes), other (n=12, 4.5&plusmn;5.3 minutes) (p&lt;0.0001). No delays were recorded due to staff unfamiliarity with the procedure. Categories of delays identified between observers, surgeons (response rate 81.8%), first assistants (response rate 75%), surgical technologists (response rate 77.3%), and circulating nurses (response rate 84.1%) were significantly different (p=0.0007) (Table 1). While third-party observers noted no delays in only 25% (n=11) of cases, of the surveyed OR staff, 60.5% of surgeons, 56.3% of first assistants, 60.6% of surgical technologists, and 55.6% of circulating nurses perceived no delays. Based on third-party observations, average cost of delays per procedure was $1480.59&plusmn;$2040.96. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Multiple short but possibly preventable intraoperative delays can be observed in robotic thoracic procedures, which add up to significant cost burden. Lack of perception of intraoperative delays may further hinder operating teams from effectively closing the variable cost gaps. Equipment failure represented a significant portion of intraoperative delays in our study population, indicating a potential opportunity for cost reduction. Future studies are needed to explore methods of increasing perception of delays and opportunities for improvement.

Different treatment options have variable impact on QOL. Precision Breast Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (PB-IORT), a novel form of IORT, improves upon conventional breast IORT by incorporating high-dose-rate brachytherapy with CT imaging for delivery of a single dose of highly conformal radiation to the lumpectomy cavity at the time of breast conserving surgery. The primary aim of this study was to investigate patient-perceived QOL after PB-IORT.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All patients treated with PB-IORT as part of a phase II multi-institution clinical trial were included. Demographics and tumor pathology were abstracted from a prospective database. Patients were given the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) encompassing global health, functionality, and symptomatology at baseline, 1-month, 6-months, 12-months, and 24-months after PB-IORT. Scores were on a 100-point scale with change greater than 10 considered clinically significant. Scores at interval follow-up were compared to baseline using repeated measures modeling with an unstructured covariance matrix.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The cohort included 303 participants with a median age of 64 years (IQR: 52, 76). Median follow-up time was 24 months, indicative of completing all five surveys. One month after PB-IORT, there was a decline from baseline observed in physical functioning (-2.5, 95% CI: -4.4 - -0.55, p = 0.01), social functioning (-3.0, 95% CI: -5.5 - -0.42, p = 0.02), and role functioning, which includes ability to perform work, childcare, and leisure (-7.6, 95% CI: -11.7 - -3.5, p &lt; .001) (Figure). This decline correlated with increased fatigue (8.4, 95% CI: 5.5-11.3, p &lt; 0.001). At 6-month follow up, nearly all QOL measures returned to baseline or improved except for cognitive functioning which declined significantly from baseline at 6, 12, and 24 months (p &lt; 0.05). All functional and symptom scale differences were less than 10, indicating minimal clinical significance. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences from baseline in global health.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While patients treated with PB-IORT showed a short-term decline in physical, role and social functioning, these changes were of minimal clinical significance. The sustained decline in cognitive functioning may be attributable to subsequent treatment, such as endocrine therapy, which warrants further study. These data support the use of PB-IORT as a patient-centered treatment option for women with early-stage breast cancer.

Previous studies have demonstrated that patients have poor understanding of medical jargon. However, patient comprehension of terminology specific to breast pathology reports has not been well studied. We assessed patient understanding of common medical terms found in breast pathology reports.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A 29-question survey was administered by email to patients scheduled for a screening mammogram at four distinct locations within a multisite healthcare system between June 28, 2021 and July 16, 2021. Participants were asked to objectively define and interpret 8 medical terms common to breast biopsy pathology reports. Patient-generated definitions were categorized as correct, partially correct, or incorrect by two independent reviewers using a rubric of definitions. Any discrepancies in scoring were then reviewed by a 3<sup>rd</sup> independent reviewer. Health literacy was independently evaluated using three previously validated screening questions. Demographic information including education level, previous cancer diagnosis, and primary language was also collected. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 147 patients completed the survey (21.3% response rate). 74% of the respondents had adequate health literacy and 96% of the respondents reported English as their primary language. A majority of respondents (76%) correctly defined three or fewer medical terms and no participant correctly defined all eight terms. &lsquo;Malignant&rsquo; and &lsquo;Benign&rsquo; were the terms defined correctly most often (80%, 73% respectively). Conversely, the terms &lsquo;High Grade (1%)&rsquo; and &lsquo;Carcinoma (3%)&rsquo; were least frequently defined correctly. However, 61% of patients still correctly interpreted &lsquo;High Grade&rsquo; as &lsquo;bad news,&rsquo; while 88% correctly interpreted &lsquo;Carcinoma&rsquo; as &lsquo;bad news&rsquo;. &lsquo;Neoplasm&rsquo; had the highest share (48%) of &lsquo;unsure&rsquo; or blank responses.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Patient comprehension of medical jargon common to breast biopsy pathology reports is poor even in a population with adequate health literacy. With the newly mandated immediate release of information to patients through the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Cures Act, there is a pressing need to develop educational tools to support patients viewing result reports independently.

Tran<sup>1</sup>, M. Park<sup>1</sup>, P. Benharash<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of California - Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
While expedited discharge following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been postulated as a possible solution for reducing resource utilization, concerns about patient safety and outcomes remain. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of expedited postoperative discharge on readmissions at 90-days and costs in patients undergoing isolated CABG.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Adults (&ge;18 years) who underwent an isolated CABG were identified using the 2016-2018 Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD). Patients were classified as expedited or non-expedited, with expedited patients being discharged on or before postoperative day 4. Those with prolonged hospitalization durations (&ge;8 days) or who experienced perioperative complications were excluded. Entropy balancing was utilized to adjust for baseline differences across groups. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models adjusting for demographic, clinical and hospital factors were utilized to assess key clinical outcomes including index hospitalization costs and non-elective readmission at 90-days.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 208,000 included for analysis, 75,428 (36.3%) experienced expedited discharge. Expedited patients were on average younger (63.4 vs 66.1 years, p&lt;0.001), more frequently male (82.6 vs 74.8%, p&lt;0.001) and more commonly carried private insurance (42.6 vs 31.7%, p&lt;0.001). Compared to those who were non-expedited, they had a lower burden of comorbidities as defined by Elixhauser comorbidity index (2.48 vs 3.08 points, p&lt;0.001) but received care at high volume centers at similar rates (74.9 vs 73.6%, p=0.19). Expedited patients experienced lower index hospitalization costs ($32,024 vs 38,869, p&lt;0.001), were discharged to home more frequently (55.2 vs 40.5%, p&lt;0.001) and exhibited similar rates of readmission within 90-days (4.7 vs 5.0%, p=0.24) compared to non-expedited patients. After adjustment and entropy balancing, expedited discharge was associated with similar odds of readmission within 90-days (AOR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87-1.01) compared to the non-expedited cohort, but lower costs at the index hospitalization (&szlig;: - $5,803, 95% CI: -5,995 to -5,612) and upon readmission (&szlig;: - $56,409, 95% CI: -7,357 to -5,460, Figure). Of note, 24.2% of hospitals did not perform any expedited discharges.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Expedited discharge decreases costs of care for patients undergoing isolated CABG, without an increase in unplanned readmission. While some patients may benefit from prolonged hospital durations, expedited discharge should be considered as a strategy to both improve postoperative patient care and reduce resource utilization within the US healthcare system.

Most women diagnosed with breast cancer will undergo surgery as a part of their curative treatment. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are complications that can delay discharge and negatively impact patient outcomes. This is a significant clinical problem as PONV can lead to wound dehiscence, pain, immobility, increased length of stay (LOS), increased hospital costs and poor patient satisfaction. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols are a combination of evidence-based strategies applied to traditional perioperative practices to reduce postoperative complications. Though ERAS has been well researched in various fields, it remains underutilized in investigating PONV in breast surgeries. We sought to investigate if the implementation of ERAS in patients undergoing mastectomy with breast reconstructive surgery led to a decreased LOS and decreased PONV.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Our data set consisted of 138 ERAS cases and 96 non-ERAS controls. All patients were at least 18 years old and underwent mastectomy with immediate implant or tissue expander-based reconstruction between 2/6/2018-1/23/2020. The non-ERAS group consisted of procedure-matched controls that were not treated under the ERAS protocol since July 31, 2016. We conducted a chart review to gather the following data: migraine history, presence of PONV, length of PONV, duration of operation, total IV fluids, estimated blood loss, LOS, patient smoking status, induction of a pectoral nerve block, administration of Celebrex, IV Tylenol, Gabapentin, Scopolamine patch, and Zofran use post-operatively. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In univariate comparisons, we find presence of post-op nausea, number of days of post-op nausea, LOS and postoperative use of Zofran are significantly different between ERAS and non-ERAS controls. Patients that underwent mastectomy with immediate reconstruction under the ERAS protocol had significantly decreased postoperative nausea when compared to the control group (mean 37.5% of controls vs. 18.1% of ERAS, p&lt;0.001). Additionally, ERAS patients experienced shorter LOS and were able to return home more quickly than the control group (1.21 vs 1.49 days, p &lt;0.001). Using a multivariable regression to control for potential confounders, ERAS protocol was associated with less post-operative nausea (odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13-0.5), length of stay 1 day vs &gt;1 day (OR=0.19, 95% CI 0.1-0.35) and less post-operative Zofran use (OR=0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.07). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The importance of publishing outcomes collected from ERAS protocols in women undergoing curative breast cancer surgery is to provide data to improve patient outcomes and experiences. Our results indicate that implementation of the ERAS protocol in women undergoing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction does improve patient outcomes in nausea and LOS.

Singhal<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania, Division Of Thoracic Surgery, Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Despite curative-intent resection, lung cancers can recur locally due to incomplete disease clearance. Intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI) with tumor-specific contrast agents can identify occult disease, but false negative and false positive diagnoses have been reported. While false negatives by IMI are well-studied, false positives are incompletely understood. We analyzed our five-year experience with a folate receptor alpha (FR&alpha;)-targeted tracer (OTL38) for IMI of pulmonary adenocarcinoma to describe potential mechanisms for false positivity.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

239 patients with a pulmonary nodule suspicious for malignancy were enrolled in a phase I trial of IMI. Subjects received OTL38 (intravenous, 0.025mg/kg) 24 hours prior to resection. Intraoperatively, lesions were imaged with a near-infrared (NIR) thoracoscope designed to detect OTL38. Specimens were submitted for analysis by a thoracic pathologist. Lesion characteristics were collected for lesions that fluoresced intraoperatively but were histologically benign. ImageJ was used to analyze NIR images and calculate mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of false positive lesions and signal-to-background (SBR) ratios. Immunohistochemistry for FR&alpha;, folate receptor beta (FR&beta;), CD68, and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on the lesions.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Within the study cohort, 13 patients (5.4%) had false positive lesions. Mean patient age was 69.2 years (IQR: 64-75). Most patients were female (n=9, 69.2%) and former smokers (n=10 [76.9%], 24.3 mean pack years). Mean lesion size was 1.23 cm (IQR: 0.88-1.50 cm) and mean depth was 0.28 cm from the pleural surface (IQR: 0-0.40 cm). By histopathological analysis, all false positives were benign inflammatory lesions, including necrotizing granuloma (n=7, 53.8%), non-necrotizing granuloma, foreign body giant cell reaction, reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, subpleural fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, and an inflammatory myofibroblastic lesion (all n=1, 7.7%). Mean lesion MFI was 89.30 arbitrary units (A.U.) (IQR: 77.24-106.00 A.U.) and mean SBR was 3.27 (IQR:2.60-3.55). By IHC analysis, FR&alpha; expression was low (0/1+ staining intensity) in false positive lesions, but FR&beta; expression was high (2+/3+). This staining co-localized with CD68 staining and OTL38 on immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 1 for a representative case), indicating that OTL38 is taken up by FR&beta;-expressing macrophages in false-positive lesions.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Benign inflammatory lesions are the predominant source of false positivity in OTL38-based IMI due to tracer uptake by FR&beta;-expressing macrophages. These findings should be considered by thoracic surgeons when assessing fluorescent lesions during IMI-guided pulmonary resection.

Requirements for establishment of heart teams, structural heart expertise, availability of appropriate operating suites, as well as financial considerations have been cited as potential barriers to adoption of TAVR. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate for the presence of regional disparities in access to and outcomes following TAVR in California.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development database was queried for patients undergoing TAVR or isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) from 2008 to 2018. The state of California was divided into 7 regions: Northern California, San Francisco Bay Area, Central California, Los Angeles, Inland Empire, Orange, and San Diego. Regional TAVR volumes were normalized to the number of regional Medicare beneficiaries or isolated SAVR volume. Institutional level data was examined for trends in volume and outcomes. Outcomes included risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCE), a composite of death, postoperative myocardial infarction, stroke, and re-intervention, following TAVR.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Annual TAVR volume steadily increased since 2011, with 5,443 cases performed across California in 2018. The majority of TAVR programs (43, 72%) were established by 2016. Although isolated SAVR caseload decreased, total volume of aortic valve replacements increased to 7,766 in 2018 (Figure 1). After normalization, wide variation in utilization of TAVR was evident across California. At most, a 5.3-fold difference was present between the San Francisco Bay Area and Central California. TAVR to SAVR ratios in 2018 were greatest in Los Angeles (2.9) and San Diego (2.9), and least in Central California (1.7) and the Inland Empire (1.6). After risk adjustment, there were no significant regional differences in 30-day mortality, but lower 30-day MACCE in the San Francisco Bay Area.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Regional differences in TAVR utilization exist, with limited access in Central California and the Inland Empire, but risk-adjusted outcomes are similar. Efforts to reach underserved areas through expansion of existing programs or regional referral programs may distribute transcatheter technology more equitably across California. Furthermore, as other surgical and interventional techniques are developed, efforts to reduce disparities in access to care as these technologies are integrated into practice are imperative.

Racial disparities have been shown to persist in many operative specialties, including the management of congenital heart disease. Using a demographic-adjusted methodology, we examined whether patient race influenced access to high-volume centers for operative management of Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The 2005-2017 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried to identify all pediatric hospitalizations with a Norwood, Glenn, or Fontan procedure for HLHS. Hospital volume status was defined using deciles of annual congenital case volume, with high volume centers (HVC) being designated as centers above the seventh decile, an inflection point of caseload. The first and second deciles were excluded due to insufficient patients to meet NIS privacy guidelines (n&lt;10). To adjust for local racial demographics, we created a racial disparity index (RDI) for each hospital based on normalizing methodology: RDI=proportion of White patients receiving HLHS operations/White patients receiving appendectomy. Appendectomy was selected as a surrogate marker of the local demographic for each hospital as patients are infrequently transferred for this emergent procedure. This index compares the racial demographics of patients undergoing HLHS operations to those having surgery without a racial predilection in the surrounding area. Multivariable regression models were then used to assess outcomes of interest.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of an estimated 17,631 hospitalizations, 64.1% occurred at HVC with a mean annual operative volume of 33.0 cases per year. Compared to LVC, patients at HVC had a similar distribution of age, burden of comorbidities as described by the Charlson Index, and proportions of operative staging (all p&gt;0.05). However, patients at HVC were more likely to be White (48.3 vs 43.6%, p&lt;0.001), belong to the highest income quartile (21.8 vs 15.4%, p=0.01), and be privately insured (46.8 vs 38.2%, p=0.03). HVC had a higher mean RDI than LVC (2.1&plusmn;3.1 vs 1.1&plusmn;0.8, p&lt;0.001). The mean RDI steadily increased across volume deciles (0.79&plusmn;0.5 to 2.67&plusmn;4.2, p&lt;0.001) while average mortality decreased (13.1 to 5.0%, p&lt;0.001, Figure). After adjustment, each decile increase in hospital volume was associated with a 15% decrement in odds of mortality (AOR: 0.85/decile, 95% CI: 0.81-0.93). Although increasing volume was associated with reduced odds of non-home discharge (AOR: 0.94/decile, 95% CI: 0.90-0.98), it did not impact postoperative length of stay or adjusted costs.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

We demonstrate that high volume centers disproportionally serve White patients and have superior clinical outcomes compared to low volume. Our findings may help optimize referrals to expert centers for the care of HLHS.

Although anatomic lung resection with mediastinal lymph node sampling or dissection is the standard of care for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, wedge resection may offer similar long-term survival when compared to anatomic resection for elderly patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term outcomes of patients over 80 years old who undergo wedge resection vs. segmentectomy for stage IA NSCLC using a large clinical registry.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients in the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) ages 80 years and older who underwent wedge resection or segmentectomy for clinical T1a-b N0 M0 NSCLC between 2004-2018 were identified for analysis. We evaluated the overall survival of patients in the total cohort who underwent wedge resection vs. segmentectomy using Cox proportional hazard analysis and propensity&shy;-score&shy; matched analysis, matching for 15 common prognostic co&shy;variates including co-morbidities and tumor size. Subgroup analysis was performed among patients with lymph node dissection.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 2,690 patients over age 80 diagnosed with stage IA NSCLC in our cohort, 2,272 (84%) patients underwent wedge resection and 418 (16%) patients underwent segmentectomy. In the overall cohort, wedge resection was associated with worse five year and overall survival when compared to segmentectomy in both multivariable-adjusted (HR: 1.26, [1.06-1.51], p=0.01) and propensity score-matched analysis (49% [95% CI: 42%-55%] vs. 59% [95% CI: 52%-65%] 5-year survival, p=0.02). However, in a subgroup analysis of 1,221 (54%) patients who underwent wedge resection with lymph node dissection and 347 (15%) patients who underwent segmentectomy with lymph node dissection, there were no significant differences in five-year and overall survival between the two groups in both multivariable-adjusted (HR: 1.12, [0.90-1.39], p=0.31) and propensity score-matched analysis (55% [95% CI: 48%-62%] vs. 61% [95% CI: 54%-68%] 5-year survival, p=0.10).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this national analysis of patients over 80 years old diagnosed with stage IA lung cancer there were no significant differences in overall survival between patients who underwent wedge resection vs segmentectomy when lymph node dissection was performed with either operation. These findings suggest that, for adults over 80 years old, wedge resection and segmentectomy with intraoperative lymph node dissection may be considered similar in oncologic efficacy.

High volume surgeons and hospitals performing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have been associated with improved patient outcomes. However, patients of increased socioeconomic distress may have worse outcomes as a result of healthcare disparities. We sought to identify trends and outcomes in patients of elevated distress undergoing bypass grafting.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration administrative dataset was merged with CMS Physician and Hospital Compare and Economic Innovation Group Distressed Community Index datasets to build a comprehensive database. The dataset was queried to identify patients undergoing CABG procedures between 2016-2020. High and low volume hospitals (1,178-2,549 vs. 79-511 procedures performed annually) and surgeons (494-861 vs. 1-249 procedures performed annually) were compared. Patient and hospital demographics, co-morbidities, length of stay, and post-operative complications were analyzed by chi square and t-test where appropriate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 41,571 CABG procedures were performed by 174 surgeons at 67 Florida hospitals. Low volume (n=36) and high volume (n=6) hospitals did not differ with respect to hospital ownership, overall star rating, national comparisons of mortality, readmission, or cost effectiveness. Patients from at risk and distressed communities were more likely to undergo surgery at low volume hospitals (26.27% vs 23.85%, p&lt;0.001). Hospital length of stay was increased for low volume hospitals (10.2 vs 9.4 days, p&lt;0.05). Post-operative complications including pneumonia, arrhythmia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, shock, pleural effusion, and sepsis were more frequent at low volume hospitals and for low volume surgeons (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
High volume hospitals and surgeons have improved post-operative outcomes and hospital length of stay when compared to low volume hospitals and surgeons performing CABG. At risk and distressed populations are more likely to undergo bypass surgery at low volume hospitals, potentially contributing to worse patient outcome. Efforts should be made to mitigate the potential impact of low socioeconomic status to improve outcomes in this population.

Care fragmentation (CF), defined as disruption in continuity of care where patients are readmitted to a hospital other than the index, has previously been linked to worse outcomes following several operative categories. The present national study characterizes the incidence, risk factors and outcomes associated with care fragmentation following elective lung resections.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using the 2010-2018 National Readmission Database, we identified all adult (&ge;18 years) hospitalization for elective lung resections. Patient and operative characteristics were ascertained using the International Classification of Diseases, 9/10<sup>th</sup> Revision codes. Readmissions up to 90 days after index operation were tabulated. Patients who required unplanned readmission to a hospital other than the center performing the index resection were considered as the CF group (others: non-CF). Logistic and linear regression models were developed to identify risk factors and outcomes associated with CF. Centers were grouped into annual tertiles of lung resection volume with the highest tertile being considered as high-volume centers (HVC).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 472,475 patients receiving an elective lung resection (4.4% pneumonectomy, 70.2% lobectomy, 25.4% sub-lobar), 103,067 (22%) were readmitted within 90 days of discharge. Among them, 29,492 patients (28.6%) were considered to have CF. Compared to non-CF, the CF group were older (67&plusmn;12 vs 65&plusmn;14 years), more commonly belonged to the lowest income quartile (54% vs 51% p&lt;0.001), underwent robotic assisted resections (54.9% vs 51.8% p&lt;0.001), and were treated at a HVC (90% vs 88% p&lt;0.005). After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, CF was associated with increased odds of cerebrovascular events (AOR 1.82 p&lt;0.05) and thrombotic complications (AOR 1.27 p=0.03) upon readmission. Factors associated with CF include increasing age (AOR 1.01 p&lt;0.001), female gender (AOR 1.11 p&lt;0.001), metropolitan teaching hospital (AOR 1.43 p&lt;0.001), Medicaid insurance (AOR 1.24 p&lt;0.001) (Figure). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Care fragmentation affects nearly 25% of patients undergoing lung resections and is associated with increased risk of stroke and thrombotic complications. Post-discharge care coordination and programs to enhance longitudinal care in thoracic surgery may provide substantial cost savings while reducing complications.

The UK DCD Risk Score was established in 2018 as a risk stratification tool to predict 1-year post-LT graft loss. It consists of donor age, donor body mass index (BMI), warm ischemia time (WIT), cold ischemia time (CIT), recipient age, recipient laboratory Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and retransplantation status. We evaluated the applicability of the UK DCD Risk Score in a contemporary US cohort.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively computed the UK DCD Risk Scores and examined post-LT graft survival of adult DCD LT recipients between 01/2011-09/2020 using the United Network for Organ Sharing registry. Graft survival by UK DCD Risk Score groups was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox regression. The effect of the individual components of the UK DCD Risk Score on long-term and 1-year graft survival was assessed using multivariable Cox and logistic regression, respectively.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 3,899 DCD LTs were included in our study. A UK DCD Risk Score of 0-5 points was calculated in 1,438 (36.9%), 6-9 points in 1,920 (49.2%), and 10-20 points in 541 (13.9%). A UK DCD Risk Score of 0-5 was associated with decreased risk of graft loss compared with a score of 6-9 points (hazard ratio [HR]=0.80, 95%CI: 0.68-0.94, P=0.006), while a score of 10-20 points was associated with an increased risk of graft loss compared with a score of 6-9 points (HR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.01-1.51, P=0.04). The 5-year graft survival for patients with risk scores of 0-5, 6-9, and 10-20 are 75.9%, 71.7%, and 67.9%, respectively (Figure). Multivariable Cox regression incorporating all components of the UK DCD Risk Score showed that donor age &gt;60 years (adjusted HR[aHR]=1.78, 95%CI: 1.00-3.15, P=0.049), CIT &gt;6 hours (aHR=1.21, 95%CI: 1.05-1.40, P=0.01), recipient age &gt;60 years (aHR=1.27, 95%CI: 1.10-1.47, P=0.001), and retransplantation (aHR=2.80, 95%CI: 1.64-4.78, P&lt;0.001) were associated with an increased risk of long-term graft loss. However, donor BMI &gt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, WIT &gt;20 to &le;30 minutes or &gt;30 minutes, and recipient laboratory MELD score &gt;25 were not associated with the long-term risk of graft loss. Multivariable logistic regression in a subgroup of 2,957 DCD LTs with 1-year follow-up data showed donor age &gt;60 years (P=0.004), donor BMI &gt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (P=0.04), WIT &gt;20 to &le;30 minutes (P=0.02), CIT &gt;6 hours (P=0.003), recipient age &gt;60 years (P=0.005), recipient laboratory MELD score &gt;25 (P&lt;0.001), and retransplantation (P=0.007) to be associated with 1-year graft loss (C-statistic=0.611).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The UK DCD Risk Score demonstrates a more limited ability to differentiate recipient outcomes in the modern era of DCD LT in the US. However, acceptable outcomes are achievable even for patients stratified in the highest-risk group.

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is an evidence-based, multidisciplinary, peri-operative pathway designed to minimize the stress response, optimize recovery, and limit narcotic usage via multimodal analgesia. Use of ERAS in major abdominal surgeries has been reported to increase patient satisfaction and decrease pain, time to diet, length of stay, and cost. Implementation of an ERAS pathway for laparoscopic living donor nephrectomies (LLDN) has been slow as it is a major paradigm shift from the traditional over-hydration with forced diuresis to goal directed fluid therapy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of a quality improvement project that studied the ERAS implementation for LLDN was performed. Historical controls were compared to those ERAS participants. Key components of the ERAS protocol included 4-quadrant transversus abdominal block, intravenous anesthesia, multimodal pain therapy utilizing non-narcotic analgesia throughout the perioperative period, goal directed fluid therapy, and early nutrition and mobility. Fisher&rsquo;s exact and Mann Whitney tests evaluated the differences in pain metrics and functional status. Significance was estimated at p&lt;0.05. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
85 patients underwent LLDN from January 2017 to March 2021. 50 historical controls were compared to 35 ERAS participants. There were no differences in demographic characteristics. Total post-operative mean morphine equivalents (MMEs) were significantly lower in the ERAS group. Additionally, ERAS patients had lower mean pain scores and were more likely to report a pain score &le; 7. ERAS patients on postoperative day 1 were more likely to ambulate and tolerate a regular diet (14% v. 54.2%, p &lt; 0.000). Length of stay was longer in the control group compared to the ERAS group. Despite less intraoperative crystalloid (4.4 L &plusmn; 1.3 v. 2.1 L &plusmn; 0.85, p = 0.000) and longer intraoperative times (304.6 min &plusmn; 64.3 v. 378 min &plusmn; 80.9, p = 0.000), there was no difference in the peak creatinine. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The implementation of a standardized ERAS LLDN pathway was successful in lowering postoperative narcotic use, improving subjective pain control, improving early ambulation, and shortening length of stay. Despite longer OR times (due to block administration) and a decline in intraoperative crystalloid administration, there was no difference observed in kidney function.

The most common compression is between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta (anterior NS), while the compression between the aorta and the vertebral column is rare (posterior NS; 1-3% of cases). Treatment can be challenging due to lack of guidelines. Kidney autotransplant (KAT) is a surgical treatment for these patients, and is usually performed as an open approach. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that KAT is feasible and safe when used with minimal invasive techniques (laparoscopic- and robotic-assisted).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients with NS that underwent KAT between October 2017 and April 2021 were retrieved. Demographics, comorbidities, clinical diagnosis, CT scan, operative variables and early outcomes were collected. Results are presented as number (proportion) and median (IQR). Chi-square test, Wilcoxon test, and Kruskal-Wallis were performed to demonstrate differences between groups as appropriate. Safety outcomes included graft-, and patient-survival. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test were performed for survival analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 80 patients underwent KAT, 64 patients were retrieved. Of these 60 (94%) were females, and the median age was 25.5 (IQR 19-34). The median BMI was 22.5 (IQR 20-24.9). The patients had the following comorbidities: 35 (55%) had postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, 32 (50%) had median arcuate ligament syndrome and 15 (23%) had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Posterior nutcracker or circumaortic renal vein was identified in 10 (15.6%) patients (8 and 2 in the laparoscopic and robotic, respectively) and 36 (56%) had positive aortorenal block. Seven, 48, and 9 patients underwent open, laparoscopic and robotic KAT. Laparoscopic group had less surgical time than the open (189 m vs 221 m, p=0.028) and robotic group (189 m vs 243.5 m, p&lt;0.001) and lower estimated blood loss compared to the open group (75 ml vs 300 ml, p=0.01). LOS, complications at 30 days, graft- (p=0.78) and patient-survival (p=1) were similar between groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Laparoscopic approach for KAT seems feasible and safe. It has the advantages of reducing surgical time and estimated blood loss with no adverse impacts on early outcomes. It should be noted that robotic approach may be similar to laparoscopic approach once the learning curve for these cases is reached. Further multi-center studies are required to define treatment guidelines.

Prior studies have demonstrated age related changes in hemostasis and physiologic reserve. We sought to determine if age influences common physiologic derangements associated with pediatric massive transfusion.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All pediatric patients (1-18 years old) in the 2015-2018 TQIP database with complete age and blood transfusion data who met the MT definition of 40 cc/kg/24 hours were included. Data elements were cleaned to eliminate discrepancies in reporting blood volumes and erroneous values were excluded. Patients were stratified by age (infants: &ge; 1 year and &lt; 2 years, children: &ge; 2 years and &lt; 12 years, and adolescents: &ge; 12 years and &le; 18 years) based on American Academic of Pediatrics groupings. Demographic and outcomes data were analyzed and age differences were tested via Kruskal Wallis Test or Fisher&rsquo;s Exact Test. Pairwise group differences were tested with Bonferroni correction.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 1865 patients who met MT criteria. The median age was 11.0 (IQR: 5.0- 16.0) years and the median Injury Severity Score was 27.0 (IQR: 17.0- 41.0). The overall 24-hour and delayed mortality rates were 10.2% and 7.7%, respectively. There were no differences in mortality rates based on age. Infants had higher rates of intensive unit (ICU) admission compared to children and adolescents (94.5% vs 88.2% vs 82.0%, p&lt;0.001) and higher rates of ventilation (75.5% vs 66.8% vs 57.0%, p&lt;0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in stroke/cerebrovascular accident (CVA), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) based on age (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite infants having higher rates of ICU admission and need for ventilation, there were no differences in mortality based on age among those who are massively transfused. Additionally, rates of complications secondary to MT in pediatric patients are low compared to those reported in adults, further highlighting their resilience and ability to tolerate large volume resuscitation.

Hydroxyurea (HU) increases fetal hemoglobin production and results in less vaso-occlusive disease, presumably impeding auto-splenectomy. Treatment with HU has become widespread and recently became the standard of care for young children with SCD. We hypothesized that as HU gained widespread use, surgical splenectomy among SCD patients would occur at a higher rate and older age in those taking HU.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) national database was queried for all SCD ICD 9 and 10 diagnosis codes as well as splenectomy procedure codes from 1/1/2005 &ndash; 12/31/2020. HU use was defined as at least one hospital admission with HU listed as a medication. We compared the rate of surgical splenectomy among SCD patients on HU and not on HU and the age at which splenectomies occurred. Hospital length of stay and need for blood transfusion during the splenectomy admission were compared among groups. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During this period, we identified 42,497 SCD patients in the PHIS database and 50% were male. The overall surgical splenectomy rate was 2.9% and was relatively stable. The rate of surgical splenectomy was higher among patients on HU compared to those not on HU (8.3%, n = 585/7015 vs 1.4%, n = 514/35,482 p &lt; 0.01, Figure 1). In the HU group, the average age at splenectomy was 6.4 years vs 8.1 years in the no HU group, p&lt;0.01. There was no significant difference in hospital length of stay. Those receiving HU had an increased need for blood transfusion during the splenectomy admission (29.2% HU vs 23.9% no HU, p &lt; 0.03).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: While the overall rate of surgical splenectomy in SCD patients has remained stable, HU use is associated with a higher rate of surgical splenectomy. This may reflect the 2014 shift in national guidelines that supports HU use among SS children as young as 9 months, which has been proven to prevent auto-infarction (Baby Hug study). Preserved splenic function may then lead to greater need for surgical splenectomy. The higher rate of blood transfusion during the splenectomy admission among those on HU may indicate increased transfusion requirement or more technically challenging procedures in the HU group. Further investigation is warranted into the age of initiation and duration of HU use among the different SCD genotypes and associated requirement for surgical splenectomy.

Fetuses with large lung lesions including congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAMs) are at risk for cardiopulmonary compromise. Prenatal maternal betamethasone (BMZ) and cyst drainage for micro and macrocystic lesions respectively have improved outcomes yet some lesions remain large and require resection before birth (open fetal surgery, OFS), at delivery via an ex-utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT), or immediately post Caesarian section (section-to-resection, STR). We sought to compare prenatal characteristics and outcomes in fetuses undergoing OFS, EXIT, or STR to inform resection decision-making.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single institution retrospective review was conducted evaluating patients undergoing OFS, EXIT, or STR for prenatally diagnosed lung lesions from 2000-2021. Specimens were reviewed by an anatomic pathologist. Non-CCAMs were excluded from subsequent analyses. Prenatal variables included initial, greatest, and final CCAM-volume-ratio (CVR), BMZ use/frequency, cyst drainage, and the presence of hydrops. Outcomes included resolution of hydrops, survival, ECMO, NICU length of stay (LOS), postnatal nitric oxide use, and ventilator days.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Sixty-nine percent (59 of 85 patients) of lung lesions undergoing resection were CCAMs, of which 24% were microcystic. The incidence of microcystic lesions was greater in OFS than EXIT or STR (p = 0.008). Mean CVR was greater than 1.6 in all groups with the largest and final CVRs being significantly larger in the OFS group. Similarly, the incidence of hydrops was significantly greater and hydrops resolution did not occur preresection in the OFS group. Although the rate of cyst drainage did not differ between groups, maternal BMZ use varied significantly (OFS 60.0%, EXIT 100.0%, STR 74.3%; p = 0.038). Notably, all OFS took place prior to 2013. There was no difference in survival, nitric oxide, NICU LOS, or ECMO between groups. However, ventilator days were lower in STR compared to EXIT but not OFS. Hydrops independently predicted the use of ECMO and higher initial CVR predicted NICU LOS and ventilator days. In multiple variable logistic modeling, determinants of survival included no hydrops, a lower initial CVR, and need for &lt;3 steroid doses.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
For CCAMs that remain large despite maternal BMZ or cyst drainage, surgical resection via OFS, EXIT, or STR are viable options. Favorable and comparable survival between groups highlights the importance of patient selection for different resections. Factors such as the increasing use of BMZ and cyst drainage over time as well as a Children&rsquo;s Hospital Special Delivery Unit that facilitates STR may account for the reduced need for OFS and the lower average CVR seen in the more contemporary cohorts of EXIT and STR.

Surgical resection is the cornerstone of treatment; however, the optimal factors regarding the extent of fibrosarcoma resection in localized versus regional disease is poorly understood. This study sought to examine survival characteristics of children with fibrosarcoma and factors predictive of survival, particularly whether extent of surgery confers a survival advantage.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was queried for all patients 19 years and younger with a diagnosis of fibrosarcoma from 1973-2015. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed for disease-specific survival (DSS) on clinical and pathologic variables. Multivariate analysis was performed based upon significant covariate predictors of DSS. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 26 (IBM Corp).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 1,290 patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 11.44 years (SD=6.23). Forty-two percent of patients were 15-19 years old. Males and females were equally represented. Overall survival rates at 5, 10 and 20 years were 94%, 93% and 93%, respectively. 22% of patients with localized, 40% of patients with regional, and 52% of patients with distant SEER stage of disease underwent radical resection. After excluding patients with distant stage (N=38); decade (&lt;2000 and &gt;2000), radiation, histology, and stage were all significant using univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The majority of patients (86%) with localized or regional stage that underwent radiation were of non-dermatofibroma histology. Dermatofibrosarcoma subtype comprised the majority of radical resections (41%). Multivariate analysis excluding distant stage showed that non-dermatofibroma histology (HR= 16.94, 95% CI 3.77-76.01; P &lt;0.001) and regional stage (HR=8.15, 95% CI 2.93-22.69; P &lt;0.001) were independent prognostic factors of mortality. Radical resection was not a significant independent prognostic indicator of survival (Table 1).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Fibrosarcoma is a rare malignancy in the pediatric population. Non-dermatofibrosarcoma subtype was independently associated with worse mortality. Although surgery remains the mainstay of treatment, the extent of resection is not a predictor of survival for patients with localized and regional stage of disease.

Pilonidal disease affects 26 out of 100,000 patients annually and may present as acute abscesses or chronic draining sinuses. There is no standard treatment and recurrence rates remain high (up to 30%). Within a 5-hospital network, including academic, county, and community hospitals, we have established a standardized minimally invasive surgical trephination protocol followed by laser hair removal. We hypothesize that standardized pilonidal treatment protocol can be established across different hospital settings and lead to improved outcomes regardless of where the initial surgery was performed.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
132 patients with pilonidal disease were treated at our hospital network from 2019-2021. Patients that underwent initial surgery outside our hospital system or were noncompliant with our laser hair removal protocol were excluded. Patients were grouped based on surgeon and treating facility. Frequencies of recurrence per surgeon and per hospital were calculated and analyzed using ANOVA. P value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Out of 132 patients, 80 patients were included (45 female, 35 male) while 52 were excluded due to initial surgery at a non-network hospital or for noncompliance to our protocol. Average age was 17.8&plusmn;3.2 years and average length of follow-up was 345&plusmn;186 days. There were 6 patients who experienced at least one recurrence and required re-excision. An average of 156&plusmn;95 days passed between initial excision and re-excision. There was an overall 8% recurrence rate with no significant difference noted between surgeons or hospitals (p=0.15, p=0.64 respectively) (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We have successfully implemented a standardized minimally invasive treatment protocol to treat pilonidal disease across different hospital settings and by different surgeons. This standardization has led to a low recurrence rate. These findings suggest that adoption of a standard protocol for treatment of this troublesome disease may lead to lower recurrence rates and fewer operations.

However, little is known about the association between ACS pediatric trauma center designation and outcomes following trauma suffered during dog attacks. Utilizing the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) data from 2007-2016, we sought to analyze the relationship between ACS trauma designation and the outcomes of pediatric patients suffering these injuries.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The NTDB was queried to identify pediatric (age 0-19y) dog bite trauma patients, who were admitted to ACS pediatric level I or II trauma centers from 2007-2016. Chi-Squared and Odds Ratio statistical analyses were used to compare the outcomes of these patients, including such variables as: Patient Ethnicities, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS; Shock Index), Course of Stay (Length of Stay, ICU Days, Ventilator Days), and Disposition. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of those treated at level I or II trauma centers from 2007-2016, a total of 6,196 pediatric dog bite trauma patients were identified. 4,415 of them were admitted to a level I ACS verified center, and the remaining 1,781 patients were admitted to a level II facility. Statistical analysis of the data indicated that patients with an ISS of &ldquo;Severe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Very Severe&rdquo; are more likely to die than those with an ISS score of &ldquo;Mild&rdquo; (OR=57.6, p&lt;0.01; OR=581, p&lt;0.01). Additionally, when GCS is &ldquo;Severe,&rdquo; the odds of dying in a level II facility is 4.8x the odds of dying in a level I facility (p=0.013). Patients admitted to level I facilities spent 0.807 more days in the hospital (p&lt;0.01), 1.13 more days in the ICU (p&lt;0.01) and 2.16 more days on a ventilator when compared to those admitted to level II facilities (p&lt;0.01). However, the odds of a patient being successfully discharged home from a level II trauma center after suffering these injuries, is significantly lower than those managed at a level I trauma center (OR=0.406, p&lt;0.01).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pediatric dog-bite patients managed at ACS level I trauma centers were more likely to experience a longer hospital stay as well as more days spent on a ventilator and in the ICU. However, if their injuries were severe in nature, they were more likely to survive had they been managed in a level I facility rather than a level II. Also, the likelihood of being successfully discharged home was higher had the patient been cared for at a level I trauma center rather than a level II. Given these results, the ACS trauma center designation can be a predictor of discharge disposition and mortality in pediatric patients with trauma due to dog bites. These findings suggest that pediatric dog-bite victims with severe injuries be treated at ACS level I trauma centers versus level II in order to maximize their chances of survival.

Other variables included etiology of bowel obstruction, pre-operative serum electrolytes, Hemoglobin concentration and cadre of operating surgeon amongst others. We collected the data using a semi structured questionnaire and analyzed it with STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp, TX, USA). Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses and odds ratios (OR) were computed at 95% confidence interval, regarding p&lt;0.05 as statistically significant.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Majority 45(60.8%) of participants were males with mean age of 1.06 years &plusmn;2.53 SD. The main causes of bowel obstruction were intussusception and anorectal malformations. Majority 67(90.5%) underwent surgical exploration whereas 2(2.7%) were treated conservatively. Mortality at 14 days was 24.6% (n=18) of which 4(5.4%) died before surgery and 1(1.4%) child ran away before definitive intervention. The mean duration of symptoms before presentation to hospital for who those survived was 4.59 (SD &plusmn;7.11) and 4.53 (SD&plusmn; 3.66) for those who succumbed to death. The average length of hospital stay was 7.055 days &plusmn; 9.15 SD. Having gut perforation at the time of surgery was the main risk for mortality [OR: 16.69, 95% CI (1.448-198.79); P=0.024].


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The mortality due to pediatric intestinal obstruction was high with 1 in every 4 children dying from the disease. Gut perforation resulting from late presentation was the main death risk, warrantying the need to have senior surgical coverage at the time of operation. Public health education with key messages targeting early detection of bowel obstruction in this population and improvement in post-operative pediatric critical care services could avert the increased mortality burden.

Islam<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Florida, Pediatric Surgery, Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SP) is an uncommon event in children and young adults, but raises concerns for life threatening diagnoses. These concerns lead to frequent use of advanced imaging, hospitalizations, and interventions that are unnecessary. We reviewed our experience with SP to understand outcomes and create a pathway for reduced resource utilization.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of all cases with SP between 5 and 24 years of age over a 10 year period was carried out, and clinical, demographic, hospital, and outcome variables were collected and analyzed. Patients with pneumomediastinum that was operative, traumatic, or related to interventions were excluded, as were cases in which incomplete records were found. Pre-existing conditions or events surrounding the diagnosis were recorded.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 168 SP in 163 patients were included with a mean age of 17.6 years, 73% male, 68.5% White patients. All were evaluated in the ED, with 64% presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset. Chest pain and torso tenderness were the most common symptom and sign. Chest X ray was done in 94%, while CT in 98% - while 28.6% had 2 CT scans. No positive findings were noted on the scans. 83.9% patients were admitted, with 15.6% in the ICU. Asthma and Vomiting were associated factors in 30% cases each, while illicit drug use was the cause in 9.6%. Recurrence was noted in 4 patients at a mean of 875 days, while 11 patients returned to the ED within 30 days of discharge for non- critical reasons. Table 1 shows the comparison between patients admitted to ICU, Floor or discharged.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In our experience, SP underwent unnecessary CT scans and admissions at a high rate of utilization with no change in management. Admission and ICU care should depend on associated medical conditions and clinical status - such as asthma exacerbation. Based on these findings, we will implement a clinical pathway with discharge from the ED after brief observation.

Billmire<sup>1</sup>, B. W. Gray<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Indiana University School Of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery/Surgery/Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The prevalence of longer-term survival in patients with trisomy 13 (T13) and 18 (T18) is increasing, thereby increasing the need for consultation for life-maintaining surgical procedures. However, enthusiasm towards any invasive measures on these patients is still tempered due to high rates of early mortality and limited data. The placement of gastrostomy tubes in this population is reviewed here to elucidate timing of placement, its subsequent use, and overall patient outcomes. We predict that gastrostomy tube placement is not associated with high postoperative morbidity or mortality. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All patients with T13 and T18 treated at a free-standing tertiary children&rsquo;s hospital between 2005 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed after obtaining consent-exempt IRB approval. Rates of feeding dysfunction and gastrostomy tube placement were assessed. If a gastrostomy tube was placed, its timing of placement and total time used were reviewed in relation to patient initial hospital discharge and date of last follow-up. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality following gastrostomy tube placement; p&lt; 0.05 was significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Eighty-six patients were included, with 56 (65.1%) surviving to initial discharge and 14 (16.3%) alive at last known follow-up. Sixty-seven (77.9%) had feeding dysfunction, and at last known follow-up, 23 (26.7%) had undergone surgical gastrostomy tube placement. The 30-day postoperative mortality rate following gastrostomy placement was 8.7% (n=2), and 17% (n=4) had related morbidities including surgical site pressure wound and stoma leakage (1), superficial site infection (1), and postoperative respiratory distress (2). The overall mortality rate at any time following gastrostomy tube placement was 47.8% (n=11). Only nine patients (39%) had gastrostomies placed prior to initial discharge, with the median age at gastrostomy placement of 98.0 days [IQR 39.0- 256 days]. Median time of gastrostomy use was 884.0 days [IQR 115.0- 1,855 days]. While there were no differences in 30-day mortality in those with gastrostomy tubes placed after age 3 months compared to those placed earlier (0% vs. 18.2%, p=0.22), those who had gastrostomy tubes placed after age 3 months had higher overall survival rate (72.7% vs. 27.3%, p=0.039) and a trend toward longer days of gastrostomy use (1,348.0 days [IQR 423.5- 3,683 days] vs. 132.0 [IQR 16.0- 1,022 days], [p=0.10]). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Gastrostomy tube placement in patients with T13 and T18 is safe and associated with low surgical morbidity and 30-day mortality. However, it appears that patients may gain the most benefit from gastrostomy placement after 3 months of age.

Becher<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine, Department Of Surgery, New Haven, CT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Inguinal hernias with concomitant ascites pose a clinical dilemma. Clinical studies in this patient population are limited and conflicting. In this study, we examined whether preoperative ascites adversely affects postoperative outcomes in elective and non-elective open inguinal hernia repair.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) is a nationally validated database of patient variables, perioperative metrics, and surgical outcomes recorded prospectively by trained clinical reviewers at participating institutions. NSQIP data were queried for patients who underwent elective or non-elective open inguinal hernia repair as their primary operation from 2005-2019. The inclusion criterion for the study group was the presence of preoperative ascites.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 237,478 open inguinal hernia repair patients were included, 733 with ascites and 236,745 without ascites. Mortality at 30 days for the ascites group was higher than the non-ascites group for both elective (2.5% vs. 0.1%, p&lt;0.001) and non-elective (9.7% vs. 2.1%, p&lt;0.001) cases. Serious complications in the ascites group were also higher than in the non-ascites group for elective cases (9.1% vs. 1.6%, p&lt;0.001) and non-elective cases (41.1% vs. 10.2%, p&lt;0.001). Multivariable regression controlling for sex, age, number of comorbidities, functional status, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class, and preoperative sepsis demonstrated that patients with ascites undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair had increased risk of mortality (Odds Ratio [OR] 6.4; 95% CI 3.6 &ndash; 11.4; p&lt;0.001) over those without ascites; there was no difference between groups in odds of mortality after non-elective cases. Patients with ascites experienced increased risk-adjusted rates of serious complication in both the elective (OR 2.6; 1.9 &ndash; 3.6; p&lt;0.001) and non-elective (OR 2.3; 1.5 &ndash; 3.4; p&lt;0.001) settings. Ascites was additionally found to be an independent predictor of longer hospital length of stay (p&lt;0.001 for both groups) and increased rate of return to the operating room (p&lt;0.001 for elective; p = 0.011 for non-elective), as well as longer elective operative time (p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The presence of ascites is strongly linked to serious complications, return to the operating room, and longer length of stay after both elective and non-elective open inguinal hernia repair. Moreover, ascites is associated with higher 30-day mortality after elective cases. This study suggests that open inguinal hernia repair with concomitant ascites can be fraught with complications, and optimization of ascites prior to surgery may be critical to improving clinical outcomes.

Increasing levels of burnout among trainees and faculty members of all levels is a major problem in academic medicine. Junior faculty members may be at unique risk for burnout and have unique needs and barriers that contribute to attrition, job satisfaction, and overall workplace wellbeing. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Twenty-seven Assistant Professor faculty members at a large, tertiary referral academic medical institution were interviewed. A qualitative analyst with no reporting relationship to faculty conducted the interviews. Five scripted questions targeting faculty wellbeing and institutional barriers to wellbeing were administered, and responses were iteratively coded using grounded theory for common themes between respondents. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Respondents most commonly identified clinical work (26%), research (19%), and teaching (19%), as the best aspects of their job. Just under half (41%) of respondents stated they were not able to devote as much time as they would like to work they enjoyed and found most meaningful. Of this group, 36% cited &ldquo;insufficient help&rdquo; as the root cause, while 27% stated time spent managing Institutional Review Board Requirements was a major contributor. Eighteen percent cited clinical volume and performance benchmarks as a major barrier. An additional 18% cited administrative responsibilities as significant barriers. When asked what the department can do to improve wellbeing, moving meetings to during the workday vs. after hours (11%), establishing a similar value system/metric for all faculty across the board (11%), and providing more opportunities to interact with faculty across the department (11%) were most common. More themes were identified when inquiring about departmental rather than institutional improvements and barriers (53 vs. 34), and significantly more actionable items were identified at the department level. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Junior faculty wellbeing is most often impacted by department-level policies and culture. Qualitative data collection from junior faculty regarding barriers to wellbeing and productivity can provide valuable insights for departments and institutions seeking to make cultural or systemic improvements.

Nathan<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Introduction

The healthcare policy and financing environment since the Affordable Care Act has increased pressure on hospitals to consolidate into larger hospital networks. Annual hospital merger activity has doubled over the last decade, and over two-thirds of US hospitals are now part of a hospital network. Despite these trends, we have a poor understanding of how hospital networks may actualize their potential to improve outcomes and costs. Given the rapid ongoing pace of hospital consolidation, it is critical that we understand how optimizing hospital network design can improve outcomes and costs.

 

 

Methods

Using 100% Medicare claims data, we identified fee-for-service Medicare patients undergoing elective CABG, colectomy, lung resection, and hip/knee replacement from 2010 to 2018. Using the American Hospital Association Annual Survey, we ascertained whether a hospital was part of a network and in which year it joined. We calculated risk-adjusted, price-standardized payments for the surgical episode from admission through 30 days post-discharge to evaluate episode spending. We evaluated the association between outcomes (risk-adjusted serious complications, mortality, and readmission), spending, and network affiliation using adifference-in-differences approach. Aggregate outcomes and spending were evaluated with adjustment for procedure type; stratified analyses for each procedure were also performed.

 

Results 

We identified nearly 3 million operations, with 24% occurring at non-network hospitals and 76% at network hospitals. Mean age was 74 years, and 60% of the cohort was female. Prior to joining a network, average hospital episode spending was $24,263 and increased by $411 (95% CI $116, $707) one year after joining a network. However, by three years after joining a network there was no difference in spending ($167, 95%CI: $-183, $517). Similarly, for outcomes, there was no difference in absolute risk difference for serious complications (0.08, 95% CI: -0.12,0.28) thirty-day readmissions (0.01, 95% CI: -0.34,0.36) or thirty-day mortality (-0.01,95% CI -0.08,0.06) rates after joining a network. In subset analyses, these findings persisted for each procedure individually. 

 

Conclusion 

Proponents of hospital network expansion tout their potential to improve outcomes and reduce health spending, but this study did not show such a benefit for common surgical procedures, at least within the first 3 years after network affiliation. These findings call into question whether networks overall are leveraging their collective volume and experience to optimize care and maximize value. Some individual networks may have implemented successful care optimization strategies&mdash;these must be identified and disseminated if the purported benefits of hospital consolidation are to be realized

Recently, machine learning algorithms utilizing electronic health records have been shown to have promise in improving report timing and accuracy of complications. We compare manual audit supplemented-natural language processing (ms-NLP) methodology against a validated electronic concurrent morbidity and mortality self-reporting platform.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The total number and severity of complications were compared between a multi-institutional validated prospective relational morbidity and mortality database, the Morbidity and Mortality Adverse Event Reporting System (MARS), and ms-NLP of surgical hospitalization discharge summaries among three academic medical centers for 2019. Surgical trainees are responsible for weekly complication data entry into MARS, which integrates multiple clinical assessments, including Clavien Dindo (CD) harm scores. CD scores were assigned to cases with complications identified in discharge summaries using an ms-NLP algorithm and compared to MARS cases. Complications were classified into minor (CD score I-II), or major (CD score III-V) harm. The proportion of cases rated as major harm by the two systems were compared using the McNemar test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 7774 surgical admissions, 987 cases had 1659 complications reported from MARS and 1296 from discharge summaries: 1.68 v. 1.31 complications per case, respectively. Trainee self-reporting via MARS identified 611 (62%) cases whereas ms-NLP identified 670 (68%) cases. Less than one-third of admissions (299 or 30.3%) with complications were identified by both methods (Figure 1A). MARS identified a greater number of complications with severe harm (457, 46.30%) than ms-NLP (371, 37.59%; chi-square= 18.31, df=1, p&lt;.0001) and ms-NLP identified a greater number of minor complications (299, 30.29%) than MARS (154, 15.6%; Figure 1B).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Both a prospectively maintained complication database and ms-NLP review of discharge summaries identify approximately 2/3 of cases with post-operative complications and overlap 1/3 of the time. However, ms-NLP collected data identifies cases sustaining significantly less severe harm. The educational benefit of concurrent reporting and analysis of complication data may be able to be supplemented by ms-NLP data collection, but not replaced by it at this time. Further work is necessary to better leverage artificial intelligence methodologies to enhance a resident&rsquo;s skill in identifying, classifying and critiquing adverse surgical outcomes.

Revascularization surgeries among elderly populations are common and have a high rate of complications requiring re-intervention. In this study, we evaluate the impact of perioperative reoperation in elderly patients undergoing lower extremity bypass (LEB). 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using the Vascular Quality Initiative dataset (2003-2018), we examined 20,130 consecutive infrainguinal LEB performed in elderly patients (&gt;65 years). Cohort frequency matching (3:1) was used to compare patients who underwent reoperation with patients who did not using age, race, indication, urgency, anesthesia type, type of bypass, and frailty variables. Primary outcomes were perioperative mortality, cardiac and respiratory complications, surgical site infection (SSI), length of stay (LOS) and one-year mortality. Multivariable analysis was performed after excluding patients who underwent perioperative amputation, and association was expressed as an adjusted odds ratio (aOR).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In the crude study cohort, 2,343 (11.6%) underwent reoperation following infrainguinal LEBs. Indications for reoperation were amputation (45%), bleeding (11.7%), thrombosis (22.2%), infection (8.9%), and bypass revision (15.8%). In the matched cohorts, reoperation was associated with significantly higher perioperative mortality (5.5% vs. 3.4%), myocardial infarction (6.2% vs. 4.0%), respiratory complications (7.6% vs. 2.7%), and SSI (8.5% vs. 2.6%) (all p&lt; .001). Hospital LOS was significantly longer for reoperation (13.4 &plusmn; 15.0 vs. 6.2 &plusmn; 6.0 days, p&lt;.001). Patients who had reoperation were less likely to discharge home (35.2% vs. 53.6%, p&lt;.001). At one-year, the mortality was significantly higher (17.9% vs 14.2%, p&lt;.001). In multivariable analysis, for the matched cohort, after excluding patients who underwent perioperative amputation, reoperation was independently significantly associated with increased risk of mortality, cardiac complication, respiratory complication, and SSI (p&lt;.001) (Figure). One-year mortality was significantly higher with reoperation (p&lt;.001).

Understanding risk factors associated FTR in the elective AAA population may assist surgeons to prevent operative mortality.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Elective open AAA repairs (2008-2018) were identified from Cerner&rsquo;s HealthFacts&reg; database using ICD-9 and 10 diagnosis and procedure codes. Complications of care were pulmonary failure, pneumonia, myocardial infarction (MI), venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute renal failure (ARF), postoperative bleed, surgical site infection (SSI), and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Multivariate logistic regression models determined the relative contribution of patient and encounter characteristics leading to FTR.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1,761 patients who underwent open repair for non-ruptured AAA, overall mortality was 6.1%; mortality was 3.7% for patients with no major complication. Of patients with 1 or more complications (40.1%) mortality was 9.6%, increasing to 21.5% for patients with &gt;=4 major complications. Characteristics associated with FTR were: age (p &lt;0.0001), female sex (p=0.007), the Charlson index (p&lt;.0001), number of major complications (p&lt;.0001), and several comorbidities. Complications of care most associated with death (Table 1) were: MI, GI bleeding, and pulmonary failure. Adjusted logistic regression demonstrated FTR was associated with: advanced age (OR: 1.19 for 5 years, 95% CI:1.06-1.34); female sex (OR: 1.74; 95% CI:1.12-2.70); congestive heart failure (OR: 1.65, 95% CI:1.00-2.73); peptic ulcer disease (OR: 3.99, 95% CI:1.18-13.5); liver disease (OR: 3.45, 95% CI:1.59-7.52); diabetes with complications (OR: 4.90, 95% CI:1.90-12.6), and the number of complications of care.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Complications of care occurred in 40% of patients after open elective AAA repair. The most lethal major complications of care were MI, GI bleeding, and respiratory failure. FTR was associated with females, comorbidities, and increasing complications of care. To ensure optimized care, adopting a protocol-driven approach for perioperative GI prophylaxis, preoperative MI risk mitigation, and gender-specific assessment tools in the elective AAA setting is needed to reduce these highly associated lethal events.

Malas<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Diego, Vascular Surgery, San Diego, CA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Duke University Medical Center, Vascular Surgery, Durham, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Higher mortality and rates of complications have been associated with interventions conducted over the weekend. While investigations have been performed on this &#39;weekend effect&#39; in carotid endarterectomy, this relationship remains unclear for Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR) and Transfemoral Carotid Artery Stenting (TFCAS). This study aims to evaluate whether weekend procedures are associated with increased mortality and complications for all three carotid revascularization methods.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) was retrospectively queried for all individuals receiving CEA, TCAR, and TFCAS between 2016 and 2021. Chi-square analysis and logistic regression modeling were implemented to analyze differences in mortality and perioperative outcomes as a factor of weekend vs. weekday intervention. Specifically, risk of in-hospital stroke, MI, TIA and mortality were analyzed. The logistic model was adjusted for ethnicity, race, gender, age, symptomatic status, ASA classification, hypertension, diabetes, anesthesia type, statin use and GFR. Secondary analysis was conducted to substratify outcomes by symptomatic status.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of the 198,754 carotid procedures studied, 14,628 were TCAR, 24,866 were TFCAS, and 159,260 were CEA. Of these, 111 TCAR procedures, 920 TFCAS procedures, and 2895 CEA procedures were conducted during the weekend. Patients receiving weekend TCAR demonstrated no significant differences in complications and mortality on univariate analysis. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients undergoing weekend TFCAS demonstrated double the risk of death (OR 1.99, 95% CI:1.38 - 2.88, p&lt;0.001) and 50% increases in stroke and/or death (OR:1.49, 95% CI: 1.08-2.05, p=0.014). Patients receiving weekend CEA experienced 50% increased odds of MI (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.08 - 2.14, p=0.017). (Table 1, Figure 1). Upon stratification, symptomatic status was an effect modifier for TFCAS and CEA as only symptomatic TFCAS and asymptomatic CEA patients demonstrated the negative weekend effect on outcomes. (Table 2, Figure 2).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Weekend carotid revascularization is associated with increased complications and mortality for patients undergoing CEA and TFCAS. These outcomes persist only in symptomatic patients undergoing TFCAS and asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA. Outcomes for TCAR procedures are limited by small sample sizes. Further prospective studies are needed to identify areas of quality improvement for weekend carotid revascularization.

Vogel<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The 5- factor frailty index (mFI-5) is a standardized score that has been demonstrated as a reliable tool in predicting outcomes after surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the mFI-5 as a predictor for hospital utilization, mortality, and readmission after Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The American College of Surgeons&rsquo; National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database (NSQIP) was retrospectively analyzed for patients undergoing elective EVAR between 2015 and 2019. Patients were divided into groups based on mFI-5 scores: mFI1 (0 &ndash; 0.19), mFI2 (0.2 &ndash; 0.39), mFI3 (0.4 &ndash; 0.59), and mFI4 (0.6-1). Outcomes were assessed using univariate analysis (Mann Whitney, chi-square, and t-test) and multivariate logistic regression analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 10,450 non-ruptured aneurysms were performed between 2015 and 2019 were identified from the NSQIP database. Mean age was 73.59 (SD 8.93) years, 2,068 (19.8%) were female and 7,690 (73.6%) were white. 8222 (78.7%) were performed for large diameter with the remaining indications including dissection, symptomatic and embolization/ thrombosis. 30-day mortality was 1.3%. Univariate analysis demonstrated that a mFI-5 score greater than 0.6 was associated with higher rates of prolonged hospital stay more than 7 days (18.8% vs 5.7%, p&lt;0.005, reference mFI-5=0), readmission (12.3% vs 5.9%, p&lt;0.005), 30-day mortality (3.6 % vs 1.2%, p = 0.01), and ICU length of stay more than 3 days (7.2% vs 2.7 p&lt;0.005). Multivariate logistic regression (Table 1) demonstrated female gender, advanced age, indication for surgery, and mFI-5 were all associated with increased 30-day mortality. mFI-5 remained a significant predictor with mFI-5&gt;0.6 having nearly 3 times higher odds for 30-day mortality (OR 2.83, p = 0.003)

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: For patients undergoing elective EVAR, a higher mFI-5 was associated with increased hospital utilization, 30-day mortality, and 30-day readmission. The mFI-5, an easily calculated tool, may assist to identify patients at high risk for inferior outcomes. The mFI-5 may be useful for mortality, hospital utilization, and 30-day readmission for patients undergoing elective EVAR and should be incorporated into preoperative risk stratification.

However, ERP impact on vascular surgery patients, who have a high prevalence of mobility limitations and comorbidities, remains unknown. We sought to examine the association of ERP implementation on LOS in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass (LEB).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed of patients undergoing infrainguinal LEB at a single major vascular center for both elective and non-elective peripheral arterial disease indications; trauma patients were excluded. Patients were stratified into pre-ERP (Jan 2016- April 2018) and ERP (May 2018-July 2021) groups. Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were compared. The primary outcome was LOS (total and postoperative) stratified by indication for surgery (claudication, rest pain and tissue loss). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 387 patients underwent LEB from 2016-2021 (pre-ERP n=188, ERP n=199). Pre-ERP vs. ERP showed similar demographic characteristics including average age (64.2 &plusmn; 9.8 vs. 63.3 &plusmn; 9.9 years, P=0.37), sex (63 vs. 65%, P=0.60) and race (66.5 vs. 55.8%, p=0.03). ERP patients had decreased total and postoperative LOS, with a median total LOS of 5 vs. 6 days (p=0.002) and postoperative LOS of 6 vs. 8 days (p=0.008). Stratified by surgical indication, ERP patients with claudication had significantly decreased postoperative median LOS compared to pre-ERP (3 vs. 5 days, p=0.009), and patients with rest pain had shorter total median LOS (6 vs. 9 days, p=0.025). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: ERP implementation has led to a significant decrease in total and postoperative LOS in patients undergoing LEB at our institution. Studies to evaluate associated cost savings and readmission rates are forthcoming.

Malas<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Diego, Vascular And Endovascular Surgery, San Diego, CA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Penn State University College Of Medicine, Vascular And Endovascular Surgery, Hershey, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Blood pressure fluctuations is a common hemodynamic alteration following carotid artery stenting either with transfemoral (TFCAS) or transcarotid (TCAR) approach and is thought to be related to baroreceptor function alteration due to stent expansion. These complications are worrisome in the high risk patient population referred for CAS. This study aims to evaluate the consequences of hemodynamic instability requiring intravenous vasoactive medication (IVBPmed) for hypotension or hypertension after TFCAS and TCAR on postoperative outcomes and failure to rescue (FTR).


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All patients undergoing CAS in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) database between 2016-2021 were included. We compared outcomes of patients who had hemodynamic instability requiring IVBPmed for hyper- or hypotension versus normotensive patients. Postoperative outcomes were compared using multivariable logistic regression.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 32,348 patients undergoing CAS (18,177 TCAR and 14,171 TFCAS). Of which, 31.1% received IVBPmed for treatment of either postoperative hypertension (13.68 %) or hypotension (17.46%). General anesthesia, preoperative beta blockers, symptomatic status, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease were associated with postoperative hypertension, whereas contralateral occlusion, post stenting balloon angioplasty, female gender, and coronary artery disease were associated with postoperative hypotension(ROC, 0.6). Postoperative hemodynamic instability was associated with increased perioperative mortality both with hypotension (aOR: 2.5, 95%CI (1.96-3.1), P&lt;.001) and hypertension (aOR: 2.4, 95%CI (1.8-3.04), P&lt;.001)(Figure). It was also associated with high risk of postoperative stroke with hypotension (aOR: 2.2, 95%CI (1.8-2.7), P&lt;.001) and hypertension (aOR: 3.2, 95%CI (2.6- 3.96), P&lt;.001). Among patients with major in-hospital complications, hemodynamic instability was associated with more FTR with both hypotension (aOR: 2.3, 95%CI (1.4-3.7), P=.001) and hypertension (aOR: 2.4, 95%CI (1.4-3.99), P=.001).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Postoperative hemodynamic instability requiring IVBPmed for treatment of hypertension or hypotension after CAS is associated with increased risk of postoperative stroke and mortality. It was also predictive of FTR in patients experiencing major complications. This study indicates that hemodynamic instability after CAS is not benign, therefore, these patients necessitates close follow-up and medical management to avoid significant complications. While several factors associated with hemodynamic instability cannot be modified such as age and comorbidities, avoiding post-stent ballooning is modifiable and can decrease the odd of hemodynamic instability.

Although CKD is known to increase the perioperative risk of complications in most operations, the impact of CKD on outcomes following revascularization for ALI has not been examined. The present study examined the association of CKD with in-hospital mortality, amputation, and inpatient costs following revascularization for ALI using a nationally representative cohort.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The 2016-2018 National Inpatient Sample was queried to identify all adult hospitalizations with lower extremity ALI requiring surgical or endovascular interventions. Patients were grouped according to the presence of CKD and its severity: No CKD (NCKD), CKD1-3 (CKD stages 1 through 3), CKD4-5 (CKD stages 4 through 5) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, while secondary outcomes included lower-limb amputation, length of stay (LOS), and hospitalization costs. Multivariable logistic and linear regression was used to evaluate associations between CKD and primary or secondary outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 82,610 patients meeting study criteria, 14.8% had CKD (CKD 1-3: 63.4%, CKD 4-5: 12.1%, ESRD: 24.5%). Compared to NCKD, ESRD patients were, on average, younger (64.6 vs 65.3 years, p&lt;0.001), more commonly female (46.3% vs 41.2%, p=0.006) and of non-White race (51.6% vs 23.0%, p&lt;0.001). Increasing severity of CKD was associated with a stepwise increase in unadjusted mortality rates (4.6% in NCKD to 12.7% in ESRD, p&lt;0.001). Following risk adjustment, ESRD was associated with increased odds of mortality (2.91, 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.15-3.95) and limb amputation (1.64, 95% CI: 1.24-2.17) compared to NCKD patients (Figure 1). ESRD was also associated with increased index LOS (&beta; +4.5 days, 95% CI: 3.6-5.3 days) and hospitalization costs (&beta;+ $13,800, 95% CI: $10,200-17,500) compared to NCKD. Although no association was found between lesser degrees of CKD and mortality or amputation (Figure 1), CKD 4-5 was associated with greater hospitalization costs and LOS than non-CKD patients.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Presence of ESRD was associated with increased odds of mortality following revascularization for lower extremity ALI. Although clinical outcomes were similar among patients without CKD and those with CKD 1-3 or 4-5, CKD 4-5 and ESRD demonstrated prolonged LOS and greater costs. These findings imply that quality improvement efforts should be focused at the ESRD population in order to improve immediate clinical outcomes, although efforts to improve value-based care will likely benefit all CKD groups.

Frailty, often defined as a state of impaired physiologic capacity, has been associated with inferior outcomes following various operations. Owing to the resource intensive nature of frailty assessment tools, several administrative methodologies have been recently employed. We examined the association of frailty, as measured by a coding-based methodology, on in-hospital outcomes of esophagectomy for both benign and malignant indications. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Adults (&ge;18 years) undergoing elective open, laparoscopic, or robotic esophagectomy were identified in the 2010 to 2018 National Readmissions Database. Patient and operative characteristics were ascertained using International Classification of Diseases, 9/10<sup>th</sup> Revision codes. Patients were classified as Frail using the binary Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty indicator. This previously validated indicator identifies 10 clusters of frailty defining diagnoses (i.e. malnutrition, dementia, weight loss, difficulty walking, etc.) which aims to capture frailty in a multidimensional manner. Multivariable regression models were used to characterize the independent associations of frailty with index morality, complications, hospitalization duration (LOS), costs, rates of non-home discharges and 30-day unplanned readmissions.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of an estimated 25,093 hospitalizations for elective esophagectomy, 20.5% were considered Frail. Compared to others, Frail patients were older (64 &plusmn;13 vs 62 &plusmn;13 years, p&lt;0.01), had higher rate of esophageal cancer (55% vs 50% p&lt;0.001) and were more likely to undergo open operations (84% vs 79% p&lt;0.001). After adjustment, frailty was associated with increased odds of mortality (AOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.26-1.89), overall (AOR 1.57, 95% CI 1.44-1.71) as well as respiratory (AOR 1.66, 95% CI 1.52-1.82), infectious (AOR, 1.99 95% CI 1.78-2.23) and thrombotic complications (AOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09-2.19). Frailty was also associated with greater in-hospital length of stay (?:+5.6 days, 95% CI 4.94-6.45) and hospitalization cost (?:+$20,277.37, 95%CI: 17,997-22,556). Frail patients faced higher odds of non-home discharge (AOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.55-1.86) and 30-day unplanned readmissions (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.32) (Figure). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Frailty, as identified by an administrative tool, is associated with significantly worse clinical and financial outcomes following esophagectomy. Standardized assessment of frailty and its inclusion in risk models may better inform shared-decision making prior to choice of operative intervention.

The decision to pursue pancreatic surgery in elderly patients is often complex with limited objective outcome data to guide the process. Previous studies investigating post-operative outcomes after a broad range of major abdominal operations have demonstrated the utility of geriatric-specific variables (GSV): whether the patient lives at home or at a facility, use of a mobility aid, history of falls within the past year, and whether a patient can sign their own consent. This study seeks to examine the association of GSVs with post-operative outcomes in patients selected for elective pancreatic surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients in the ACS NSQIP Geriatric Surgery Research File pilot program who underwent elective pancreatic operations between 2014 and 2018 were included. Patients were stratified into three age groups: 65-74, 75-80, and 81 years or older. Three clinically meaningful comorbid conditions scores were calculated for each patient: presence or absence of at least one GSV, a 5-factor modified frailty index (mFI), and a composite score of the GSV and mFI scores (GSV+mFI). Multivariable logistic regression with adjustment for ACS NSQIP calculated risk was performed to evaluate the associations between these geriatric and frailty variables and the risk of morbidity, mortality, need for re-operation, readmission, and discharge destination.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1266 patients were included in the study: 808 (64%) age 65-74, 302 (24%) age 75-80, 156 (12%) age &ge; 81. A total of 843 (67%) patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy. The operations were performed for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in 628 (50%) of patients. Patients &ge; 81 years were more likely to have at least one GSV present prior to resection (p &lt; 0.001) while the median mFI score was not different between age groups (p = 0.82). Patients &ge; 81 years had a greater likelihood of post-operative morbidity (35% vs 31% vs 47%, by age group, p = 0.004) and discharge to a facility (12% vs 23% vs 48%, by age group, p &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for ACS NSQIP predicted probabilities of morbidity and mortality, patients with the pre-operative presence of at least one GSV were more likely to require a re-operation or to be discharged to a facility (OR 1.81 [95% CI 1.03-3.16] and 3.95 [95% CI 2.91-5.38], respectively). Similarly, the composite GSV+mFI score was also associated with a greater likelihood of re-operation or discharge to a facility (OR 1.87 [95% CI 1.10-3.18] and 3.60 [95% CI 2.68-4.82], respectively).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pre-operative presence of at least one geriatric-specific variable is significantly associated with the need for re-operation and discharge to a skilled facility following elective pancreatic surgery. Geriatric-specific variables should be used in joint pre-operative decision making to optimize post-operative care and address the needs of the elderly patient population.

Morris<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Oklahoma College Of Medicine, Surgery, Oklahoma City, OK, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Enhanced recovery after surgery protocols decrease length of stay (LOS) and morbidity and mortality rates for several major surgeries including hepatectomy. Need for discharge to skilled nursing or rehabilitation centers, however, can increase LOS if not planned and be a source of stress to patients and families if not expected. Estimating risk of discharge to intermediate care facilities (DCIC) would allow earlier involvement of case managers and improve LOS and patient satisfaction by setting realistic expectations. The aim was to use NSQIP dataset to develop a prediction model for DCIC after undergoing hepatectomies for secondary malignancies.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data were obtained from NSQIP PUF 2005-2017 covering liver metastasectomy (n=16,481). Recursive partitioning narrowed a list of potential predictors for inclusion in a multivariable prediction model and identified thresholds for categorization of continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to identify the most parsimonious predictive model using the full sample. To account for overfitting/regression-to-the-mean bias, the model was internally validated using 200 bootstrap samples with replacement. Thereafter, a risk score was derived from the model using the Framingham Study methodology. ROC analysis was used to identify the risk score that maximized sensitivity/specificity and this score was used to define risk groups (low/high). Finally, recursive partitioning was used to identify three categories based on the score (low/medium/high).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The most parsimonious model predicting DCIC (AUC 0.722, 95%CI: 0.705-0.739; Goodness-of-Fit p-value =0.0640) was developed utilizing the full sample. Five independent predictors with their associated risk score weights were identified (See Table 1). The model was internally validated using 200 bootstrap samples with replacement resulting in expected bias-corrected AUC 0.717, 95% CI: 0.698-0.732. The maximum possible score from this model was 17.9 and a score of 5.8 maximized sensitivity(sn) and specificity(sp) [sn=81%,sp=51%) in predicting DCIC. The probability of DCIC was 7.6% for high-risk (score &gt;5.8) 1.8% for low-risk (&lt;5.8). When stratified into three risk groups based on recursive partitioning, a score of &gt;9.5 identified the highest risk (12.8%), &gt;4.3 medium-risk (6.1%) and &lt;4.3 lowest risk (1.5%).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Determining the risk of DCIC benefits shared decision making and patient care. This evidence can be used by case managers to enhance discharge planning for patients undergoing liver metastasectomy, thereby expediting the process. Unsurprisingly, age &gt;60 contributed the most weight to the score, but the use of additional variables in three groups allowed further discrimination between patients.

As multimodality treatments improve across the spectrum of pancreas cancer care, the effect of PV resection on survival duration deserves contemporary reevaluation. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We completed a retrospective analysis of data derived from a prospective, institutional pancreas cancer database of patients with localized disease treated with neoadjuvant therapy and pancreatectomy between January 2009 and July 2020. Patient demographics, clinical stage, peri-operative data and survival were analyzed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

Of 532 total patients, 158 (30%) required vein resection (VR) during pancreatectomy. Patients who required VR had more advanced radiographic stage at diagnosis (BRPC 60% vs. 40%, LAPC 23% vs. 15% p&lt;0.001), higher CA19-9 at diagnosis (median 388 U/ml, IQR 1013m vs 172 U/ml, IQR 476 p=0.02), larger tumor size (median 3 cm IQR 1.5 vs 2.5 cm, IQR 2; p&lt;0.001), worse Ryan Score (partial or no response on surgical pathology, 84% vs. 74%, p=0.01), a higher rate of perineural invasion (71% vs. 61%, p=0.02) and an increased percent of lympho-vascular invasion (44% vs 20%, p&lt;0.01).

In an adjusted multivariable COX proportional hazards analysis, VR was not associated with increased risk of death in patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (HR:1.31, 95% CI:0.77-2.22, p=0.33 and HR:1.23, 95% CI:0.87-1.73, p=0.25) respectively. In patients with locally advanced disease, VR was associated with an increased risk of death (HR:2.85, 95% CI:1.48-5.49, p=0.002) and shorter median survival (32.9 months[mo] vs 44.8 mo, p=0.002). However, in patients with locally advanced disease, time from diagnosis to progression was similar (VR 23.1 mo vs No VR:24.6 mo p=0.63) and there was no difference in sites of recurrence between the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The need for VR during pancreatectomy (after neoadjuvant therapy) did not influence survival duration except in patients with locally advanced disease. Optimal duration of neoadjuvant therapy and the role for surgery in this subset of patients with localized pancreatic cancer remains an area of active investigation.

Existing literature has consistently found that lower income areas tend to have higher obesity rates given the low access to fresh produce and high number of fast food restaurants (&ldquo;food deserts&rdquo;). As defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), a food desert is a US census tract with a poverty rate of 20% or greater (low income), where 33% of the population live more than a mile away (low access) from a supermarket or grocery store and ultimately healthy food.

We will use the emerging findings surrounding food deserts to expound on what seems to be missing from the literature: the relationship between food deserts, bariatric surgery/obesity-related procedures, and thus, medical costs. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The 2018 California Inpatient Database was queried for all inpatient admissions of patients &ge; 18 years old. Food deserts were identified using the USDA Food Access Research Atlas, and matched to patients via home address zip codes. Data on BMI and obesity-related procedures were obtained through ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes. Patients living in food deserts (FD) were compared to those living in non-food deserts (non-FD). Patients with BMI&ge;30 (obese) were compared to those with BMI &lt;30, and multivariable regression was used to identify predictors of obesity. In patients with BMI&ge;40 (morbidly obese), patients who received bariatric surgery were compared to those who did not, and multivariable regression was used to identify predictors of bariatric surgery.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 3,696,877 admissions were identified, of which 321,732 (8.7%) lived in food deserts. When comparing FD to non-FD patients, FD were more likely to: be Hispanic (40.1% vs 31.5%, p&lt;.01), live in low-income neighborhoods (lowest quartile, 69.5% vs 25.9%, p&lt;.01), be insured with Medicaid (41.9% vs 29.6%, p&lt;.01), have higher rates of obesity (14.2% vs 12.7%, p&lt;.01) and less likely to be Asian (3.5% vs 10.8%, p&lt;.01). When comparing patients with obesity to those without, patients with obesity were more likely to be female (61.5% vs 54.7% p&lt;.01) and live in food deserts (9.7% vs 8.6%, p&lt;.01). On multivariable regression, factors associated with higher odds of obesity include older age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02-1.02), female sex (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.33-1.35), non-White race (Black, OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.34-1.37; Hispanic, OR 1.15, 95%CI 1.14-1.16; Native American, OR 1.56, 95%CI 1.49-1.64), and food deserts (OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.12-1.15). Factors associated with higher odds of bariatric surgery include female sex (OR 1.63, 95%CI 1.55-1.71), private insurance (OR 5.05, 95%CI 4.67-5.45), self-pay (OR 1.74, 95%CI 1.39-2.17), and food deserts (OR 1.13, 95%CI 1.05-1.23).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Food deserts are associated with higher rates of obesity and bariatric surgery, as well as multiple socioeconomic factors such as lower median household income, Medicaid insurance, and racial barriers affecting Hispanic, Black, and Native American races/ethnicities.

Prophylactic ENOX dosing in severe obesity is often determined based on body weight or a body mass index (BMI) guided dosing regimen (BMI 30-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>: 40mg QD; BMI 40-50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>: 40mg BID; BMI &gt;50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>: 60mg BID). However, given the variability in patient physiology, there is concern whether weight and BMI-guided dosing consistently achieves prophylactic targets in obese patients. Existing studies in trauma patients suggest that estimated blood volume (EBV) is a better metric than BMI to achieve target peak anti-Xa levels (0.2-0.5 IU/mL).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This retrospective study included patients from Jan 2015-May 2021 who underwent primary or revisional bariatric surgery at a tertiary academic medical center. All included patients had an anti-Xa level drawn 2.5-6 hours after &ge; 3 doses of BMI-based prophylactic ENOX. Patients electronic medical records were matched to the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program for preoperative demographics and postoperative complications. The primary outcome was percentage of patients who achieved a target anti-Xa level with BMI-guided ENOX dosing. Secondary outcomes were prevalence of VTE and bleeding events within 30 days post-operatively, and determining if EBV had a stronger correlation with achieving target anti-Xa levels than BMI. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.0.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 137 patients were included in this study. Mean BMI was 59.1 &plusmn; 10.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, mean age was 43.9 &plusmn; 13.3 years and 110 patients (80.3%) were female. Mean anti-Xa level was 0.36 IU/mL. Target anti-Xa levels were achieved in 116 patients (84.7%), 14 (10.2%) were above target and 7 (5.1%) were below target. Patients above target anti-Xa levels were 7.3 cm shorter than those within target range (167.1 vs 159.8 cm, p=0.002). Five patients (3.6%) had bleeding events; no thromboembolisms occurred. Anti-Xa levels correlated more strongly with ENOX dose per EBV than dose per BMI (Rho=0.54 vs Rho=0.33). When comparing patients&rsquo; BMI-guided dose with the dose recommended under theoretical EBV guidelines, 112 patients (82%) would receive the same dose and 21 (15%) would receive a lower dose (n=20 for 40mg BID instead of 60mg BID; n=1 for 30mg BID instead of 40mg BID). Mean anti-Xa was 0.53 IU/mL for the theoretically over-dosed patients based on EBV guidelines.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Target anti-Xa levels were achieved in 85% of bariatric surgery patients under the existing BMI-guided prophylactic ENOX dosing regimen. Patients with above target anti-Xa levels were significantly shorter, suggesting a risk of overdosing ENOX in shorter, obese patients. EBV-based dosing guidelines may better account for patient height and is supported by a greater correlation with anti-Xa levels with dosing based on EBV than BMI.

Major pathologic response (MPR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients undergoing resection is associated with improved survival. Populations at risk for worse MPR following NAC have not been clearly defined. In metastatic PDAC, African-American (AA) patients receiving chemotherapy demonstrate worse cancer-specific survival compared with their non-AA counterparts. Using the Central Pancreatic Consortium dataset, we sought to determine if similar racial disparities exist in MPR rates following modern NAC in PDAC patients undergoing resection.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Patients with potentially operable PDAC receiving at least 2 cycles of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel &plusmn;radiation followed by pancreatectomy (2010-2019) at 7 centers were reviewed. MPR was defined according to the College of American Pathologists consensus as pathologic complete response (pCR) or near-pCR. Multivariable models examined the association of race with MPR. Cox regression evaluated the association between race and overall survival (OS).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 486 patients (median age 64, 78% borderline resectable/locally advanced) who underwent resection following NAC (mFOLFIRINOX 56%, gemcitabine/abraxane 25%, other 19%), 67 (13.8%) patients were AA while 419 were non-AA. While there were no significant differences in age, ECOG performance status, duration of NAC received, and chemotherapy regimens between AA and non-AA cohorts, both the CA19-9 at diagnosis (median 67 vs. 204 U/mL; P=0.003) as well as the absolute decline in CA 19-9 following NAC (median -31.9 vs. -139.2 U/mL; P=0.01) was significantly lower in AA compared with non-AA patients. Importantly, while the MPR in the overall cohort was 24.1%, AA patients had significantly reduced rates of MPR compared to non-AA patients (13.4% vs. 25.8% respectively; P=0.039). Moreover, AA race was independently associated with worse MPR on multivariable logistic regression (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10-0.69; P=0.007) while controlling for duration of NAC, CA 19-9 decline, body mass index, age, and ECOG status. The distribution of MPR rates between mFOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine/abraxane recipients did not differ significantly between AA and non-AA patients (P=0.7). At a median follow-up of 23.2 (range: 4-116) months, the median OS of this cohort was 29.6 months. In this selected cohort of completely resected patients receiving NAC, there was no statistically significant difference in OS between AA and non-AA cohorts (median 30.5 vs. 29.5 months; P=0.8).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The racial disparity associated with reduced rates of MPR do not translate into meaningful differences in survival between AA and non-AA PDAC patients receiving NAC. Whether these differences in MPR are related to biologic mechanisms of chemoresistance or non-biologic factors (e.g., socioeconomic determinants of health) warrant further investigation.

The aim was to compare outcomes among patients admitted through trauma pathway (TP) versus medical pathway (MP).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Our IRB approved retrospective study included 2,091 patients with proximal HF (intertrochanteric, femoral neck or head) admitted to an urban hospital between 2016-2021. There were 66 patients who went through TP of a level 1 trauma center and 2,025 admitted through MP. To ensure comparability between groups, 66 of 2,025 MP patients were propensity score matched to 66 TP patients by: age, sex, HF type, HF surgery, and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score. Analyzed variables included: admission day of the week, mechanism of injury (MOI), comorbidities, pre-injury anticoagulation use, number of consultations and diagnostic procedures, time to and length of HF surgery, intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay (ICULOS, HLOS), discharge disposition, and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Mean age was 75 y.o. in both groups. Majority of patients in TP and MP (71% vs 74%) were geriatric (&ge; 65 y.o.) females (62% for both) with intertrochanteric HF (53% vs 62%), all p&gt;0.4. Falls were the main MOI in both groups (77% vs 97%, p=0.001). Day of the week admission was not significantly different, p=0.4. There were no significant differences in pre-surgery anticoagulation use (49% vs 41%, p=0.4). Incidence of comorbidities was equal (94% for both) with cardiac comorbidities being dominant in both groups (71% vs 73%, p&gt;0.4). Mean number of pre-operative consultations was similar for TP and MP, p=0.2 [Figure 1]. Most common consultation was cardiology for both (44% and 36%, p=0.4), followed by neurology in TP (18%) and internal medicine in MP (8%). Mean ASA score was 2.8 and 2.7 for TP and MP (p=0.5). Time to surgery was not statistically different (22.7 vs 23.0 hours, p=0.9) but HF surgery took significantly longer for TP (59 vs 41 minutes, p&lt;0.001) due to additional fractures fixed under the same anesthesia in 39% of TP. Open Reduction Internal Fixation was the most common HF surgery in TP and MP (68% vs 71%, p=0.7). ICULOS and HLOS were not statiscally different (4.5 vs 8.0 days and 6.3 vs 6.0 days, both p=0.7). Discharge disposition was similar in both groups. Mortality rates were low and not statistically different (3% vs 0%, p=0.2).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There were no notable differences in management and outcomes between patients with proximal HF who underwent HF surgery but were admitted through two different pathways: trauma versus medicine. With no delay to surgery and low rates of mortality, trauma resources could be saved and admission through singular medical pathway is recommended.

SIPA is a binary value, however, and the relationship between increasing values above SIPA cutoffs and the need for an intervention is unknown. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective chart review of children (ages 1-18 years) with any BSOI admitted to a Level 1 pediatric trauma center between 2009 and 2020 was performed. Blood transfusion was defined as any blood transfusion within 24 hours of patient arrival and operation was defined as any abdominal operation for hemorrhage control. Descriptive statistics were reported as mean and median for numeric variables and as frequency (percent) for categorical variables. Probabilities of receiving a blood transfusion or operative intervention were calculated at different shock index (SI) increments of 0.1.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 495 patients included in analysis. The median age was 10.0 years and the median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 14.0. Of all patients, 48.9% (242) presented with an elevated SIPA, of which 19.8% (98) received blood and 6.7% (33) underwent laparotomy. The proportion of patients with an isolated BSOI was 48.5% (240). Regardless of age, as SIPA values increased so too did the probability of receiving a blood transfusion [odds ratio 1.67 (95% CI 1.49, 1.90) for each 0.1 unit increase, p&lt;0.001]. When values were above 1.2, the probability of receiving blood exceeded 50%, and for values above 1.7, the probability was 100%, for all age groups (Fig. 1). A similar trend was seen initially for predicting failure of non-operative management, but beyond a threshold, values were not associated with a higher probability of an operation.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Discreet values above age-related SIPA cutoffs may help guide the decision to transfuse, because higher values are associated with higher probabilities of blood transfusion. These findings further validate that children have age adjusted shock index cutoffs that differ from adults. Higher SIPA values above age-specific norms may help practitioners more quickly identify those children who will require a more aggressive resuscitation strategy.

The evaluation and treatment of trauma patients requires significant hospital resources. Across institutions, numerous protocols exist to triage the injured patient and determine the level of care they may require. Nursing shortages and the loss of experienced nursing staff have resulted in novel strategies to facilitate triage of the injured patient, including utilization of specialized trauma nurses for initial screening of the trauma patient. This study seeks to describe an institutional trauma screening procedure. We hypothesized that trauma nurse screening is a safe and effective tool in the triage of the injured patient.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The study was conducted at a level I trauma center where patients are assessed by a trauma nurse clinician utilizing trauma triage processes to determine suitability for trauma team activation. If the patient does not meet activation criteria, they are sent to the main Emergency Department for evaluation and treatment. Patients may later be activated by the emergency physician if necessary. Retrospective review of data from January 2021 to June 2021 was performed. Each month, trauma nurse clinicians collected and compiled data regarding trauma nurse screenings, the number of trauma activations versus trauma &ldquo;rule-outs,&rdquo; and the injury severity score (ISS) for those patients who were activated. The primary variables of interest were number of activations after an initial rule-out, the mechanism of injury, ISS, and ultimate disposition (hospital discharge versus admission to ward, step-down unit, or intensive care unit (ICU)).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Over the six-month study period, there were a total of 1874 trauma screenings. Of these, 1449 patients did not meet trauma activation criteria as determined by the trauma nurse clinician (77%). Only 41 (2.8%) of those patients initially ruled out were later activated by the emergency physician and admitted for treatment of injuries. The average ISS score of all activated patients was 9 +/- 6. Of these patients, 36 had an ISS of 15 or less (88%), 4 had an ISS between 16 and 25 (10%), and only one patient had an ISS of greater than 25. The majority of these patients (27) were admitted to ward, while five went to step-down units and five required intensive care unit admission. Four (10%) patients required operative intervention for their injuries.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 

These results suggest that nursing screening protocols can be a safe and effective tool for triage of trauma patients; however, the trauma nurse screening process has placed an additional workload burden on current staffing during an already trying time.

Billiar<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Pittsburgh, Surgery, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Severe injury is known to cause a systemic cytokine storm that is associated with adverse outcomes. However, a comprehensive assessment of the time-dependent changes in circulating levels of the full spectrum of protein immune mediators and soluble immune mediator receptors in severely injured trauma patients remains uncharacterized. To address this knowledge gap, we defined the temporal and outcome-based patterns of 187 known immune mediators and soluble receptors in the circulation of severely injured patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Plasma multiplexed proteomics (adaptamer-based assay, SomaLogic, Inc.) were performed on plasma samples drawn at three timepoints (0 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours after injury) from 150 trauma patients; a representative subset from the PAMPer trial (NEJM, Sperry et al. 2018). We identified 123 known immune mediators and 64 soluble immune mediator receptors from the measurement of 7000 circulating proteins. Protein levels were normalized across all samples. Patients were categorized into outcome groups including Early Non-Survivors (died within 72 hours; ENS; n=38), Non-Resolvers (died after 72 hours or required more than 7 days of intensive care; NR; n=78), and Resolvers (survivors that required less than 7 days of intensive care; R; n=34). One-way ANOVA and t-tests were used to assess significant differences (defined as a P-value &lt;0.01). 

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Circulating mean concentration of most immune mediators and soluble receptors were significantly different across outcome groups at admission (time 0h). While ENS and NR patients had similar immune mediator profiles, comparisons between NR or ENS and R patients revealed significant elevations in 19/32 chemokines, 24/33 interferon (IFN) family members, 33/43 interleukins (IL), 12/15 TNF superfamily members, 3/4 IFN receptors, 13/37 IL receptors, and 16/23 TNF receptor superfamily members. Notably, a selective significant elevation in 8 TNF superfamily members and 17 TNF receptor superfamily members in NR compared to R was observed at 24h. At 72h, the pattern shifted to reveal selective significant increases in 11 chemokines (primarily C-C family members) in NR vs R. It is notable that many of the mediators shown to be elevated in NR patients have not been previously studied in human trauma (e.g., CCL13, CCL21, CCL23, CCL24, CCL27)


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We describe an early massive and near indiscriminate release of circulating protein mediators and their receptors in trauma patients that either die or slowly resolve from critical illness. Further, we identify selective increases in levels of TNF superfamily members at 24h and C-C chemokines at 72h in patients that resolve slowly or are at risk for death. These novel observations provide a temporal landscape of circulating immune mediators/receptors following severe injury and provides a roadmap for further study of the biological roles of many uncharacterized mediators in trauma.

Tzeng<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department Of Surgical Oncology, Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: A reproducible guideline for standardizing discharge opioid prescription volumes is to base it off the actual opioid use in the last 24 hours before discharge. A natural concern of using this calculation is the risk of &ldquo;rebound refills&rdquo; for patients after a short inpatient stay whose true analgesic needs may not have declared by the time of discharge. We therefore sought to compare refill rates and volumes for patients discharged by postoperative day (POD) 2-3, 4-7, and 8+, to address this concern.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In a prospective cohort study, faculty volunteered to participate in either a 5x-multiplier or usual care (UC) study arm for their patients undergoing inpatient (&ge;48hr stay) surgery (9/2019-12/2019). The 5x-multiplier for discharge prescriptions is 5-times the patient&rsquo;s last 24-hour opioid use (by oral morphine equivalents, OME). Cohorts were compared by POD of discharge: POD 2-3 (&ldquo;SHORT&rdquo;), POD 4-7 (&ldquo;INTERMEDIATE&rdquo;), and POD 8+ (&ldquo;LONG&rdquo;) based on historical medians. The primary endpoint was 30-day refill rates after discharge. Secondary endpoints include 30-day refill volumes and inpatient opioid weaning and discharge metrics. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 22 faculty, there were 409 patients included. When stratified by LOS, 37.6% (154) were discharged SHORT, 43.0% (176) INTERMEDIATE, and 19.3% (79) LONG. More SHORT stay patients underwent MIS (53.2% vs. 21.6% INTERMEDIATE, 19.0% LONG; p&lt;0.001). LONG stay patients had higher use of epidurals (34.2% vs. 3.2% SHORT, 19.3% INTERMEDIATE; p&lt;0.001), required reoperations (7.6% vs. 0.0% SHORT, 2.3% INTERMEDIATE; p=0.011), had major complications (21.5% vs. 2.6% SHORT, 4.5% INTERMEDIATE; p&lt;0.001), and were readmitted (19.0% vs. 7.8% SHORT, 8.0% INTERMEDIATE; p=0.013). SHORT stay patients had a higher median last 24-hour OME (10mg vs. 5mg INTERMEDIATE, 5mg LONG; p=0.122), but the lowest median discharge OME (55mg vs. 75mg INTERMEDIATE, 100mg LONG; p=0.021). Patients with SHORT stays did not have higher refill rates (11.7% vs. 18.2% INTERMEDIATE, 19.0% LONG; p=0.193) or higher median refill OME (150mg vs. 300mg INTERMEDAITE, 339mg LONG; p=0.34) (Figure 1). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite concern for potential increased refills, discharges by POD 2-3 were not associated with &ldquo;rebound refill&rdquo; requests or volumes. Despite having more time to wean their opioids while inpatient, INTERMEDIATE and LONG stay patients were discharged with larger prescriptions. Patient-centered 5x-multiplier standardization of discharge opioid prescriptions is feasible in all inpatient surgery patients, even those discharged following a short inpatient stay.

Many major academic cancer centers engage in regular multidisciplinary tumor board meetings to present challenging patient cases and to determine the optimal multidisciplinary approach to complex cancer care. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, many institutions changed the format of these tumor board meetings from in-person to virtual. The aim of this study was to determine if the change to a virtual meeting format had an impact on attendance and cases presented.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Tumor board records were analyzed to obtain attendance and case presentation information in nine separate weekly disease site tumor boards within the Department of Surgical Oncology at an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center affiliated with multiple community partner institutions. Twelve months of in-person tumor board data pre-pandemic was compared to twelve months of virtual tumor board data post-pandemic to assess for difference in attendance and case presentation patterns.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Six separate weekly tumor board meetings at the beginning of the study (breast, gastrointestinal, gynecology, lung, melanoma, and urology) were expanded to nine meetings on the virtual platform (endocrine, liver, and pancreas added) within the Department of Surgical Oncology. Overall attendance increased by 46% on the virtual platform as compared to in-person meetings (4,030 unique virtual attendances versus 2,753 in-person over the respective 12-month periods, p&lt;0.001). Increased attendance was present across all specialties on the virtual platform (gastroenterology 859%, radiation oncology 141%, medical oncology 119%, pathology 46%, radiology 33%, surgery 18%). Additionally, the number of patient cases discussed increased from 2,075 in-person to 2,656 on the virtual platform (a 28% increase, p&lt;0.001). Official attendance records held on the main campus did not capture much of the community affiliate participation. However, it was recognized by tumor board leaders and administrative staff that the participation by way of both attendance and case presentations from affiliate sites increased significantly after moving tumor board meetings to the virtual platform.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
A significant increase was seen in overall tumor board attendance and in the numbers of case presentations per meeting, requiring the addition of three additional separate weekly meetings. Further, in a major cancer center with multiple remote community affiliates, virtual tumor boards may encourage increased participation from remote sites with the benefit of obtaining expert specialist advice as compared to geographically challenging in-person meetings. We recommend continuing tumor board with at least some level of virtual component.

Endotheliopathy, described by glycocalyx damage and endothelial cell dysfunction, occurs early after trauma and directly contributes to end-organ injury. Targeted therapies that minimize endotheliopathy may improve outcomes related to organ failure after trauma. However, the effects of injury mechanism on endotheliopathy and subsequent end-organ injury have not been directly evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine associations between injury mechanism, endotheliopathy, and acute kidney (AKI) injury in trauma subjects with hemorrhagic shock.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a secondary analysis of prospectively collected clinical and biomarker data from the Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) randomized controlled trial. Subjects were stratified into groups based on blunt or penetrating injury and shock severity as defined by admission base deficit (BD; mild: BD&gt;-5, moderate: -10
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Differences in biomarker levels between blunt and penetrating injuries were dependent on shock severity. For subjects in severe shock, blunt injury resulted in significantly greater levels of Sdc-1 early after arrival (0-6 hours), increased Ang-2 at 24 hours, and increased sTM at later time points (12-72 hours) when compared to subjects with penetrating injury in severe shock. Admission Sdc-1, Ang-2 and sTM levels were greater in subjects with AKI compared to non-AKI subjects after blunt injury; however, no differences in admission biomarkers were observed between AKI and non-AKI subjects after penetrating injury. For both injury mechanisms, 6- and 24-hour Sdc1, 24-hour Ang-2, and 24-hour sTM levels were greater in subjects with AKI. After adjusting for admission BD, Sdc-1 and sTM levels at admission were associated with early AKI in subjects with blunt injuries, whereas only shock severity was associated with early AKI following penetrating injury.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These findings highlight differences in endotheliopathy between blunt and penetrating injuries that may impact end-organ injury. Ultimately, understanding these mechanisms may lead to improvements in the clinical management of trauma patients through interventions that target the unique pathologic sequelae of blunt and penetrating injuries.

Magnotti<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Department Of Surgery, Memphis, TN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Retained hemothorax (RH) remains a common problem after thoracic trauma with associated morbidity and prolonged hospitalizations. While multiple studies have shown improvement in length of stay (LOS) and pulmonary complications with thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), the optimal time to VATS to reduce these complications is unknown. The goal of this study was to examine the impact of time to VATS on pulmonary morbidity using a large, national dataset.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients undergoing VATS for RH within the first 14 days post-injury were identified from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) database over 5 years, ending in 2016. Age, gender, mechanism, severity of injury (admission ISS and GCS), severity of shock (admission SBP and HR), time to VATS, pulmonary morbidity (repeat VATS, tracheostomy, pneumonia, unplanned intubation, ARDS, pulmonary embolism) and mortality were recorded. Patients were then stratified by time to VATS post-injury and compared: &le; 7days (EARLY) and 8-14 days (LATE). Multivariable logistic regression (MLR) analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of pulmonary morbidity. Youden&rsquo;s index was then used to identify the optimal time to VATS.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 3546 patients were identified. Of these, 2355 (66%) were blunt. The majority were male (81%) with a median age and ISS of 46 and 16, respectively. The median time to VATS was 134 hours. Both EARLY and LATE groups were clinically similar with regards to age, gender, severity of shock, and ISS. However, there was significantly reduced pulmonary morbidity (15 vs 29%, p&lt;0.0001), ICU LOS (3 vs 6 days, p&lt;0.0001), ventilator days (0 vs 1 day, p&lt;0.0001) and hospital LOS (11 vs 19 days, p&lt;0.0001) in the EARLY group. The optimal time to VATS was determined to be 93.6 hours. Both pulmonary morbidity (13 vs 17%, p=0.004) and hospital LOS (9 vs 12 days, p&lt;0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients undergoing VATS prior to 93.6 hours. After adjusting for age, mechanism, severity of shock and injury and time to VATS, MLR identified VATS during the first 7 days as the only modifiable risk factor significantly associated with reduced pulmonary morbidity (OR 0.52; 95%CI 0.43-0.63, p&lt;0.0001). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: VATS within the first week of admission results in fewer pulmonary complications and shorter hospital LOS. In fact, the optimal time to VATS was identified as 3.9 days and was the only modifiable risk factor associated with decreased pulmonary morbidity. Thus, for patients with RH, VATS should be performed within the first 4 days post-injury to reduce both morbidity and LOS.

Okereke<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch, Surgery, Galveston, TX, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Stanford University, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Palo Alto, CA, USA&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>The Johns Hopkins University School Of Medicine, Surgery, Baltimore, MD, USA&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>Henry Ford Health System, Thoracic Surgery, Detroit, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Integrated cardiothoracic surgery residencies were begun in 2006 to meet the needs of future cardiothoracic surgeons in fewer years. As more attention has been given to racial and gender disparities in surgical education, our goal was to examine the trends in diversity among entering integrated cardiothoracic residents over time.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All integrated cardiothoracic programs which had accepted residents through 2020 were included. A list of all residents was collected through online websites and direct contact with institutions. Gender, race and year of entry were recorded.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 2006 through 2020, 321 residents were accepted into integrated cardiothoracic training programs at 27 institutions. Male residents comprised 72 percent (232/321) of the cohort. The racial distribution was 66.4 percent Caucasian (213/321), 26.2 percent Asian (84/321), 5.3 percent Hispanic (17/321) and 2.2 percent African American (7/321). 

As the number of integrated programs increased, diversity increased. From 2016&mdash;2020 there was a significant increase in both the percentage of female (p = 0.04) and non-Caucasian (p &lt; 0.01) integrated cardiothoracic residents compared to 2006&mdash;2015 (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Gender and racial diversity has improved over time in integrated cardiothoracic residencies, but Hispanics and African Americans are still considerably underrepresented in these training programs. Institutions should strive to recruit medical students from underrepresented backgrounds and increase their focus on gender diversity. Targeting medical students during their first two years may help to improve the level of diversity in integrated cardiothoracic residencies.

Within simulation training, chest tube insertion remains a challenge as one of the main pitfalls of insertion is a controlled pleural entry. This study evaluates a novel training model with real-time pressure monitoring to enhance simulation in surgical trainees.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This proprietary training model comprised of a modified Kelly clamp device with three force sensors at the index finger (sensor 1) and two finger loops (sensors 2 and 3), and a manikin with a replaceable chest wall pad. Standard force values (Newtons &quot;N&#39;) were obtained by experts; expert data revealed that 3-5 seconds was an acceptable time range to complete the chest tube insertion. Participant level ranged from PGY-1 to PGY-6. Each individual was provided an introduction to the procedure and chest tube trainer. Force (newtons) and time (milliseconds) measurements were obtained from entry through dermis to pleural space puncture. A significant pressure drop suggested puncturing through the chest wall (completion of the procedure).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Force data was captured during each phase of the procedure&mdash;linear, plateau, and drop. Linear phase (~3,000ms) was from start of procedure to point of maximum force (&lt; 30N). Plateau phase was from maximum force to just before a drop in pressure. Drop phase was a drop in pressure by 5+ Newtons in a span of 150 ms signaling completion of procedure. All participants were able to complete the task successfully. Force for pleural entry ranged from 17N to 30N; time to pleural entry ranged from 7,500 to 15,000ms. There was variability in use of all three sensors. All participants used the index sensor, however there was variability in the use of the loops sensors depending on the handedness of the participant. Left-handed users relied more on sensors 1 and 3 while right-handed users relied more on sensors 1 and 2. Given this variability, only force measurements from sensor 1 were utilized for assessment. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While this training modality utilized only one sensor and focused specifically on controlled pleural entry aspect of thoracostomy, this novel force-sensing chest tube trainer with continuous pressuring monitoring has a wide range of applications in simulation-based training of emergency surgical tasks. Next steps include incorporating simultaneous audio-visual feedback to help improve accuracy and effciency.

Bonne<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Hospital, Trauma And Critical Care, Newark, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
YouTube has become a main resource used by patients for self education on medicine. It is important for surgeons to understand the quality and reliability of these videos that may be viewed before or after acute care procedures. Our goal is to evaluate the quality and reliability of medical information on YouTube, pertaining to several common acute care procedures on a trauma surgery service.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Four terms were investigated for educational quality on YouTube. Videos were categorized by view count and medical credentials of content creators. The top 20 videos for each term, sorted by relevance, were evaluated using DISCERN criteria, a question set externally validated to assess the quality of information regarding health treatment choices. Overall scores closer to 5 indicate higher quality information. Summed scores between 15-26 are considered very poor, 27-38 as poor, 39-50 as fair, 51-62 as very good, and 63-75 as excellent. The first key term (&ldquo;Wound Care&rdquo;) was independently evaluated using DISCERN criteria by each researcher, and compared for internal validity to resolve any conflicts in scoring method. Search terms included &ldquo;Wound Care&rdquo;, &ldquo;Skin Grafting&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tracheostomy&rdquo;, and &ldquo;PEG tube placement&rdquo;.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In total 80 videos were evaluated. The top 20 videos for &ldquo;tracheostomy&rdquo; had 2,743,838 combined views. Of these videos, 10 were uploaded by academic institutions/hospitals, 8 were from online educational resource companies, and 2 were informational videos on medical products. The overall DISCERN score (DS) was 2.33 including an average bias score (BS) of 2.75 and summed score of 35.05. The top 20 videos for &ldquo;Wound Care&rdquo; had 2,853,967 views in total. Of these videos, 14 were authored by medical professionals, 3 by academic institutions, and 3 by private healthcare education companies. The top 20 videos for &ldquo;Skin Grafting&rdquo; had 2,743,838 combined total views. Of these videos, 11 were authored by medical professionals, 3 by educational media companies, 4 hospitals, 1 patient perspective, and 1 advertisement. The average DS was 2.65 and BS 3.3, with a summed score of 40.7. The average DS was 2.01, BS of 1.8, and summed score of 29.4. The top 20 videos for &ldquo;PEG tube placement&rdquo; had 1,789,964 views in total. Of these videos, 8 were uploaded by academic/healthcare institutions, 5 were authored by medical professionals (MD/DO), and 3 were informational videos about medical products. The average DS for these videos was 2.64, including BS of 2.6 and summed score of 39.6

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: 

Youtube videos surrounding acute care procedures should be viewed cautiously in patient education, despite wide availability. The videos in this study show high levels of bias and low DISCERN scores. Healthcare providers should strive to upload educational materials that are not only easy to understand, but evidence based and unbiased.

Coakley<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Mount Sinai School Of Medicine, Surgery, New York, NY, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Mount Sinai School Of Medicine, New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: In recent years, mass shootings have become a worsening problem in the US. These events, defined as shootings injuring at least four people, excluding the shooter, claim the lives of more than 300 people annually in the US. Despite wide variations in the rates of mass shootings in US states, little is known about which factors are associated with these catastrophic events. We set out to determine if several social determinants of health or surrogate markers for the number of guns in circulation or relative strictness of gun control laws was associated with increased or decreased risks of being injured or killed in a mass shooting.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Mass shooting events from 2014-2019 were collected from the Gun Violence Archive&#39;s online database. Injury and mortality data was then aggregated by state. State-level data regarding population, poverty, unemployment, educational attainment and number of ATF registered weapons were collected from publically-available US governmental databases. Giffords Law Center rankings were used to assess the relative strictness of each state&rsquo;s gun laws. State-level adult gun ownership data was obtained from a 2014 national survey. Bivariate analyses were conducted, comparing various social determinants of health (% poverty, % unemployment, % graduating high school, % graduating college) and measures of guns in circulation (AFT registered weapons, Giffords Center ranking and rate of adults owning guns) to the death rate, injury rate, and combined injury and death rate from mass shootings in each state. All associations were evaluated via Pearson&rsquo;s Rho and the slope and p value were analyzed for each comparison, with a threshold significance value of p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 39 states with mass shooting events, rates of death and injury varied widely. The highest rates of mortality (4.3 deaths per million) and injury (22.8 injuries per million) both occurred in Louisiana, while the lowest rates of mortality (0.17 deaths per million) and injury (1.19 injuries per million) occurred in Minnesota and Oregon, respectively. Bivariate analysis revealed poverty (P=0.0116, slope=0.148), unemployment (P=0.029, slope=0.99), Giffords Center ranking (P=0.24, slope=0.027), and gun ownership (P=0.034, slope=0.033) were positively correlated with morality rates, while college graduation (P=0.05, slope=-0.06) was negatively correlated with mortality. While no factors were associated with increased injury rates, both unemployment (P=0.0345, slope=22.1) and number of ATF registered weapons (P=0.019, slope=0.0028) were positively correlated with an increased risk of combined injury or death. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: States with increased poverty, higher unemployment, lower educational attainment, increased rates of gun ownership and more lenient gun-control laws tend to have a higher rates of death due to mass shootings. Future analyses should focus on determining which specific policies might help prevent such shootings in the future.

There is increasing concern regarding the attrition of surgeon-scientists in academic surgery, including in cardiothoracic (CT) surgery. To sustain the basic science research (BSR) that has driven innumerable innovations in CT surgery, it is essential to understand the trends in research conducted by CT surgery trainees. We hypothesized that the proportion of CT surgery trainees publishing BSR has declined.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using a database of 1,065 CT surgeons at accredited United States (US) training institutions in 2020, surgeons who began their attending career within the past 3 decades were included for analysis, and those who had trained internationally were excluded. Publication records were obtained from Scopus, and non-articles (e.g., letters, editorials) were excluded. Articles with PubMed medical subject heading terms involving molecular/cellular or animal research were classified as BSR using the National Institutes of Health iCite database. All other research was classified as non-BSR. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 623 US-trained academic CT surgeons were included in this analysis, of whom 148 (23.8%) started their attending career in 1991-2000, 228 (36.6%) in 2001-2010, and 247 (39.6%) in 2011-2020. As shown in Figure 1, while the proportion of surgeons who published any research during training increased from 83.1% to 90.8% to 91.1% over the past 3 decades (p=0.0281), the proportion of surgeons who published BSR during training increased from 64.2% to 76.8% from 1991-2010 (p=0.0082) but fell sharply to 61.5% in the past decade (p=0.0003). In contrast, the proportion of surgeons who published non-BSR during training increased steadily from 72.3% to 81.6% to 88.3% over this period (p=0.0003), and the proportion of surgeons who published only non-BSR during training sharply increased from 14.0% to 29.6% over the past decade (p&lt;0.0001). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Although CT surgery trainees are increasingly involved in research, those publishing molecular/cellular and animal-based BSR have decreased significantly over the past decade. In order to foster the development of future CT surgeon-scientists, additional opportunities and support must be provided to trainees interested in BSR.

Cummins<sup>1</sup>, R. S. Radhakrishnan<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Objective measurements for applicant ranking are becoming increasingly important, not only to help address the growing number of general surgery applicants each year but also to minimize bias and ensure consistency. Our institution utilizes pre-interview and interview scores to assess applicants based on academic criteria and interview performance. We aimed to assess if our general surgery applicant scoring system was an effective tool for accurately predicting results of the resident match.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of general surgery applicant rank lists from 2017-2020 at one academic institution was conducted. Applicants were ranked based on the sum of their pre-interview and interview scores. The pre-interview score is an objective metric related to the applicant&rsquo;s academic portfolio. The interview score is also a standardized score, averaged over several interviews, given to each applicant based on their interview performance. All interviews occurred in-person. We reviewed match results from all ranked candidates and placed them into the following categories: academic categorical program, community categorical program, preliminary position, non-surgical specialty match, and unmatched. Data analysis included one-way ANOVA with Tukey&rsquo;s multiple comparisons test, and a 95% level of confidence was assumed (&alpha; =0.05). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:From 2017 to 2020, a total of 378 applicants were interviewed. Forty-nine percent of interviewees matched into academic categorical, 22% into community categorical, 11% into preliminary, and 5% into nonsurgical specialty positions, while 13% of interviewees went unmatched. Applicants who matched into academic categorical positions had significantly higher pre-interview scores (p&lt;0.001) and interview scores (p&lt;0.001) than applicants in all other categories. Applicants who matched into community categorical positions had significantly higher interview scores than those who matched into preliminary positions (p=0.01) and went unmatched (p=0.01), but their pre-interview scores did not differ significantly from unmatched applicants. Applicants who did not match into a categorical position (preliminary, nonsurgical, or unmatched) did not have significantly different pre-interview or interview scores from one another. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our standardized and simplified scoring system was effective in stratifying which applicants would match into categorical general surgery residencies. Strong interview skills may have differentiated applicants who matched into a community program from those who went unmatched. Further studies will be necessary to determine if virtual interview platforms allow for the same success in identifying applicants who will match into a surgical residency.

Although incivility has been described in other medical specialties, little is known about perpetrators in academic surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In October- November 2020, we disseminated a web-based survey to residents, fellows, and faculty at 16 academic institutions across the U.S. that had training programs in General Surgery, Integrated Thoracic Surgery, Integrated Vascular Surgery, and Integrated Plastic Surgery. In addition to evaluating incivility via the 12-item Workplace Incivility Scale (WIS), respondents were asked to attribute and describe the perpetrators of the incivility that they reported. Multivariable regressions were built to determine the association between type and number of perpetrators and levels of incivility.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We received responses from 367 out of 2,661 (13.8%) surgeons. Of the respondents, 183 (49.8%) were faculty and 143 (39.3%) were residents or fellows. Additionally, the most common perpetrators of incivility were faculty (58.6%), patients (36.8%) and nursing staff (31.9%). Compared to men surgeons, women reported more incivility perpetrated by faculty (p=0.006), patients (p&lt;0.001), and nursing staff (p=0.002). After controlling for gender, position, race, region and specialty, we found that incivility scores of respondents who reported faculty as the perpetrator had incivility scores that were 0.61 higher than those who did not report faculty as perpetrators (&beta;=0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.82). Similarly, individuals who experienced incivility from nurses incurred a 0.23 increase in their overall scores (&beta;=0.23, 95% CI 0.009-0.45). In contrast, there was no difference in incivility scores between individuals who experienced patient-driven incivility and those who did not (&beta;=0.003, 95% CI -0.22-0.22). Moreover, higher levels of incivility were significantly associated with a greater number of perpetrators (&beta;=0.17, 95% CI 0.09-0.26).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: More exposure to perpetrators of incivility increases overall levels of incivility. Identifying perpetrators of incivility in academic surgery can help us create and implement strategies to reduce this insidious form of mistreatment and ultimately, allow individuals, teams, and organizations to succeed and thrive.

Grenda<sup>1</sup>, R. Tholey<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Thomas Jefferson University, Department Of Surgery, Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Over the last several years, categorical general surgery residency programs have become increasingly competitive, with national match rates decreasing steadily from 93% in 2018 to 73% in the most recent 2021 match. While mentorship has been previously identified as a crucial factor in drawing medical students to general surgery and surgical subspecialities, there is a dearth of information demonstrating the role of mentorship in successfully matching those students to surgery programs.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We implemented a structured mentorship program for medical students interested in applying to general surgery residency over the course of one year, consisting of seven standardized meetings and events. These events included a Surgery Open House, MS3 Spring Meeting, a Surgery Retreat, MS4 Summer Meeting, a Chair&rsquo;s Meeting, Mock Interviews, and a Rank List Meeting. All meetings except for the Surgery Open House and Surgery Retreat were conducted one-on-one with the surgery clerkship director or assistant clerkship director. Following Match Day, we solicited self-reported application information and sent students a 5-point Likert scale survey to assess the perceived utility of each event.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 22 students at a single institution who applied to general surgery residency and attended the structured mentorship program, 100% matched into a categorical program, significantly higher than the 73% national match rate of US MD seniors into general surgery (p &lt; 0.01). There were no significant differences between the national and institutional cohorts in terms of USMLE board scores, AOA status, or mean number of publications, research, work, or volunteer experiences. Nineteen of the 22 students responded to the survey, yielding an 86% response rate. Ninety percent of the students attended at least six out of the seven events. All events had at least an 83% attendance rate. Six out of the 7 events had mean helpfulness scores (out of 5) that were significantly higher than &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; (p &lt; 0.01) (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We demonstrate that a structured mentorship program is perceived as helpful by fourth year medical students applying to general surgery and furthermore may play a useful role in successfully matching applicants to categorical programs. In particular, structured mentorship conducted by surgery faculty who are dedicated to medical student education ensures that students do not receive differing experiences based on their mentor&rsquo;s familiarity with current application trends. Implementing similar programs at medical schools across the country would be a simple and low-cost means for increasing the success of students applying to surgery residency as the match rate becomes increasingly competitive.

Little is known about perceptions from the Low and Middle Income Country (LMIC) partners regarding global surgery collaborations with High-Income Countries (HIC). We performed a survey of LMIC surgical society members to investigate their perception of partnerships. We hypothesized that types of collaborations have increased but often lack a suitable structure. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A survey was distributed via Redcap from May to August 2021 to LMIC surgical society representatives worldwide to assess the nature and perception of collaborations, funding, benefits, communication, and the effects of COVID on partnerships.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

We received 16 individual responses representing 8 countries on 4 continents. There were no regional trends in responses. The majority (80%) participated in collaborations within 5 years, 40% were facilitated virtually. Most interactions were occasional (60%) and for clinical research. North America was the major HIC partner but programs existed with other continents and across respondents&rsquo; own regions (15%). Most (59%) reported HIC teams involved in operating, with 60% of these also involved in non-operative clinical care and 80% in educational activities. 

While clinical partnerships (43%) and educational partnerships (33%) were ranked as most important, sustainability was most achieved in education/training (73.3%) and research (66.7%). The biggest benefit of collaborations cited was faculty exchange and trainee education (81% and 69%). During COVID, 83.3% of individuals continued collaborations in education (80%) or research (50%), but 50% felt that relationships are weaker. 

Most (59%) reported HIC teams performed operations but only 33% stated HIC teams understood the LMIC clinical/operating room or educational environment well prior to arrival. Furthermore, 77% reported that while they adequately expressed their clinical needs before visitor arrival, 60% stated they were the ones to initiate the conversation, and 47% said their HIC partner understood the local environment inadequately at arrival. While most felt that HIC visitors understood the LMIC research environment (60%), 86% felt a formal process would benefit all parties in assessing needs prior to collaboration. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our study provides a worldwide snapshot of LMIC surgeon&#39;s perspectives. Collaborations are increasingly diverse with sustainable interactions occurring in research and education, in addition to clinical interactions.

Independent of location, LMIC partners cite inadequate initial structure for long-term interactions, HIC partner&rsquo;s understanding of the local needs, and funding as barriers to success.

A formal initiation process between partners at the outset of a partnership to assess resources and needs can serve as a framework for a successful relationship. The next steps include a mixed-methods review, incorporating focus groups of respondents, to design a process to launch collaborations that breed bilateral success and satisfaction.

Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability of being aware of our feelings and the feelings of others in order to effectively manage our environment. We aimed to describe the EI of residents, and to understand the relationship between EI, academic performance and quality of life among residents.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This was a cross-sectional study based on a voluntary survey of residents in a university hospital. Sociodemographic and academic characteristics were collected. We divided residents into technique-oriented and person-oriented subgroups. EI was measured using the Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS);a 16 item self-report scale defining 4 ability dimensions:(1)expression of emotion in self,(2)recognition of emotion in others,(3)regulation of self emotions,(4)use of emotions. Each item was answered following a 7point Likert-scale. Quality of life was assessed using EuroQol-5D-VAS; range from -0.59 to 1. Number of publications, active academic participation, perceived sense of professional accomplishment, auto-satisfaction of care provided, and teacher&rsquo;s satisfaction of their academic performance were collected.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
56 residents were included. The mean age was 28.1&plusmn;2.17, 58.9% were female. Technique-oriented specialty was (58.9%) and Person-oriented specialty (39.3%). Multivariate analysis found auto-satisfaction of provided care to be higher in resident with higher self emotion recognition ability (&beta;=1.58;[0.68;2.48];p&lt;0.001), good regulation of emotions (&beta;=1.37;[0.23;2.51];p=0.019), and better use of self emotions (&beta;=1.55;[0.24;2.87];p=0.021). Self-emotion appraisal was significantly higher in technique-oriented specialties (&beta;=.68;[0.18;1.18];p=0.008). And finally, better quality of sleep represented by more sleep hours was associated with higher ability to regulate self-emotions (&beta;=.32[-0.06;0.58];p=0.017), and other&rsquo;s emotions recognition (&beta;=0.32;[-0.01;0.62];p=0.038)

Data were provided by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) from the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). Applicants and matriculants to categorical GS residency positions and fellowship programs (Complex General Surgical Oncology, Pediatric, Cardiothoracic, Vascular, and Colorectal Surgery) were reported. Only graduates of U.S. medical schools are reported. The data were stratified by applicant-reported sex. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS&reg;9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to evaluate change in the distribution of male and female matriculants over time. Match rates by sex were calculated as a ratio of matriculants to all applicants for each program and compared across years using a two-tailed Fisher&rsquo;s exact test and z-test of proportions.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

From 2008-2019, 23,225 U.S. medical students applied to GS, including 8,898 females (38%) and 14,314 (62%) males. Categorical GS positions were secured by 48% of applicants. Match rates were higher for female applicants (54% versus 44%; p&lt;0.05). Sex parity among matriculants significantly improved over time (p=0.003), with females comprising 43% of matriculants overall (annual range 41.5-48.5%; Figure 1a).

From 2008-2018, 3,320 GS graduates applied to U.S. fellowship positions, including 1,167 (35%) females and 2,152 (65%) males. Fellowship positions were secured by 81% of applicants. A significantly lower proportion of females applied to fellowship compared to residency (p&lt;0.05). Match rates were lower for females than males (76% versus 84%; p&lt;0.05). Sex parity among fellowship matriculants significantly improved over time (p=0.002), with females comprising 33% of matriculants overall (annual range 25-38%). The subspecialty fellowships that demonstrated the greatest degree of sex parity were Complex General Surgical Oncology, Colorectal, and Pediatric Surgery (Figure 1b-f).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Over time, the sex gap has narrowed, with increasing numbers and proportions of female applicants matriculating into GS residencies. Additionally, there was a narrowing of the sex gap at the surgery fellowship level, best exemplified by Pediatric and Colorectal Surgery.

Anderson<sup>1, 2</sup>, R. T. Russell<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, AL, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Childrens of Alabama, Division Of Pediatric Surgery, Birmingham, AL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Annually, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) publicly reports aggregate data on the number of teaching cases logged by surgical residents across the United States. The designation of a &ldquo;teaching case&rdquo; exemplifies a resident&rsquo;s mastery of the operation such that he or she can lead another resident through key steps. The ACGME requires residents to obtain a minimum of 25 teaching cases to graduate from an accredited general surgery program. We hypothesized that resident work hour restrictions and increasing fellowship positions have led to a decline in resident teaching assistant cases.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A review of publicly available ACGME case logs from 1999-2020 was performed. Cases categorized as &ldquo;Teach Assist (TA)&rdquo; were evaluated. Specifically, the more traditional General Surgery cases within the following categories were reviewed: esophagus, stomach, biliary, small intestine, large intestine, hernia, anorectal, and breast. All available aggregate data were analyzed using simple linear regression analysis. Results were reported for case numbers at the 90th percentile, representing the ninety percent of residents who recorded greater than or equal to the reported number of TA cases for the specified year.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified a significant decrease in the number of TA cases for several important General Surgery categories, including esophagus, stomach, large intestine, hernia, and breast cases (p &lt; 0.05). Please see Table 1 for details. Though not all reaching significance, all case categories reviewed had regression lines with negative slopes, indicating a downward trend was identified. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Teaching cases have significantly decreased across several areas of General Surgery residency over the last 20 years, corresponding with increasing popularity and growth of post-graduate fellowship positions. Given the well-established relationship between volume and quality applied in surgical outcomes assessment, this finding may reflect an area for improvement in surgical education.

We examined trends in racial/ethnic and gender representation among general surgery (GS) residents and complex surgical oncology (CSO) fellows in the United States (US) over time.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data were obtained from the American Association of Medical Colleges for proportions of GS residents, CSO fellows, and full-time surgical faculty in the US. Self-reported gender and race/ethnicity were collected from 2011-2012 through 2019-2020. Race/ethnicity was defined as White; Black or African American [BA]; Asian; American Indian or Alaskan Native [AI/AN]; Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish Origin [HLS]; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander [NH/PI]; Multiple Races/Ethnicities; Other; and Unknown. URiM was defined as BA, AI/AN, HLS, or NH/PI. Data were provided in aggregate for each program as proportions by year. Race/ethnicity and gender rates were summarized with mean (standard deviation). Analysis of variance was used to test for differences over time. Race/ethnicity and gender were compared between faculty and learners using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Linear regression was used to estimate the association of year and proportions of female and URiM faculty with proportions of female and URiM fellows.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Resident, fellow, and faculty data were available for 340, 26, and 145 programs, respectively. The proportion of female (34.0% to 41.9%), Multiple Races/Ethnicities (7.0% to 8.3%), and Unknown Race/Ethnicity (0% to 1.2%) residents increased, while proportions of male (66.0% to 58.0%) and White residents (53.8% to 49.7%) decreased (all p&lt;0.01). There was no change in the proportion of URiM residents (p=0.67). Among CSO fellows, the proportion of NH/PI fellows decreased from 2011 to 2012 (5.6% to 0%; p&lt;0.001) and remained at 0% from 2012-2019. Compared to faculty, CSO fellows included more women (42.8% vs 22.4%) and fewer White (52.9% vs 66.6%) and AI/AN (0.0% vs 0.2%) individuals (all p&lt;0.01). The presence of more female faculty was associated with a program&rsquo;s having more URiM fellows (+83.5% fellows/every 100% increase in female faculty, 95% CI 30.2-136.7%, p=0.002; Figure 1), but there was no significant association between increasing URiM faculty and increased proportions of URiM or female fellows.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite gains among women, there has been no change in URiM representation among surgical learners. Having more female surgical faculty may have a positive impact on other forms of diversity among learners, but more effort is needed to increase racial/ethnic representation across the continuum of surgical education and practice.

Most general surgery graduates pursue fellowship after residency, leaving a small pool of newly trained surgeons to fill the ongoing need for broad-based general surgeons. Little is known about the variations in operative experience between residents who go directly into general surgery practice compared to those pursuing fellowship.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The US Resident OPerative Experience (ROPE) Collaborative consists of 18 ACGME-accredited general surgery residency programs. Demographics and case logs from graduates between 2010-2020 and their programs were analyzed. Residents entering general surgery practice were compared to those entering fellowship. Residents and training programs in the highest tertile for case numbers were classified as high-volume.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

1,209 general surgery residents graduated over the 11-year period. 19.7% (n=238) went directly into general surgery practice while 80.3% (n=971) pursued fellowship. There were no differences in age or sex. White residents were more likely to go into practice than into fellowship (74.8% vs 66.0%), whereas fellowship training was more common for black (5.6% vs 2.9%) and Asian (16.7% vs 11.8%) residents (p&lt;0.01). Residents who went directly into practice were more likely to be high-volume residents (42.9% vs 31.0%, p&lt;0.01) and graduate from a high-volume program (36.6% vs 28.6%, p&lt;0.01). Going into practice was associated with lower rates of completing research time (22.3% vs 47.9%, p&lt;0.01) and was less common for international medical graduates (IMG) (8.0% vs 12.8%, p=0.04). Graduates who entered general surgery practice completed more total cases (1199 vs 1149, p&lt;0.01), occurring both as surgeon junior and surgeon chief. These residents also performed on average 61 more &ldquo;general surgery&rdquo; cases than fellowship-bound residents (691 vs 632, p&lt;0.01) (FIGURE). Logistic regression identified variation among individual programs producing general surgeons (p&lt;0.01). Additionally, going into practice had a positive association with increased operative volume (OR=1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.9, p&lt;0.01) and a negative association with being an IMG (OR=0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6, p&lt;0.01) or completing lab experience (OR=0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5, p&lt;0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

This is the first study exploring residents&rsquo; operative experience as it relates to career choice. In this cohort, only 20% of graduates went into general surgery. Graduates who forgo fellowship training tended to have higher case volumes with more general surgery exposure and lower rates of pursuing dedicated research time. Better understanding the factors associated with going into general surgery may encourage this pathway as a career option and may have important public health implications.

It is also the leading cause of death with COVID-19. Acute inflammation is a central feature in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury (ALI) and subsequently ARDS. The need for mechanical ventilation can further exacerbate lung damage by ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Current treatment for ARDS is mainly limited to supportive care. We have previously shown that intratracheal (IT) delivery of CNP-miR146a, a radical scavenging cerium oxide nanoparticle (CNP) conjugated to the anti-inflammatory microRNA(miR)-146a, reduces bleomycin-induced acute lung injury by decreasing inflammatory infiltrates and oxidative stress. We hypothesized that CNP-miR146a treatment would further protect against secondary VILI by decreasing pro-inflammatory signaling in a bleomycin lung injury model.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 8-10 week old C57BL/6 mice (n = 64) were given IT bleomycin (5units/kg) to induce lung injury or 50&mu;L saline (control). Three days following injury, mice received IT administration of 1ng/50&mu;L CNP-miR146a (Bleomycin + CNP-miR146a) or an equivalent volume of saline (Control, Bleomycin). At seven days post-injury, a subset of mice were anesthetized, tracheostomized, and mechanically ventilated for 3 hours at tidal volume 20cc/kg, respiratory rate 75 breaths/minute, and positive end expiratory pressure 3 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 (+VILI). Whole lungs were then harvested and processed for total RNA extraction. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to evaluate expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA (p&lt;0.05 significant).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In this two-hit model, we found that bleomycin injured lungs were prone to a second-hit injury from mechanical ventilation. Compared to ventilated controls, ventilated bleomycin-injured mice had significantly higher relative gene expression of pro-inflammatory IL-6 (p = 0.0272), IL-8 (p = 0.0168), and TNF&alpha; (p = 0.0253). In addition, treatment with CNP-miR146a significantly lowered expression of IL-6 (p = 0.015), IL-8 (p = 0.0061), and TNF&alpha; (p = 0.0002) compared to control, ventilated, bleomycin-injured mice.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Treatment of bleomycin-induced lung injury with CNP-miR146a significantly decreases pro-inflammatory gene expression and provides additional protection against inflammation due to secondary VILI. CNP-miR146a has significant promise as a potential therapeutic for the treatment of ARDS and mitigation of secondary VILI.

Providing a functional copy of the deficient fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) gene in utero, before development of a fully functional immune system, can induce tolerance to the transgene as well as mitigate concerns for immune reaction to the viral vector, and rapid expansion of fetal cells may improve the extent of liver repopulation with genetically corrected hepatocytes while preventing early organ damage from disease. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Direct fetal intrahepatic injections of a lentiviral vector carrying the human FAH gene under control of the alpha-1 antitrypsin promoter were performed in six FAH<sup>-/-</sup> pig fetuses at 66-73 days of gestation at a dose of 3x10<sup>8</sup>-1.6x10<sup>9 </sup>transducing units per fetus. Mothers were maintained on the protective drug 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) through gestation, and piglets were maintained on NTBC until weaning. After weaning, four pigs were cycled on/off NTBC to stimulate expansion of FAH-positive hepatocytes. Cure was determined through clinical, biochemical, and histological parameters: NTBC-independent growth; normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests; and liver repopulation with corrected, FAH-positive hepatocytes. PCR screening of maternal and fetal tissues was performed to evaluate for target and off-target vector presence. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics analysis was also performed to explore lentiviral integration profile in the liver. Finally, RNA sequencing was performed to evaluate changes in hepatic gene expression after in utero gene therapy as compared to no treatment, NTBC treatment, and wild-type. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of the long-term animals, two achieved NTBC independence immediately, without requiring any cycles on the drug, and two achieved NTBC-independent growth at 35-72 days post-weaning, after 2-4 cycles on the drug. This was accompanied by normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels showed an age-appropriate decrease over time. On immunohistochemical analysis, FAH-positive hepatocytes were present at birth and had begun to clonally expand by 8 days of life. This expansion continued over time, with complete repopulation with FAH-positive hepatocytes seen by 278 days of life, and no evidence of histopathological abnormalities or hepatocellular carcinoma found. NGS showed a benign lentiviral integration profile within the liver that was broadly reproducible between animals. RNA sequencing showed a gene expression profile after in utero gene therapy that approached that of wild-type animals and was markedly different from that of FAH<sup>-/-</sup> animals off NTBC.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Lentiviral liver-directed gene therapy delivered in utero provides a stable, long-term cure for HT1 with an acceptable safety profile for both mother and fetus.

We have previously shown that neutrophil attenuation potentiates chemosensitivity in murine models of PDAC. Given recent evidence highlighting the complex intersection between chemosensitivity, anti-tumor immunity, and the gut microbiome in solid tumors, we sought to investigate if the enhanced chemosensitivity observed with neutrophil attenuation in PDAC is associated with a distinct gut microbial ecology.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: C57BL/6 mice were orthotopically injected with syngeneic Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>;Trp53<sup>fl/+</sup>;Pdx-<sup>Cre</sup> (KPC) PDAC cells, and randomized into four treatment groups after 10d tumor growth (n=8-10/arm): vehicle control, anti-Ly6G antibody treatment alone with neutrophil-attenuating&mdash;but not depleting&mdash;dosing (25 &mu;g/dose) q3d, gemcitabine (100 mg/kg) and paclitaxel (10 mg/kg) qwk (G/P), and G/P+anti-Ly6G. Mice were sacrificed following 3 weeks of treatment, and tumors subjected to flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Fecal samples from mice in each treatment group (n=3/group) were collected 10d after treatment and submitted for shotgun metagenomic sequencing.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Treatment with G/P+anti-Ly6G significantly increased infiltration of intratumoral CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, as well as augmented antigen experience (PD-1<sup>+</sup>) and degranulating capacity (CD107a<sup>+</sup>) in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, compared with G/P alone, anti-Ly6G alone, or vehicle arms. Bray-Curtis principal coordinate analysis of microbial &beta;-diversity revealed significant differences in microbial composition with anti-Ly6G alone, G/P alone, and G/P+anti-Ly6G compared with vehicle treatment. While no differences in bacterial species abundance were observed between anti-Ly6G alone vs. G/P alone, or anti-Ly6G alone vs. G/P+anti-Ly6G groups, 37 species were differentially abundant between G/P+anti-Ly6G and G/P-treated cohorts (p-adj&lt;0.05). Seven Alistipes spp. (class Bacteroidea)&mdash;previously associated with chemoresistance in other solid cancers&mdash;were significantly reduced in the gut microbiome of G/P+anti-Ly6G-treated mice. Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, previously associated with PDAC tumor progression, was the most significantly reduced bacterial species in the gut microbiome of G/P+anti-Ly6G-treated mice when compared with G/P alone-treated mice (Fig).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our data unearth potential crosstalk between a distinct but narrow gut microbial ecology and anti-tumor adaptive immunity in response to neutrophil attenuation that is associated with improved chemosensitivity in PDAC. Therapeutic manipulation of this microbial program may mitigate chemoresistance and improve outcomes in PDAC patients.

Murine femoral artery wire injury (FAWI) is a commonly used model of neointimal hyperplasia, an inflammatory process resulting in restenosis and failure of surgery for arterial occlusive disease. High-parameter flow cytometry allows high-resolution classification, quantification, and sorting of cell populations from a single tissue sample, but has not previously been used to study the dynamics of post-operative inflammatory cellular infiltration following FAWI.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We designed an 18-fluorochrome flow cytometry panel for leukocyte identification in digested femoral artery (FA) samples. C57BL/6 mice underwent FAWI followed by euthanasia at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days post-injury. Injured left femoral arteries and uninjured right femoral arteries were enzymatically digested into single cell suspensions that were stained and analyzed on a BD FACSymphony A5 flow cytometer and FlowJo v10 software. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of femoral artery frozen sections from the same time points with CD45 primary antibodies was used to validate leukocyte quantification from flow cytometry.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Both IF cell counts and flow cytometry quantification suggest that infiltrating CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes plateau in quantity by 7 days post-injury, then begin to decline by 14 days post-injury (Figure, panel A). As expected, injured femoral artery samples demonstrated significantly higher numbers of live leukocytes (Live/Dead<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup>) than uninjured femoral arteries at the 1-day (54,883 vs. 777 cells, p=0.05), 3-day (32085 vs. 534 cells, p=0.004), and 7-day (49,885 vs. 970 cells, p=0.02) post-injury time points. Using our high-parameter flow cytometry panel, we were able to identify and quantify live leukocyte (Live/Dead<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup>), CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>), B-lymphocyte (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>), neutrophil (CD45<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup>), NK cell (CD11b<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>), eosinophil (SiglecF<sup>+</sup>), dendritic cell (CD64<sup>-</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>), classical/intermediate/non-classical monocyte (CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD64<sup>-</sup>Tim4<sup>-</sup>), and multiple macrophage (CD64<sup>dim</sup>/<sup>+</sup>Tim4<sup>-</sup>/<sup>+</sup>) sub-populations and quantify them across a 14-day post-injury time course (Figure, panel B). Leukocyte infiltration at the 1-day post-injury time point was dominated by neutrophils, however, by 7-days post-injury, macrophage sub-populations composed the majority of infiltrating leukocytes.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Our high-parameter flow cytometry method allows for broad phenotyping of highly defined leukocyte sub-populations infiltrating in the arterial wall following FAWI with a single staining panel. This methodology has numerous downstream applications, including time-series analyses, cell sorting for gene expression analyses, identification of inflammatory surrogate markers (in conjunction with cytokine analysis), and correlation with vascular lesion formation.

Cancer cell and tumor microenvironment (TMEN) crosstalk regulates cancer behavior. CAFs in TMEN promote cancer stemness, growth and metastasis. Cancer cell derived osteopontin (OPN) is a marker for aggressive cancer growth. In separate models of human MDA-MB231 breast cancer and HepG2 liver cancer, we have demonstrated that OPN initiates mesenchymal stem cell adoption of the CAF phenotype with consequent juxtacrine increase in MB231 or HepG2 stemness. In this study, we demonstrate that cancer cell stemness is required for maintenance of the OPN induced CAF phenotype. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

MB231 or HepG2 cells and MB231(-/-sox2) or HepG2(-/-sox2) were cocultured with human MSC. In selected instances, aptamer (APT; inactivates extracellular OPN), mutant APT (control), or BBI-608 (small molecule inhibitor of cancer stemness) were added. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies were performed. MSC were cocultured with MB231(-/-sox2) or HepG2(-/-sox2) for 72h followed by substitution with wild-type (wt) MB231 or wt HepG2 and conversely, MSC+wt MB231 followed by substitution with MB231(-/-sox2) or MSC+wt HepG2 followed by substitution with HepG2(-/-sox2). At various time points, cells were harvested, and RT-PCR performed for cancer stemness markers (sox2, oct4, nanog) and CAF markers (sma, vimentin, fsp1). Data represent mean&plusmn; SD of 3 expts. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

In MB231 (or HepG2)+MSC, CAF markers (~7X) and stemness markers (~5X) increased and plateaued at 48h. OPN blockade at 0h in MB231 (or HepG2)+MSC ablated the increase in both CAF and stemness, but OPN blockade at 72h had no effect. In contrast, when BBI608 was added to MB231 (or HepG2) +MSC at 72h, CAF markers were ablated after 36h. (See Figure for MB231; HepG2 results mirror the exhibited MB231 results.) Replacing wt-MB231 with MB231(-/-sox2) (or wt HepG2 with HepG2(-/-sox2) in cocultures at 72h decreased CAF markers to baseline despite Western blot confirmed presence of OPN. Conversely, replacing MB231(-/-sox2) with wt MB231 (or HepG2(-/-sox2) with wt HepG2) increased CAF markers to a level equivalent to MB231+MSC alone. (All changes were statistically significant; p&lt;0.05)

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Cancer and CAF crosstalk increases cancer cell stemness. In this study using human breast and liver cancer cell lines, the OPN induced CAF phenotype requires cancer stemness for CAF maintenance and potentiation. This indicates that the CAF phenotype requires two distinct signalling pathways, initiation and maintenance.

Westmoreland<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Nemours Children's Health System, Biomedical Research, Orlando, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive tumor that forms from glial cells in the part of the brain stem called the pons and affects up to 300-400 children per year in the United States. Despite advances in DIPG biology, there remains no treatment that improves overall survival, and survival rates persist at less than 2% over 5 years. We propose to treat DIPG with the oncolytic Zika virus. We have previously shown that neuroblastoma cells and xenograft tumors are permissive to Zika viral infection. Because of the common heritage of DIPG and neuroblastoma, we propose that a Zika viral infection could be used as a putative therapy for patients with DIPG.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We utilized the immortalized DIPG cell line SF8628 and patient-derived cell lines SF11287, SF10423, and SF11653 to examine cell cytotoxicity after treatment with various concentrations of Zika virus. Data was collected every day for five days and measured using fluorescence-based real-time detection assays indicating both a kinetic analysis as well as an endpoint determination. In vitro cell survival was then directly correlated with examination by bright field microscopy. In addition, in vivo studies were performed in nude mice using SF8628 cells introduced subcutaneously, comparing Zika-infected tumors to vehicle. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Following treatment with Zika virus, a significant increase in cell cytotoxicity was detected in all DIPG cells as early as 24 hours with all viral concentrations, which increased significantly in a time-dependent manner over the course of 5 days. Further examination by bright field microscopy corroborated &gt;90% cell death using the highest concentration. In vivo studies revealed that introduction of Zika virus led to a loss of &gt;90% of the tumor mass by Day 14 (compared to no loss of mass in vehicle-treated cells).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The in vitro efficacy of Zika virus as a treatment for human DIPG cells is comparable to results seen in prior experiments with neuroblastoma. In vivo experiments further corroborate these results, with the measurements indicating an average loss of &gt;90% of the tumor mass over a period of 14 days in Zika-treated tumors compared to no loss of mass in the vehicle-treated controls. These results indicate that Zika virus could act as a putative therapy for the treatment of DIPG.

Colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) will develop in 60% of patients with colorectal cancer. For patients where a metastasectomy is indicated, the cure rate after CRLM resection is only 20%. Therefore new methods to improve R0 resection rates are critical. Fluorophore conjugated anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibodies have been shown to selectively label colorectal liver metastases but with limited tumor-to-liver ratio (TLR). The present study reports the use of a humanized anti-CEA antibody conjugated to a PEGylated near infrared (NIR) dye which can target liver metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model with high TLR. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The humanized anti-CEA hT84.66-M5A monoclonal antibody was conjugated in the hinge to a long chain PEG molecule with a lysine sidearm containing the near infrared IR800 dye to synthesize a conjugate termed M5A-IR800 Sidewinder. The human colon cancer LS174T cell line was surgically orthotopically implanted (SOI) in the liver and cecum of nude mice using previously grown subcutaneous tumors. Dosing and timing of imaging of orthotopic models was determined based on subcutaneous model imaging. In-vivo imaging was performed with the Pearl Trilogy Imager (LICOR, Lincoln, NE) with excitement at 800 nm.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
M5A-IR800 Sidewinder brightly and selectively imaged LS174T tumors in all 3 models. The subcutaneous model had the highest tumor to background ratio (TBR) at 72 hours after receiving 75 &micro;g of M5A-IR800 Sidewinder. The cecal orthotopic models had an average TBR of 10.1 after 72 hours. The liver orthotopic model had an average TLR of 7.5 at 72 hours.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The anti-CEA M5A-IR800 Sidewinder brightly and selectively targeted LS174T colon cancer in the liver providing clear distinction between tumor and normal tissue. This is an improvement over the non-PEGylated M5A-IR800 previously reported which successfully targeted LS174T colon cancer in a cecal orthotopic murine model but had high background signal in the liver. M5A-IR800 Sidewinder is a promising candidate for clinical use in fluorescence-guided surgery to detect CRLM and improve R0 resection.

Treatment with anti-SAS1B polyclonal antibodies and complement arrested growth of uterine tumor cells, and saporin-immunotoxin directed at SAS1B induced cell death. Study goals were to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human SAS1B, develop a cytotoxic reagent targeting SAS1B using mAbs, determine tumor cell types expressing SAS1B, and assess normal tissue SAS1B expression.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Monoclonal antibodies were generated to recombinant (r) human (h) SAS1B. Mass spectrometry confirmed SAS1B recognition. SAS1B deletion constructs mapped epitopes recognized by SB2/SB5 mAbs to the N-terminal domain. Human cancer cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of mAb and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ATP was quantitated as a measure of viability. SAS1B surface expression of human normal and tumor cell lines were evaluated by flow cytometry after staining with SB2, either with viable cells to assess surface staining or permeabilized cells to assess intracellular plus surface staining, with and without SAS1B blocking peptide.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The SB2/SB5 epitope is located between amino acids 32-39 of SAS1B. SB2/SB5 mAbs demonstrated Western immunoreactivity to rhSAS1B in E. coli/HEK293T cells. SAS1B serves as a target for Ab-mediated cytotoxicity by ADC which is blocked by the SAS1B-specific N-terminal peptide, as cell viability decreased with increasing ADC concentrations. Monoclonal antibodies SB2/SB5, complexed with a Fab-Duocarmycin DM, were cytotoxic to SAS1B+ uterine, lung, renal, and pancreatic tumor cells (Figure 1). SAS1B N-terminus surface and cytoplasmic expression of these tumor cell lines, ovary, breast, and melanoma were confirmed by flow cytometry and SAS1B[24-42] peptide blocking. Intracellular SAS1B was detected in normal aortic endothelium, skeletal muscle, pancreatic islets, kidney, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and lymph node. However, surface SAS1B was not detected on normal cardiac myocytes (0.1% of cells), aortic endothelium (0.8%), skeletal muscle (0.8%), pancreatic islets (0.65%), kidney (0.7%), skin fibroblasts (1.1%), PBMCs (0.1%), lymph node (0.2%), and spleen (0.2%), compared to MDA-MB-468 (38%). Only staining of MDA-MB-468 was blocked by the SAS1B[24-42] peptide (96%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: SAS1B is expressed on surfaces of multiple tumor cell types, but not on those of normal cells. The SB2/SB5 epitope is between amino acids 32-39. The SB2/SB5 mAbs offer promise as candidate immunotherapeutic entities for targeting SAS1B+ cancer cells with defined epitopes in the SAS1B N-terminal domain suitable for immunotherapeutic targeting with ADC or an scFv/CAR-T approach.

Mice are the most commonly used animal model to study PC. The approval rate for new anti-cancer drugs is only 5-8%, suggesting that more accurate animal PC models are needed. Swine have increased genetic, epigenetic, physiological, metabolic, pharmacologic, immunologic, and size similarity to humans compared to mice. This study focuses on developing an orthotopic porcine model of PC. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using open surgical biopsy of the porcine pancreas, porcine epithelial cells were isolated and transformed with overexpression of mutant KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and SV40T. Minnesota minipigs (n=11) subsequently underwent orthotopic autologous (n=5), allogeneic with and without oral immunosuppression (cyclosporine; n=4), both autologous and allogeneic (n = 1), or control (matrix only; n = 1) implantation of transformed cells (10-40M cells in 250&micro;L porcine collagen) into the pancreas. Implantation sites were marked with metal clips. Swine were euthanized 6-8 weeks after implantation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Orthotopic implantation of transformed porcine pancreatic epithelial cells resulted in no tumor nodules on gross or histologic review at 6-8 weeks. At least two subjects had microscopic foci of metaplasia with transgene expression. There was evidence of active immune response at the implantation sites and nearby lymph nodes. Immune reaction appeared more prominent in allogeneic implants, despite immunosuppression. The control subject showed no evidence of active immune response or prior surgery. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Orthotopic implantation of allogeneic and/or autologous transformed pancreatic epithelial cells in wild-type swine produced no overt tumor at 6-8 weeks.

Pancreatic cancer is the third most common cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. Despite decades of research on the immunologically cold tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer, contemporary immunotherapeutic options, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, have failed to improve the mortality rate. Toll like receptor (TLR) agonists have been extensively evaluated to serve as immuno-adjuncts to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, and the results have been controversial. In the present study, we evaluated the TLR-4 agonist, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as an anti-cancer therapy and its effects on the expression of anti-tumor inflammatory markers in pancreatic cancer. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
C57BL/6J mice were subjected to subcutaneous tumor injections of syngeneic KPC (LSL-Kras<sup>G12D/-</sup>;LSL-Trp53<sup>R172H/-</sup>;Pdx1-Cre) pancreatic cancer cell line (10<sup>5</sup> cells per mouse). Mice were randomized to receive either LPS (1mg/kg) or saline intraperitoneally on day 10 and day 17 post tumor implantation. Tumor measurements were obtained every third day after the initial injection, and the final tumor weights were obtained at the endpoint. Subcutaneous tumors were resected from the mice, RNA was isolated, cDNA was prepared, and RT-PCR was performed. Tumor samples were profiled for inflammatory markers, including interferon gamma (IFNg), interleukin-2 (IL-2), granzyme B (GZMB), granzyme K (GZMK), and perforin (PRF). Splenocytes from tumor bearing C57BL/6J mice were treated with LPS in vitro and supernatant was collected. Supernatant was subjected to cytokine profiling employing Mouse XL Cytokine array.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
LPS administration significantly reduced the tumor burden as compared to saline administration. Differences in tumor weights between the two groups were evident as soon as the second measurement on day 13. Expression of inflammatory markers associated with Th-1 type immune response, such as IFNg and IL-2, as well as markers associated with cytotoxic T cell phenotype such as GZMB and GZMK were upregulated in the tumor samples upon LPS administration. Cytokine profiling showed an increase in anti-tumor markers including TNFa, RBP-4, and IFNg in the supernatant of LPS treated splenocytes as compared to the control.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Administration of LPS decreased the tumor burden and increased anti-tumorigenic inflammatory markers in the tumor microenvironment. This novel finding suggests that TLR4 agonists, such as LPS, have the potential to serve as immuno-adjuncts to cancer immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer. Further mechanistic studies evaluating the immuno-stimulatory effects of LPS have the potential to reveal novel molecular targets to improve pancreatic cancer therapy and disease outcomes.

However, more than 40% of patients who undergo CLND for clinically detected LN metastases have only one pathologic LN (1pLN) on final review. Those patients are at lower risk of recurrence compared to those with &gt;1 pLN. Preliminary data suggest that excision of just the one enlarged node may provide excellent regional control with less morbidity than CLND. Selection of patients for less morbid surgery requires accurate identification of those with just 1 pLN. We hypothesized that LN from patients with 1 pLN would have gene signatures of higher immune activity and less aggressive tumor characteristics, and that gene expression data could be used to predict lymph node status using machine learning. 

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to identify patients who underwent CLND for melanoma. Pathology reports available in TCGA were reviewed to identify the number of pLN. Patients were included if RNA sequencing data were available from a pLN. Differential gene expression analysis (DGE) was done, comparing those with 1 pLN vs &gt;1 pLN utilizing DESEq2. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. Significance was set at an FDR-corrected p-value of &lt; 0.05. Predictive models including deep neural network, random forest, ridge and lasso logistic regression models were trialed, using RNA gene expression, BRAF V600E/K status, and clinical data as input to predict patients with 1pLN vs &gt;1pLN. 

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The final cohort included 154 patients with 64 (42%) identified as having 1 pLN and 90 (58%) having &gt;1 pLN. DGE analysis revealed 415 differentially expressed genes. GSEA demonstrated numerous down-regulated pathways in the 1pLN group, including cell cycle activation, oxidative phosphorylation, hypoxia, DNA repair, KRAS signaling, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Up-regulated pathways included interferon alpha signaling and coagulation. Ridge regression was the best predictive model. Forward selection of input variables resulted in 26 variables (3 T-stage variables: T2, T3a and T4a) and 23 genes) whose expression was used to predict patients with 1pLN vs &gt;1pLN. The ridge regression model was 83% accurate at predicting patients with either 1pLN or &gt;1pLN correctly, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 93% on test data using 10-fold cross-validation. 

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: The gene expression landscape of LN metastases from patients with &gt;1pLN appears to be distinct from that of patients with 1pLN. Tumors form patients with 1pLN demonstrated significantly lower markers of tumor aggression and higher immune activity. The predictive model was relatively accurate in selecting patients with just 1pLN. Future models incorporating imaging may improve in accuracy and may predict patients who can safely be managed with targeted excision rather than CLND.

TLS are associated with improved survival in melanoma. Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a unique subset of melanoma that is difficult to diagnose and locally aggressive, but less inclined to distant metastasis and more responsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). In our previous work, we have noted that DM TLS are present within the tumor itself rather than localized in the periphery as in non-desmoplastic cutaneous melanoma metastases (CMM). We hypothesize that DM TLS have increased immune activity compared to other melanoma subtypes. To test this hypothesis, we compared cell proliferation in DM TLS and CMM TLS

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: TLS were evaluated by multiplex immunofluorescence histology by staining for CD20, CD8, PNAd, and Ki67. Lymphoid aggregates were identified in 20x spectrally unmixed images by visual inspection and identified as TLS if possessing organized T and B-cell regions as well as high endothelial venule-like vasculature (PNAd<sup>+</sup>). TLS were identified in 30 out of 64 screened (48%) CMM, and 8 out of 11 screened (73%) DM. Immune cells localized in TLS were enumerated using Halo software (Indica Labs). Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In comparison to CMM, the TLS of DM had increased densities of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (p = 0.0006) and CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells (p &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, DM had increased densities of proliferating (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (p = 0.0013) and CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells (p = 0.0001) as well as an increased percentage of proliferating (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells (p=0.0088). Furthermore, in DM the proliferative fractions of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD20<sup>+</sup> cells were closely correlated between the TLS and the tumor center (p &lt; 0.001). This is in contrast to our previous work with CMM, where the intra-TLS and intra-tumoral B and T cell proliferation rates were discordant.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have identified three key differences between the TLS of DM compared to CMM: (1) TLS in CMM are located peritumorally while TLS in CMM are located intratumorally. (2) Proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD20<sup>+</sup> cells at the TLS site are correlated with proliferation in the intratumoral infiltrates in DM but are discordant in CMM. (3) DM TLS have increased densities of CD20<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, as well as an increased density of proliferation within those B and T cell populations. These differences suggest that there may be greater immune activation, increased germinal center maturation, or less regulation in DM TLS. Additionally, the synchronous activity of the B and T cells in the TLS and tumor sites suggests that the programs controlling proliferation and activation in the DM TLS may be concordant with those affecting the tumor microenvironment overall. These unique features of DM TLS may contribute to DM&#39;s high response rate to ICB.

George<sup>1</sup>, A. Holder<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The most important prognostic factor for patients with cutaneous melanoma is the presence of nodal metastasis. Macrophages are known to be present not only in the primary tumor of cutaneous melanoma but also in tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Macrophages are important in immune regulation, growth factor production, and antigen presentation. However, the function and tissue of origin of macrophages found in LNs draining melanoma are poorly understood.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We developed a B16F10 dorsal forelimb subcutaneous melanoma model in adult male and female C57BL/6 mice. We photoconverted B16F10 tumors in Kikume Green-Red (KikGR) mice using 10-minute treatment with a 405nm laser to change fluorescent, cell surface protein labels from green to red and permit tracking of tumor-derived macrophages. We partially depleted macrophages systemically using liposomal clodronate to study: 1) tumor-derived macrophage function, 2) their effect on primary tumor size, and 3) their impact on TDLN immune microenvironment using single cell RNA. We analyzed results using two-tailed t test and ANOVA with Tukey&rsquo;s post-test, with p &lt; 0.05 considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We demonstrated that 2x10<sup>5</sup> B16F10 cells generated acceptable primary tumors in 14 days with microscopic evidence of LN metastases (Fig 1A). We observed the presence of photoconverted tumor-derived macrophages in the TDLN in Kikume-green-red mice (Fig 1B) within 1 hour of tumor photoconversion. Liposomal clodronate demonstrated a trend toward depleting macrophages in the primary tumor (Fig 1C). Single cell RNA sequencing revealed a unique population of cytotoxic CD8 T cells following macrophage depletion with liposomal clodronate (Cluster 4; Fig 1D and 1E).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study provides novel evidence of migration of tumor-associated macrophages to TDLNs within an hour. Our single cell RNA sequencing data suggest that macrophages migrating from the primary tumor to the TDLN may modulate the immune microenvironment through suppression of a trancriptomically-unique cytotoxic CD8 T cell subpopulation. Future studies are needed to validate these results including more complete macrophage depletion and characterization of differentially-expressed genes in this CD8 T cell subpopulation.

Methods of studying appendix cancer biology are limited, as reliable in vitro and in vivo models are largely unavailable. We developed an organotypic slice culture model of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms and demonstrate its utility to study the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) using flow cytometry and immunostaining. We next treated tumor slices with TAK-981, a novel inhibitor of SUMOylation, and demonstrate marked changes in the TIME suggesting the potential for immunotherapeutic approaches to this tumor type.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Tumor samples were collected from patients undergoing debulking operations. Informed consent was obtained, and samples were collected via an institutional biorepository. An organotypic slice culture model was developed by creating 200 &micro;m thick sections and maintaining them in culture media (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin and streptomycin). Cell viability was assessed with a calcein-based commercial assay, and a proliferation assay was performed by incubating slices in EdU for 5-7 days and then quantifying fluorescence with confocal microscopy. Drug studies were separately performed by maintaining slices in culture and dosing daily with DMSO (control) or TAK-981, a selective inhibitor of SUMOylation (treatment), for seven days. Tumor slices were then dissociated, and cell populations were quantified with flow cytometry and immunostaining.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We assayed 3 distinct patient tumor samples for proliferation and utilized 3 separate samples for treatment with TAK-981. Cell viability was &gt;60-80% after 7 days in culture, and EdU labeled tumor slices showed evidence of proliferation over 5-7 days (mean 89.2 Edu+ cells/1000, n = 3). As expected, the epithelial tumor cell content of the tumors was less than 10% and slices were largely composed of immune cell populations. Flow cytometry revealed the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, Treg, and macrophages in all tumor samples. Of the immune cells, 34.7%-75.1% were derived from T-cell lineages. The specific proportions of cell types were heterogenous across tumor samples. When treated with TAK-981, all three samples showed decreased total cell viability and immune cell viability. In two out of three samples, TAK-981 treatment was associated with a two to three-fold decrease in Treg populations.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We show that an organotypic slice culture model of human appendiceal mucinous neoplasms exhibits cell proliferation and high viability. The TIME of organotypic slices is diverse, active, and responsive to targeted drug therapy. SUMOylation inhibition may decrease immunosuppression within the TIME by influencing the Treg population.

While extensively studied, the mechanistic details of this process are poorly understood. Previous investigations involved experimental metastasis (EM) models wherein tumor cells are intravenously injected, eliminating the possibility for tumor cells to undergo conditioning by factors arising at the primary tumor site. Further, technological limitations had precluded longitudinal, single-cell resolution imaging of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) that arrive to the secondary site, allowing only for speculation regarding their behavior. The advent of the Window for High Resolution Imaging of the Lung (WHRIL) makes it now possible to definitively determine DTC fate in vivo. Using intravital imaging via the WHRIL, fates of DTCs in the EM and the spontaneous metastasis (SM) models (where tumor cells spontaneously disseminate from an orthotopic tumor) were compared, revealing more rapid extravasation among SM cells. This suggests that primary site signaling induces expression of proteins conveying trans-endothelial migration ability. To test this possibility, we examined DTCs of both models for the expression of Mena<sup>INV</sup>, an isoform of the actin regulatory protein, Mena, previously shown to be important for tumor cell intravasation within the primary tumor. Immunohistochemistry revealed that SM cells, compared to EM cells, markedly overexpressed Mena<sup>INV</sup>. Further, induced Mena<sup>INV </sup>overexpression in EM cells resulted in more rapid extravasation, approaching rates observed among SM cells. To identify other proteins regulating secondary site extravasation, we reasoned that, since EM cells eventually do extravasate, albeit in a delayed manner, expression of those proteins required for extravasation (e.g. Mena<sup>INV</sup>) are activated later, only after DTC arrival at the secondary site.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: To identify additional proteins involved in extravasation, we performed EM using GFP labeled tumor cells. Mice were sacrificed at various time points after injection to permit increasing extravasation events with each successive group. Following sacrifice, lungs were removed and enzymatically dissociated to generate a single cell suspension, enabling tumor cell isolation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among EM cells, 0% extravasated after 8 hrs, 50% extravasated after 24 hrs and 100% extravasated after 48 hrs. Expression profiles from each group were then compared (via bulk RNA-seq) to guide targets for manipulation, after which DTC fates were measured through the WHRIL.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We report the identification of genes differentially regulated as tumor cells cross the lung endothelium, as well as the impact that manipulation of these genes has on the steps of the metastatic cascade.

Unfortunately the majority of Hsp90 inhibitors developed to date failed in clinical trials due to dose limiting toxicities, in part from their activation of the heat shock response. Cruentaren A (CA), is an extremely rare naturally-derived small molecule that selectively (&gt;500 fold against cancer cells) inhibits the F1Fo ATP synthase and its native interaction with Hsp90&alpha; , resulting in dual inhibition of both Hsp90 and ATP production. Due to its rarity in nature, we have developed novel synthetic analogs for CA and hypothesize that these compounds will target energy metabolism in cancer cells through disruption Hsp90/F1Fo ATP synthase interactions, inhibition of ATP and the glycolytic enzymes needed to sustain the Warburg effect.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: CA analogs were screened for growth inhibition in cancer cells (MCF7, A549, K562) using the CellTiter Glo assay. Seahorse Machine was used to measure extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation on the basis of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) after treatment of MCF7 and A549 cells with the lead CA analogs and analyzed using Wave 2.6 software. Changes in glycolytic pathway genes were analyzed by RT-PCR.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Screening of 35 CA analogs in multiple cancer cells identified NDC33 and NDC34 as lead anticancer analogs. Inhibitory growth concentration(GI50) in MCF7, A549, and K562 cells was 4.672, 0.75, and 1.5nM for NDC33 and 74.39, 27.25, and 57.52nM for NDC34 respectively. Seahorse experiment showed a significant decrease in basal OCR rate for both NDC33 (A549=80.18%,MCF7=82.96%) and NDC34 (A549=83.06%,MCF7=86.3%) with p &lt;0.001 vs controls. We also observed a &gt;50% decrease in proton leak, ATP production, maximum respiratory OCR, and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption for both NDC33 and NDC34 (p&lt;0.001 vs. controls). Evaluation of ECAR also showed a significant (p&lt;0.001) decrease in glycolysis for NDC33 (A549=65.14%, MCF7= 59.75%) and NDC34 (A549=76.3%, MCF7=50.9%). Down regulation of glycolysis also decreased glycolytic reserve, glycolytic capacity, and non-glycolytic acidification after treatment of A549 and MCF7 with lead CA compounds. Analysis of glycolytic genes by RT PCR showed down-regulation of HIF-1&alpha; (&gt;90%), PKM1 and 2 (&gt; 60-80%), PFK1 (60-70%), Glut1 (&gt;50%), HK2 (50-80%) and MCT4 (20-40%) after treatment of MCF7, A549 and K562 with NDC33 and 34 all with a p-value of &lt;0.01 vs controls.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We identified two novel CA analogs that effectively inhibit cancer cells by targeting energy metabolism by downregulating OCR, ECAR and glycolytic genes. This exciting target and mechanism of action supports future in vivo validation studies to determine the potential clinical benefits of CA analogs in cancers.

Prostate cancer (CaP) is one of the top five causes of cancer in active-duty male service members with an incidence of 1046 cases between 2005 and 2014. Growing evidence indicates the involvement of a genetic component for CaP susceptibility and clinical severity. The goals of this study are to identify the common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TP53 gene in African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) men and to perform an association analysis for common germline variants in TP53 with clinico-pathological features of CaP. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

CPDR Oncoarray data on 321 men treated by radical prostatectomy at WRNMMC was used to perform clinco-pathological associations with TP53 SNPs. Pathological, demographics, treatment and progression data were obtained from the CPDR database. Genotype imputation analysis was performed using Eagle for phasing and Minimac4 for imputation with TOPMed as reference and chi-square test was used to compare distributions of demographic and clinico-pathologic characteristics across genotypes. Time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) or metastasis was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard modeling and Kaplan-Meier analysis.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

SNP genotyping analysis on the final cohort of 308 patients (AA, 212; CA, 95) using imputation identified 74 SNPs in the TP53 gene region with MAF of at least 1%. Two of the 74 SNPs are non-synonymous SNPs in the exonic region of TP53 - Pro47Ser and Pro72Arg. The Pro47Ser variant, has a minor allele frequency of 0.01 in African Americans while this variant was not detected in Caucasian Americans. Pro72Arg was found to be most common SNP with a minor allele frequency of 0.50 (AA, 0.41; CA, 0.68). TP53 Pro72Arg was found to be significantly associated with race, with C allele (Proline) being the major allele in Caucasian-American patients and G allele (Arginine) in African American patients. Imputed SNP Pro72Arg was further experimentally validated by ddPCR with 99.0% concordance.

Of the 308 patients, the mean age was 57 years (SD=9) and 228 (74%) of the cases were pathologic stage T2. There were 47 (15%) BCR events. The Pro72Arg SNP was found to be significantly associated with BCR following radical prostatectomy after adjusting for patient age at diagnosis, race, and Gleason score (HR = 1.52, P= 0.046). We did not observe any statistically significant association between the Pro72Arg or Pro47Ser polymorphism and prostate cancer aggressiveness or other pathologic variables.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The present study clearly demonstrated population-dependent differences in allele frequencies of p53 Pro72Arg or p53 Pro47Ser SNPs in AA and CA CaP, thereby providing a valuable framework for the interrogating CaP disparity among different ethnic groups in the military. Additionally, we found a weak association for p53 Pro72Arg for poor disease outcome. This improved understanding of the association between SNPs, ethnic groups, and CaP disease severity will allow military medical providers to improve screening tools and treatment methods for military personnel.

Leckenby<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Rochester, Surgery, Rochester, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is an impactful clinical entity affecting 30-70% of patients that often determines the length and dosage of cancer treatment. While an effective treatment against cancer cells, it also has an affinity for peripheral nerve fibers leading to dysfunction or degeneration in 50-70% of patients acutely and 30% of patients chronically. The Murphy Roths Large (MRL/MpJ) strain of mice have demonstrated resistance to scar formation and superior wound healing yet little is reported peripheral nerve regenerative outcomes. We have presented data to support the beneficial role that the MRL/MpJ strain has in improved peripheral nerve regeneration, and is likely linked to the activation of M2 macrophages &ndash; this has the potential to diminish the impact of CIPN by encouraging mechanistic responses to prevent the degradation of myelin. The degradation of myelin is one of, if not the crucial factor in developing CIPN. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the same principles that apply to peripheral nerve regeneration can prevent the development CIPN and open the door to exploring a direct translatable mechanistic approach.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A validated model of CIPN was used to compare two strains of mice, MRL/MpJ (experimental) and C57/BL6 (control). Both strains received paclitaxel (PTX) at a total dose of 8mg/kg administered at 2mg/kg for four doses on alternate days. Functional outcomes were recorded at baseline and weekly thereafter. These included testing for allodynia, heat and cold sensitivity; and were recorded at baseline and weekly until the 4<sup>th</sup> week. Baseline electrophysiological analysis was compared to the 4-week study endpoint. Sciatic nerves were harvested as controls from 4 mice prior to administration of PTX. At the 4-week end point sciatic nerves were harvested from both groups for analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Both strains failed to demonstrate significant deterioration in clinical functional outcomes. However, statistically significant differences were seen with the MRL/MpJ strain demonstrating no change in peak amplitude, latency, or velocity over the experimental period. However, the C57/BL6 strain demonstrated a significant increase in latency and a significant decrease in velocity, both directly implicate in CIPN. Furthermore, histologically MRL/MpJ mice demonstrated superior myelination at 4 weeks (g ratio) and significantly better circularity; both metrics of mitigation to CIPN.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study presents an exciting pathway towards the poorly understood mechanism of CIPN, however this needs to be replicated at human equivanent dosing (35mg/kg). The results open an exciting avenue to pursue a mechanistic approach to improve patient tolerance, and therefore survival of cancer treatment. The study presents a clear approach to investigating a potential molecular pathway that may mitigate the development of CIPN.

Breast cancer is associated with a hypercoagulable state and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is linked to a worse cancer prognosis. Despite malignancy being a known risk factor for hypercoagulability, methods to quantify the pro-thrombotic state and stratify individual patients are lacking. The goal of our study is to utilize whole blood thromboelastography (TEG) to quantify a hypercoagulable state in breast cancer murine models and patients, and to validate our murine model as a permissible mode of hypercoaguability in breast cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
MMTV-PyMT (polyoma middle-T antigen oncogene) transgenic mice which emulate human tumor staging develop spontaneous breast tumors starting at 4 weeks and progress to age &ge; 14 weeks with observable metastatic disease, and their age-matched control littermates, underwent cardiac puncture to obtain 400 mL whole blood mixed with 40 mL sodium citrate. TEG was performed on 340 mL citrated whole blood. Importantly, whole blood samples were also obtained from patients seen in our multi-disciplinary breast cancer clinic with newly diagnosed, untreated breast cancer after signing informed consent per our IRB approved protocol. Blood was collected in 2.7 mL citrated tubes and TEG was performed on citrated, native whole blood as described above. Values for R time (min), K time (min), &alpha;-angle (degrees), maximum amplitude (MA, mm), lysis at 30 minutes (Ly30, %), and coagulation index (CI) were recorded and analyzed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
In the spontaneous murine model of breast cancer, stage IV tumor-bearing mice had a significantly elevated MA compared to normal age-matched controls (81.46 &plusmn; 0.77 vs 75.01 &plusmn; 0.80, p=0.00001). Additionally, the CI, an aggregate measure of coagulation, was significantly elevated in the stage IV mice compared with age-matched controls (5.37 &plusmn; 0.14 vs 4.56 &plusmn; 0.17, p=0.0018). In patients, the correlative samples demonstrated an elevated CI above normal limits in 25% of breast cancer patients (2 of 8), consistent with hypercoagulability. Both of these patients had corresponding elevated MA, suggesting a platelet driven hypercoagulable state. Interestingly, one of these patients was the only patient in our cohort who had node positive disease.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

These preliminary data suggests that a hypercoagulable state can be detected in both murine and human breast cancer utilizing TEG. This hypercoagulable state appears largely driven by enhanced platelet function given the corresponding increase in MA. We aim to further interrogate our murine model by assessing mice at the previous three characterized stages of disease and expanding our patient cohort to validate trends in the hypercoagulable state in regionally metastatic nodal disease and link TEG findings to other clinically relevant end points. Further research is warranted.

Tube thoracostomy is a common procedure for which competency is expected of all general surgery residents. Although general surgery residents have fewer complications than other resident specialties; complications relating to position and insertion are reported. We hypothesized with the use of our novel chest tube placement device, placement efficiency and positioning will improve compared to the open Kelly clamp technique across general surgery resident levels.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A swine model lab was conducted through an IACUC device testing approved protocol. After a pre-procedure tutorial general surgery residents placed chest tubes with the device and Kelly clamps through pre-determined incision sites. Time to placement was compared using paired t-tests. Placement positioning was determined by a post-placement chest x-ray. One way ANOVA was used for intra-technique comparisons; P- values of &lt;0.05 were considered significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of seven general surgery residents including post-graduate year (PGY) 1-4 participated. Overall device use resulted in faster chest tube placement compared with the Kelly clamp technique (37.3 seconds vs 50.8 seconds, p = 0.011). Time to placement was significant within PGY with device use (p&lt;0.01) while not significant with Kelly use (p=0.681). All device placed chest tubes were in the apical position (N= 28) compared to 64% of Kelly placed chest tubes (N= 18). Intrathoracic placement using the device was 89% (N=25) compared to 96% (N= 27) using the Kelly technique.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
In this proof of concept device testing lab all general surgery residents placed chest tubes in an apical position and with an overall increased speed when using the novel device compared to the Kelly clamps. This study has spurred additional device testing focused on how general surgery residents learn and use the device.

Cox<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Health Science Center At Houston, Department Of Pediatric Surgery, Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Few therapeutic options exist to treat chronic neuroinflammation after traumatic brain injury (TBI). As potent immunomodulators, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) hold significant promise for attenuating TBI-associated neuroinflammation. Much of MSC&rsquo;s immunosuppressive effects arise due to proinflammatory cytokine exposure. This inflammatory licensing promotes the secretion of soluble factors that dampen immune responses and direct lymphocyte differentiation. This work shows that mechanotransduction is a means of pre-conditioning that enhances the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors independent of cytokines. Moreover, MSC inflammatory licensing is enhanced after WSS exposure.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Wharton Jelly-derived MSC (WJ-MSC) were expanded until passage four in culture plastic with complete culture media (CCM) consisting of a-MEM, human platelet lysate, GlutaMax, and gentamicin. Then, WJ-MSC were plated within a parallel-plate bioreactor or tissue culture flasks. Adherent cells in the bioreactor were exposed to a wall shear stress (WSS) of 8 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> for 3 hours. Conditioned WJ-MSC (WSS-MSC) and statically cultured WJ-MSC (Static-MSC) were seeded in 6-well plates with CCM alone or CCM containing cytokines associated with inflammatory licensing (TNF-&alpha; , IFN-&gamma; , IL-1b, or all three). The supernatants&rsquo; concentrations of the therapeutic markers prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were measured via ELISA. The MSC groups were co-cultured with mitogen-activated rat splenocytes. Immunosuppressive potential was assayed by quantifying TNF-&alpha; or IFN-&gamma; concentrations in the supernatant relative to activated splenocyte monocultures. An elidot-style cytokine array assessed the presence of inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukins) in supernatants. Differences (p &lt; 0.05) were determined by one or two-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The production of the anti-inflammatory mediators PGE<sub>2</sub> and HO-1 was independently enhanced by WSS. Also, WSS-MSC secreted greater amounts of PGE<sub>2</sub> and HO-1 upon cytokine stimulation. In the Splenocyte Co-Culture assay, WSS-MSC suppressed TNF-&alpha; production by LPS-stimulated splenocytes to a greater degree than Static-MSC. WSS-MSC and Static-MSC suppressed IFN-&gamma; secretion by ConA-stimulated splenocytes in a similar fashion. The protein array of cytokine-stimulated WSS-MSC showed decreased inflammatory markers and enhanced anti-inflammatory markers relative to cytokine-stimulated Static-MSC.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: WSS enhances WJ-MSC immunomodulatory potential independently of cytokine exposure. However, the biomechanical force primes WJ-MSC for inflammatory licensing so that cytokine stimulation elicits a stronger anti-inflammatory MSC phenotype.

Approximately thirty million people in the United States suffer from diabetes. The prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in this population is 13%. Current standard of care wound dressings are passive and cannot actively respond to variations in the wound environment. Smart bandages are well positioned to address these challenges. To our knowledge there have not been significant advancements in incorporating sensing technologies to deliver active wound care. We believe this can be achieved using a multidisciplinary approach combining electrical and chemical engineering with the fundamentals of cellular and biomolecular processes in wound healing directed towards high resolution, in situ tissue regeneration.

Materials and Methods

A flexible printed wireless stimulator was designed and fabricated to deliver directional energy across a wound gradient. Subsequently a low impedance PEDOT:PSS electrode was designed to optimize the skin and stimulator interface, producing a robust gel with tunable adhesion properties. The smart bandage was evaluated in an excisional diabetic and C57BL6/J murine wound healing model. A parabiosis model was used to evaluate circulating cell migration into the wound bed. Single cell analyses were performed to evaluate changes in cell populations as a direct result of induced electrical stimulation. In vitro validation was performed to elucidate in vivo results.

Results and Discussion

Wireless electrical stimulation resulted in significantly accelerated wound closure, when compared to controls, in both a diabetic and C57BL6/J murine excisional wound healing model. Complete epidermal recovery was observed, with a thicker collagen network and increased dermal thickness. Greater neovascularization and appendage formation were observed in the treatment groups. Single cell analyses revealed higher proliferation and remodeling regulatory markers expressed across treated groups. In vitro co-culture validation experiments demonstrated accelerated proliferation, mitotic rate and tube formation when compared to controls.

Conclusion

Our data demonstrates the functionality of a robust wireless interface for wound healing. This novel treatment modality will integrate AI processing components for the development of a closed-loop functional stimulator. By combining the domain expertise of nanofabrication, mechanotransduction, fibrosis and molecular/cellular analyses, we are developing a novel chronically stable and robust smart bandage that will pave the way for the next generation of palliative wound care.

Pre-clinical models of sepsis and septic shock are critical to characterize response to resuscitation strategies, utility of novel devices and monitoring approaches, and determination of hemodynamic parameters. Though imperfect, a porcine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hypotension has been designed that decreased peripheral vascular resistance to approximate changes observed in sepsis. Little is reported on hemodynamic parameters during the course of sepsis and resuscitation. In this study, central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) specifically were assessed throughout induction of hypotension, with subsequent fluid and vasopressor-based resuscitation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Ten pigs were anesthetized, cannulated with a pulmonary artery catheter and equilibrated to a PCWP of ~10 mmHg. Pigs were infused with an escalating dose of IV LPS until a 25% decrement in systolic blood pressure was observed. Four subsequent 10 mg/kg crystalloid boluses were given, followed by a 30 minute uptitration of norepinephrine (NE) to 0.25 ug/kg/min. Hemodynamic parameters including CVP and PCWP were transduced at baseline, critical hypotension, after each bolus, and after the course of NE administration. Central tendency was expressed as median [interquartile range]. Differences among medians were determined using Wilcoxon or Friedman tests with post-hoc multiple comparisons, as appropriate.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
From baseline to critical hypotension, PCWP (10 [9-10] mmHg vs. 8 [6-9] mmHg; P=0.02) significantly declined, unlike CVP (5 [4-6] mmHg vs. 3 [1-5] mmHg; P=0.14). Compared to its value at critical hypotension (8 [6-9] mmHg), PCWP was elevated after the second (12 [11-14] mmHg; P=0.01), third (13 [11-19] mmHg; P&lt;0.001) and fourth (15 [10-18] mmHg; P&lt;0.001) boluses. Similarly, compared to its value at critical hypotension (3 [1-5] mmHg), CVP was elevated after the second (8 [5-11] mmHg; P=0.002), third (10 [6-13] mmHg; P&lt;0.001) and fourth (10 [8-15] mmHg; P&lt;0.001) boluses. PCWP decreased from post-boluses to post-NE infusion (15 [10-18] mmHg vs. 9 [8-12] mmHg; P=0.05). CVP also decreased from post-boluses to post-NE infusion (10 [8-15] mmHg vs. 4 [2-7] mmHg; P=0.02). During the course of NE infusion, however, there was significant progression of tachycardia (104 [95-119] bpm vs. 131 [126-153] bpm; P=0.004; see Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Key intravascular blood volume parameters PCWP and CVP were assessed in a porcine model of LPS-induced hypotension and resuscitation to approximate sepsis. Changes in CVP mimicked those of PCWP, and both decreased after a course of NE infusion. These values obtained from controlled experiments provide context for use of these resuscitation strategies in humans with distributive hypotension, though further studies are needed.

The Creatinine Height Index (CHI) is an estimate of lean body mass, derived from 24-hr urinary creatinine, adjusted for sex and height, and used as a nutritional assessment. It is hypothesized that creatinine excretion can be estimated using serum creatinine levels in patients with normal kidney function. If confirmed, this could be a simpler method to identify patients at nutritional risk by avoiding the difficulty of collecting 24-hr urine samples. Critically ill trauma patients are unlike their medical counterparts in that most are young and well-nourished at the time of injury and generally receive early, substantial fluid resuscitation. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether serum creatinine-based CHI (sCHI) estimates are accurate reflections when compared to 24-hr urine-based CHI (uCHI).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Blood samples were collected on initial presentation from adult surgical intensive care unit (SICU) bound trauma patients at a level-one trauma center from 3/1/2017-9/30/2019, and sCHIs were calculated using the serum creatinine levels. 24-hr urine collections were also started on all patients upon admission to the SICU. The cross-sectional area (area) and radiodensity of the psoas muscle at the L3 level were reported using CT scans on admission. Pearson&rsquo;s correlation test was used to evaluate the relationship between sCHI, uCHI, psoas muscle area, and radiodensity. All analyses were further adjusted for renal function and degree of stress after trauma as noted by the catabolic index (CI).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 45 trauma patients requiring admission to the SICU were included in the study. The study population was young (median age=31.9, IQR 24.8,50.7), suffered significant trauma (median ISS=25, IQR 17,35), and demonstrated high levels of stress on admission (median CI=3.8, IQR 0.2,7.5). The sCHI (mean=71.0%, SD=26.9%) is likely an underestimate of CHI due to overhydration as compared to that based on 24-hr urine collection (uCHI mean=112.5%, SD=32.6%); there was no correlation between sCHI and uCHI (r=0.068, p=0.69). After removing patients with renal dysfunction and stratifying by degrees of stress, there still was no correlation between sCHI and uCHI (r=0.026, p=0.91 for CI&gt;0). Interestingly, in patients without stress, there was a negative correlation between sCHI and psoas muscle area (r=-0.869, p=0.03), and in patients with severe stress there was a correlation between uCHI and psoas muscle area (r=0.733, p=0.016).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
sCHI is not an accurate estimate of uCHI in the setting of stress and associated catabolic state following significant trauma with fluid resuscitation. uCHI is likely an overestimate due to elevated catabolism and sCHI an underestimate due to vascular expansion associated with resuscitation. Although psoas muscle mass on presentation correlates with uCHI during severe stress, this most likely reflects proportional catabolic increases of creatinine excretion in relation to initial muscle mass.

Most gyrencephalic models of brain injury focus on parenchymal injury, with no models of acutely elevated ICP. The aim of this study is to develop a swine model of titratable ICP for neurotrauma brain perfusion research.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Six swine (35-45kg) were anesthetized and instrumented with hemodynamic and ICP monitoring. A Fogarty balloon catheter was inserted intracranially via a burr hole and connected to a computer-controlled infusion pump, accurate to 0.01 mL. Blood CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure was maintained between 35 and 45 mmHg. The Fogarty balloon was infused with normal saline at 1 mL/min to ICP targets of 10, 20, 30, and 40 mmHg. CBF (mL/100g/min) was assessed at each ICP level using computed tomography perfusion (CTP) scanning. Data are presented as mean &plusmn; standard deviation with all pressures measured in mmHg. CBF values were compared between baseline and each ICP level using analysis of variance.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Baseline ICP was 5 &plusmn; 2 and systolic blood pressure was 106 &plusmn; 7. Balloon volumes (mL) required to achieve each incremental ICP level were 2.4 &plusmn; 0.5, 4.9 &plusmn; 1.7, 7.6 &plusmn; 1.6, and 9.9 &plusmn; 1.7. CBF decreased with each raised ICP level (Figure 1), with CBF being significantly less than baseline at ICP values of 30 (56.1 &plusmn; 34.7 vs. 20.6 &plusmn; 11.0, p &lt; 0.05) and 40 (56.1 &plusmn; 34.7 vs. 6.5 &plusmn; 10.6, p &lt; 0.05).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: An intracranial Fogarty balloon catheter can be used to increase ICP, delivering a proportionate reduction in CBF. This model can be employed in future studies examining the effect of novel therapeutic adjuncts for raised ICP.

Current evidence suggests that abnormal coagulation is associated with PHI, and that fibrinolysis, indicated by the presence of elevated D-dimer, may have a role in the pathophysiology of PHI. The effect of the anti-fibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) on serum D-dimer levels over time and on the prevention of PHI has not been extensively explored. We hypothesize that in patients with TBI, treatment with TXA would result in a significantly greater decrease in D-dimer concentrations over time compared to untreated patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a retrospective study of prospectively collected samples from a biobank. The bank was first screened for subjects with a blood sample taken on admission to the hospital and subsequently upon admission to the ICU. Of these, 76 patients met the inclusion criteria of highest-level trauma activation, &ge;16 years old, admitted within 2 hours of injury, and TBI based on intracranial hemorrhage on initial CT. PHI was determined from radiology reports of a CT subsequent to the admission CT. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate change of D-dimer from admission to 6 hours. Comparisons between TXA yes and no groups were evaluated by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and Fisher&rsquo;s exact test for categorical variables. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: D-dimer levels for all subjects on admission (median 8,466 ng/ml (IQR 2102, 14243)) were elevated above normal (&le;500 ng/ml) and were decreased (p&lt;0.001) on admission to the ICU (4,067 ng/ml (925, 9214)). Fifty-nine patients received TXA as a 1-gram bolus in the emergency department following the attainment of the initial blood sample, and a 1-gram TXA infusion over 8 hours. Seventeen patients were not treated. Demographics were similar between the groups. On admission there was no difference in the TEG lysis at 30 minutes (LY30), 1.6 (0.3, 4.5) and 1.2 (0.3, 2.2), TXA yes and no, respectively. The time between the initial and ICU samples were not different, 5.7 (5.6, 6.3) and 5.7 (5.5, 6.2) hours. Patients who received TXA had a 39% reduction in serum D-dimer over 6 hours from 8263 (2533, 14365) to 4119 (888, 9184) ng/ml, while patients who did not receive TXA had a 28% reduction, 9394 (1921, 13196) to 3008 (1615, 9925) ng/ml. This difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.08). Of the patients that received TXA, 37.3% had PHI and of the patients that did not receive TXA, 35.3% had PHI on repeat imaging (p=1.00).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In patients with TBI, D-dimer levels are elevated on admission and decrease over 6 hours. In this cohort, early administration of TXA did not significantly potentiate the reduction of D-dimer levels over 6 hours compared to untreated patients, or reduce the incidence of PHI. The purported beneficial effects of TXA in patients with TBI appear associated with a mechanism other than attenuation of hyperfibrinolysis.

Ayala<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Brown University, Providence, RI, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Rhode Island Hospital, Division Of Surgical Research, Department Of Surgery, Providence, RI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Neonatal sepsis is a significant global health issue (present in up to 1-10/1000 of live births) and remains the leading cause of death among neonates worldwide. While the impact of sepsis in the adult population has been studied extensively, resulting in multiple iterations of a consensus definition and recommendations for diagnosis and management of the septic patient, no such consensus definition or widely agreed upon recommendations exist for neonates. V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) is an immune checkpoint regulator with predominantly suppressive effects on various immune and tumor cells. It is believed to play a similar, though nonredundant, role as PD-1 ? the most extensively studied member of the checkpoint inhibitor family. Further, PD-1 knockout neonates have been shown to have improved survival after septic insult. Inasmuch, our goal is to examine the effect of VISTA on the neonatal response to sepsis and its impact on morbidity and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Wildtype (C57BL6) and VISTA knockout (-/-) neonates underwent intraperitoneal injection of cecal slurry (CS, 1.17 mg slurry/g body weight) or saline (sham) at 5-7 days of life. Neonates were either observed for 7 days for survival or euthanized at 24 hours following this procedure for tissue harvest. Samples were processed on the day of harvest for flow cytometry analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: VISTA -/- neonates trend towards a survival deficit after CS as compared to WT (35% vs 50% at 7 days, n=20-40/group, p=0.3165 [Log-rank survival test]). On flow cytometry analysis of the thymus, WT pups demonstrate a decrease in CD4+ (9.1% vs 0.1%, p=0.2188) and CD4+CD8+ (53.4% vs 5.5%, p=0.0061) T-cells with a concomitant increase in CD8+ cells (5.9% vs 29.6%, p=0.0189) at 24 hours after septic insult. VISTA -/- pups show no such changes.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although both PD-1 and VISTA are considered primarily inhibitory or suppressive checkpoint proteins, they appear to have opposite effects on mortality following sepsis in neonates, suggesting that they play more distinct roles in the immune response than previously believed. In the thymus, we see significant differences in T-cell profile between WT and VISTA -/- neonates. While WT thymus samples have a shift from a large population of double positive T-cells to CD8+ T-cells, the proportions of CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+CD8+ T-cells remain relatively stable in VISTA -/- after sepsis. This suggests that VISTA may play a role in the differentiation and mobilization of T-cells from the thymus that may contribute to developing morbidity of these animals.

Wade<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>McGovern Medical School, Department Of Surgery, Houston, TX, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Center for Translational Injury Research, Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Sepsis is a heterogeneous disease with different biological mechanisms, clinical manifestations, and outcomes. The Sepsis Endotyping in Emergency Care (SENCA) project identified four phenotypes (Types 1-4) using routine clinical data available on hospital presentation. Phenotyping classification allowed identification of possible benefit of previous failed therapeutic interventions within subtypes. Endotheliopathy of trauma (EOT) shortly after admission is associated with subsequent sepsis and worse outcomes. We hypothesized that EOT on admission would be associated with SENCA sepsis phenotypes determine at the time of onset of sepsis. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
From a single center database of 611 trauma patients evaluated for EOT, from 2012 to 2018, we identified patients who developed sepsis. Based on clinical data from medical records at sepsis presentation, they were divided into the 4 phenotypes defined by the SENCA project. Following sepsis type identification, admission data, including biomarkers of EOT, sydecan-1 (Syn-1) and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), were compared using Phenotype 1 as a reference, since it was previously shown to have the best outcomes. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare medians. Fisher&rsquo;s exact test was used to compare all-cause mortality rates.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 51 patients who developed sepsis, the distribution of phenotypes was 14 (27%) Type 1, 6 (12%) Type 2, 8 (16%) 3 and 23 (45%) Type 4. On admission, compared to Type 1, Type 2 was older, and had a lower ACT (p=0.03) indicative of an absence of hyper-coagulation. Both Type 3 and 4 had lower pH values (p=0.04). The biomarkers of EOT for Type 1 were within normal limits. Compared to Type 1, there was an increase in sTM (p&lt;0.001) in Type 2 indicative of endothelial activation, while Type 3 had an elevation of Syn1 (p&lt;0.001) associated with shedding of the glycocalyx. Type 4 presented with an increase in both Syn-1 and sTM (p&lt;0.001). All-cause mortality was 29% Type 1, 33% Type 2, 12% Type 3 and 49% Type 4 (NS).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Trauma patients who develop sepsis are separable into four phenotypes at the time of sepsis onset using routine clinical data. The type and degree of EOT at the time of admission may be used to identify the subsequent sepsis phenotype and guide therapeutic interventions.

Clinical trials in septic shock patients can be challenging due to differential manifestations and outcomes. Septic shock has been shown to cause endothelial dysfunction, evidenced by syndecan-1 (Syn-1), which has been stabilized by plasma resuscitation in animal models. In this pilot trial, halted prematurely due to low patient accrual, we hypothesized that treatment with fresh frozen plasma would decrease the inflammatory response to sepsis, as evidenced by decreased levels of Syn-1 (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03366220). 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single-center randomized, controlled trial was performed in trauma and emergency general surgery patients from March 2018 to July 2020. Patients were enrolled with a Sepsis Screening Score &ge;4 and suspected infection. Patients were randomized to crystalloid resuscitation or plasma resuscitation if septic shock developed, defined by MAP &lt;65mmHg or ongoing pressor use, lactic acid &gt;2.2, altered mental status, or decreased urine output &lt;0.5mL/kg in the past one hour. Initial bolus was standardized (crystalloid 30mL/kg, plasma 10mL/kg), and following boluses were left to physician discretion. Plasma biomarker Syn-1 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at time of randomization and at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours after treatment. Univariate analyses were performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 16 patients enrolled, 8 patients were randomized: 50% to crystalloid resuscitation and 50% to plasma resuscitation. Median age was 45 (IQR 34-57) and 63% had a respiratory source of sepsis. Initial heart rate, hemoglobin, and lactate were similar between groups. Mortality (25%) was similar between groups. Patients randomized to plasma resuscitation had lower Syn-1 prior to treatment (Figure 1). After accounting for baseline Syn-1, there were no observed differences between those treated with crystalloid and those treated with plasma at all measured time points. At the primary end-point of 6 hours, patients treated with crystalloid had a median change in Syn-1 of -22.8ng/mL (IQR -112.0 to 80.4) while those treated with plasma had a change in Syn-1 of 20.4 (-4.0 to 36.6), p=1.0.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This pilot trial demonstrates the challenges in conducting randomized trials on patients with sepsis. Heterogeneity in clinical and biochemical manifestations of sepsis may result in variable treatment effects. Accurate tools for stratifying patients at risk for poor outcomes are necessary in order to study promising interventions. Biochemical markers of endotheliopathy show promise as a tool for this purpose. In this pilot trial, we observed no difference in treatment effect between groups treated with crystalloid and plasma. Further studies are needed to better characterize patients that may benefit from this intervention.

Zuckerbraun<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Department Of Surgery, Pittsburgh, PENNSYLVANIA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The growing size of the aging population presents unique challenges to healthcare. Accumulation of stressors and changes in disease-independent domains converge to produce an increased burden of disease. Immunometabolic dysfunction is thought to underly these changes. Metformin is an insulin-sensitizing agent that has also demonstrated salutary effects in slowing the progression of age-related chronic diseases and decreasing all-cause mortality. Our lab has previously demonstrated rescue of several immunometabolic defects of aging by metformin in a murine model of aging with surgical infectious stress. We now seek to characterize the transcriptomic changes at the single cell level induced by metformin that may underly these protective effects. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Aged (20 months) and young adult (8-12 week) wild-type (C57Bl/6) male mice were randomized to treatment with metformin (250 mg/kg/day) or water control for 2 weeks. Mice were then randomized to cecal ligation-puncture (CLP) or no surgery (n=8 per group). At 8 hours, whole blood was harvested by cardiac puncture. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by standard Ficoll centrifugation. Single-cell cDNA libraries were prepared following 10x Genomics protocol and paired-end sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform. Raw sequencing data was processed using the 10x Genomics CellRanger pipeline to generate a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) matrix and further processed using the Seurat (v2.3.4) R package. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on variable genes. Based on significant PCs, UMAP and clustering analyses were performed to identify biologically-meaningful clusters. Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between clusters were computed using the FindMarkers function based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. DEGs showing a Bonferroni&rsquo;s method- adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 were considered significant and used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. For cell populations of interest (i.e. T Cells), we removed the UMI count submatrix and repeated the secondary analysis to analyze differences in these populations at higher resolution. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Transcriptome profiles were analyzed for a PBMCs from a total of 16 mice. Clustering analysis demonstrated notable changes in clustering after metformin exposure in CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes among aged mice with or without surgical infectious stress (Figure 1). DEG analysis identified a group of 10 genes that were upregulated in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells from aged mice with metformin pre-treatment subjected to CLP. Gene ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated association of these genes with immune cell localization, particularly T-helper 1 cell (T<sub>h</sub>1) diapedesis and natural killer (NK) cell chemotaxis, as well as regulation of mitochondrial electron transport.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This investigation supplements our work to date by suggesting several functional parameters of immune cells that may be augmented by metformin and rescue immunometabolic defects of aging. Future study will include functional analysis to validate these findings.

Del Pin<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>North Shore University And Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Surgery, Manhasset, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: During the Covid-19 pandemic, wound care remains a key part of patient care. Many studies discuss the transmission of SARS Cov-2 by droplet, contact, stool and aerosol. However there have been no reports of SARS Cov -2 in wound drainage from acute or chronic injuries.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Nine positive COV-2 patients&rsquo; wounds (men=5) were sampled between April-July 2020 at Long Island Jewish Hospital, NY. Patient and IRB approval was obtained. Urgent viral RT-PCR was available on site. BD Universal viral transport with flocked flexible mini tip swab with 3 ml medium (Beckton, Dickinson and Co., Sparks MD, USA) was used to test the wounds at dermis, subcutaneous and muscle level. SARS COV-2 testing platforms included Genmarke plex (PCR) and or Xepheid Xpert (PCR) assay Abbot, modified CDC PCR.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: All nine patient&rsquo;s wound RT-PCR were negative for SARS COV-2. The patients&rsquo; mean age was 63years, and the wound types included pressure ulcer (PU) ((sacral n=3), buttock (n=2), ischial (n=1)), two leg ulcers ((venous ulcer (n=1), surgical incision &amp; drainage site (n=1)), tracheostomy site (n=1) . Four of the wounds were chronic. One case had continued positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR beyond 65days.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In hospitalized patients with SARS COV-2, no virus was detected by viral RT- PCR in wound tissue. Personal protective equipment is required for health care providers due to a potential prolonged infectious period in some cases. A larger wound sample size, temporal relationship between therapeutic anti- viral interventions, and the nasopharyngeal and stool replication viral loads needs warrants further investigation.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Prospective, observational, multicenter study of adults (age &ge; 18) with confirmed or suspected AP or AC. Patients were categorized as pre-pandemic (Pre-CoV: October 2019-January 2020), or during the first pandemic peak (CoV: April 2020 through local end of pandemic restrictions). A general estimating equation logistic regression adjusted for age, BMI, and sex and accounting for clustering by study site was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for the association between temporal period and use of non-operative management (NOM) or initial operative approach (laparoscopic vs open).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 2,159 patients were included from 19 participating centers. All baseline demographics (age, gender, weight, co-morbidities) were similar between groups. For both diseases, the duration of symptoms from symptom onset to ED triage was similar (AP: 24 [12-48] h vs. 24 [12-48] h, p=.337; AC: 24 [12-72] h vs. 24 [12-72] h; p=.809). However, Pre-CoV patients were less likely to have simple, uncomplicated AP or AC compared to CoV (AP: AAST Image Grade 1 55% vs. 82%, p&lt;.001; AC AAST Image Grade 1 74% vs. 88%, p&lt;.001). Compared to Pre-CoV, CoV patients were more likely to have severe disease and less likely to be operated on by an Acute Care surgeon. For CoV AC patients, NOM was twice as likely compared to Pre-CoV (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.09-3.62), but there was no difference in the likelihood of laparoscopy (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.38-1.60). For AP, there was no difference in the likelihood of NOM (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.48-1.99), but initial laparoscopic approach was 87% less likely in CoV patients (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.74) among those undergoing surgery. Mortality, length of stay, disposition, complications, secondary interventions, and reoperation were not significantly different between CoV and Pre-CoV (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: During the COVID-19 pandemic, disease severity at presentation was significantly worse. Cholecystitis patients were more often initially managed without surgery and appendectomies were less often attempted laparoscopically. Patient-centered clinical outcomes were not significantly different between groups.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent cause of preventable harm among surgical patients. Despite evidence supporting VTE prophylaxis, many prescribed doses are not administered to hospitalized patients. We previously demonstrated a patient-centered education bundle (PEB) intervention improves the administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis broadly; however, patient-specific factors associated with non-administration are unclear. We sought to describe the effects of a PEB on missed doses of VTE prophylaxis by sex.

Methods

We performed post-hoc analyses of a nonrandomized controlled pre-intervention and intervention trial to evaluate the differences in missed doses of VTE prophylaxis by sex. We compared pre-intervention and intervention periods for patients admitted to 16 surgical and medical units, from October 2014 to March 2015 (pre-intervention) and from April to December 2015 (intervention). A real-time alert was generated to a pager held by a nurse educator when a prescribed dose of VTE prophylaxis was not administered. Patients on four study units received a PEB (intervention) delivered by the nurse educator, while patients on 12 control units received no intervention. The conditional odds of (1) overall missed doses, (2) missed doses due to patient refusal, and (3) missed doses for other reasons, were stratified by patient sex.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Overall 16,862 patients were included (pre-intervention 6,852, PEB 10,010). On PEB units, 2,460 female and 2,349 male patients were included, while on control units 5,682 female and 6,371 male patients were included. The conditional odds of any missed dose significantly reduced on PEB units during PEB implementation vs. pre-intervention among female (OR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.46-0.76, p&lt;0.001) and male (OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45-0.76, p&lt;0.001) patients. Similar significant reductions were observed for missed doses due to patient refusal (p&lt;0.001), but not for missed doses for all reasons other than refusal (p&gt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

VTE prophylaxis administration improved for both female and male patients following PEB implementation, driven by decreases in patient refusal. Quality improvement interventions that utilize patient education should be relatable to a wide variety of patient demographics representative of the target population. Analyses of quality improvement efforts should also assess their effects by patient demographics and drivers of difference in care to better refine future interventions.

Acute biliary disease is a common reason for evaluation by general surgeons. In our healthcare system, the first COVID-19 surge mandated changes that deferred non-urgent operations in an effort to conserve resources. It is unknown how Covid-19 impacted presentation and outcomes of acute biliary disease during the pandemic. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective cohort study of all patients presenting to our emergency department (ED) with biliary colic, acute calculous cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and gallstone pancreatitis were evaluated at a large tertiary center during over ninety days during the first surge (March 10<sup>th</sup> to June 8<sup>th</sup>, 2020). The same time period in 2019 was used for historical control. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
ED presentation for acute biliary disease decreased by 38.1% (60 versus 97) during the pandemic when compared to the year prior (Figure 1). Although equal proportions were admitted (98.3% during the pandemic versus 95.9% prior to the pandemic, p=0.39), there were fewer same-admission surgeries during the pandemic compared to the control group (30.7% versus 43.2%, p=0.12) and a significant increase in percutaneous cholecystostomy placement (23.3% versus 6.2% p=0.002). Patients also reported longer duration of symptoms prior to presentation during the pandemic (3 days versus 1 day, p=0.001). After treatment, there were fewer 30-day readmissions (1.7% versus 10.3%, p=0.04) and complication rates (1.7% versus 13.4%, p=0.01) during the pandemic compared to controls. Of patients who did not undergo surgery during their admission during the pandemic, 36.6% eventually had surgery in the outpatient setting. Overall, whether inpatient or outpatient, 56.7% had surgical intervention for biliary disease during the pandemic compared to 58.8% (p=0.80).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Fewer patients presented during the COVID-19 pandemic with biliary disease, and they waited longer to present. As a consequence of this and hospital policy, during the pandemic fewer patients underwent surgery at index presentation, and there was a corresponding decrease in complications and readmissions. The pandemic has not only affected patients&#39; behaviors for seeking healthcare, but also, combined with the diversion of resources, delayed standard of care treatment for symptomatic gallstone disease. Despite this, a similar proportion of patients ultimately underwent surgery, and patients did not have worse outcomes, suggesting this is a safe temporizing alternative during this pandemic.

Holder-Murray<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Department Of Surgery, Pittsburgh, PENNSYLVANIA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PENNSYLVANIA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Anorectal abscesses affect nearly 100,000 patients annually in the United States. Previous studies have suggested that post-incision and drainage (I&amp;D) management (I.e., drain placement, packing, or leaving the wound open) does not affect abscess recurrence or fistula formation, yet there is no consensus on the optimal method. The purpose of this study was to define current practices in anorectal abscess management and identify factors that contribute to abscess recurrence and fistula formation. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Index episodes of anorectal abscesses treated with I&amp;D between 2014-2018 at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and affiliated hospitals were captured using appropriate procedure codes. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, hidradenitis, prior anorectal surgery or malignancy, pelvic radiation, supralevator abscesses, necrotizing infections, or those with persistent abscesses after their index I&amp;D were excluded. Demographics, comorbidities, and intraoperative variables are presented as mean&plusmn;standard deviation or frequency (%). The association between post-I&amp;D wound care and one-year outcomes was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazard regression clustered on year of procedure; adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were generated with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The primary outcome was abscess recurrence. Fistula formation was evaluated among patients without a fistula identified at the index operation. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 458 patients (age 47&plusmn;15.9 years, male n=302 [65.9%], white n=374 [81.7%]) met study criteria and included 304 (66.4%) perianal, 98 (21.4%) ischiorectal, 31 (6.8%) intersphincteric, and 25 (5.5%) horseshoe abscesses. Post-I&amp;D wound care consisted of packing (n=266, 58.1%), drain placement (n=112, 24.4%), or neither (n=80, 17.5%). Concurrent fistulae were identified in 105 (22.9%) patients. One-year abscess recurrence (n=68, 14.8%) was not associated with post-I&amp;D wound care method (compared to packing, drain aHR=1.3 [95%CI 0.91-1.85] and neither packing/drain aHR=0.53, [95%CI 0.24-1.21]). When compared to drainage at the bedside, drainage in the operating room was associated with a significantly reduced risk of abscess recurrence (aHR 0.23 [95%CI 0.11-0.47]). Among those without a fistula at the index operation, operating room drainage was also associated with a reduced risk of fistula formation (aHR=0.22 [95%CI 0.10-0.47]). Higher comorbidity indices were not associated with an increased risk of abscess recurrence or fistula formation (aHR 0.93 [95%CI 0.76-1.14] and 0.78 [95%CI 0.59-1.03], respectively). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our study corroborates previous findings that method of post-I&amp;D management does not influence abscess recurrence and fistula formation. Improved exposure and patient comfort in the operating room likely allow adequate drainage that contributes to the association between I&amp;D in the operating room and decreased rates of one-year abscess recurrence or fistula formation as compared to bedside management.

Zenilman<sup>1</sup>, R. Lee<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, Brooklyn, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically impacted the healthcare system in the United States. New York City was a major hotspot and hospitals had to close their operating rooms to allow reallocation of resources to care for the critically ill. Elective surgeries were canceled and many surgical diseases were treated nonoperatively due to concern for patient and staff safety and limited resources. In this study, we demonstrate that during the shutdown, operative management for acute appendicitis was safe and did not place additional strain on resources. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This single institution retrospective study focused on the incidence and outcome of acute appendicitis in the adult population (&gt;18yo) during the shutdown period (peak COVID) from 3/16/20-6/15/20 compared to pre and post COVID. We compared the number of patients who underwent operative vs non-operative management, patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), complications and readmission rates within these time periods. Data is presented as mean &plusmn; SD (ANOVA).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 1/1/2020 to 12/31/2020, 246 patients presented with acute appendicitis and 152 (88.4%) were treated operatively, compared to 227 total and 199 treated operatively (87.7%) in 2019. For patients that underwent surgery, there was no difference in LOS between the pre, peak, and post periods (mean 1.1&plusmn;0.9, 1.5&plusmn;1.3, 1.5&plusmn;1.8 respectively, p = 0.27). Additionally, there was no difference in 30-day readmission rates (6.8%, 0%, 3.7% respectively, p=0.4) and post-operative complications (6.8%, 0%, 0% respectively, p=0.07). During the COVID outbreak, fewer patients presented with appendicitis (mean 5.4&plusmn;2.1 pre, 2.2&plusmn;1.2 peak, 5.5&plusmn;1.5 post cases/week, p&lt;0.001) with no significant difference pre and post. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:During the shutdown period (peak-COVID), patients with acute appendicitis were safely treated with operative management. There was no difference in LOS, 30-day readmission, and post-operative complications rate. Concurrently, there was also a significant decrease in the incidence of acute appendicitis. At our institution, we had two running operating rooms for emergency cases, and because of the decreased incidence of acute appendicitis, we were able to safely manage it operatively without any additional strain placed on the system.

Velopulos<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, Surgery, Aurora, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted not only directly infected individuals, but has directly impacted the delivery of emergency general surgery (EGS) and contributed to widespread bed shortages for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. At our institution, a level 1 trauma center and tertiary referral center, rapid testing is not routinely approved for our EGS patients. We examined two common EGS conditions (appendicitis and acute cholecystitis) to observe this impact, hypothesizing that the necessity of testing for COVID, without offering rapid testing, delayed operative intervention significantly, contributing to need for admission during a time of hospital bed shortage.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a pre-post study examining a 3 month time period prior to COVID-19 testing (1/1/2020-3/1/2020) as a historical control, with a 3 month time period during the COVID era (1/1/2021-3/1/2021). We chose conditions that are typically surgically treated at our institution as outpatient/observation status. Exclusion criteria included initial decision for non-operative management and medical conditions requiring optimization/admission prior to surgery. We examined time for COVID test to result, and associated time to OR and need for admission.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Median time to COVID-19 test result was 7.4 hours [5.8, 13.1]. For appendectomy, time to surgery consultation did not differ between the groups (2.3 [1.7, 3.0] vs. 2.5 [1.0, 2.9] hours), neither did time to case request nor time to discharge after the OR (Table). Time to OR after case request and admission was several hours longer, all attributable to time waiting for COVID-19 test results. Importantly, more than 65% of patients were treated without admission in the pre-COVID-19 era, compared to less than 15% treated without admission during COVID-19 era. Similarly, for cholecystectomy time to OR after case request was 9.0 [4.2, 19.6] vs. 21.1 [15.3, 25.0], p=&lt;0.001, and time from admission to OR was 14.4 [8.3, 23.9] vs. 25.0 [19.9, 29.3], p=0.001.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While COVID-19 positivity rate remains high, routine testing remains necessary since COVID-19 positivity is associated with worse outcomes, and the decision for surgery is potentially affected by the results. Waiting for results directly impacts time to surgery, as well as the need for admission for historically outpatient procedures during a time of increasing bed shortages. Rapid testing should be routine for patients with EGS conditions.

Studies have shown that operating on COVID-19 patients increases postoperative mortality. However, few have quantified the factors associated with this risk. In this study, we hope to quantify the risk factors associated with COVID-19 in the surgical population during the initial outbreak in a community hospital in New York City. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
 

We analyzed a total of 227 patients who underwent surgical intervention. In this cohort, overall mortality was 7.5%. Mortality in the COVID-19 positive and negative subgroup are 23.1% and 4.5% respectively. Using multivariate analysis, the best fit model for our sample included age, sex, urgency of surgery, COVID-19 status, COPD, DM, HTN, CHF, CAD. We found mortality significantly associated with age, OR 1.12 per year (95% CI 1.06, 1.22) (p=0.001) and positive COVID-19 status, OR 9.378 (95% CI 2.41, 44.44) (p=0.002).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

 

This study included patients that underwent operative interventions during the peak of COVID-19 (2/1/2020 &ndash; 8/1/20). Procedures in the analysis were performed by general surgery and vascular surgery during this period. Power calculation was performed to ensure sample size was adequate for the purpose of mortality analysis. Using multivariate analysis, we created a best fit model to our data. Results are presented as odds ratio (OR) (95% CI). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

From our single center retrospective analysis of general surgery and vascular surgery patients, preoperative COVID-19 infection is associated with 9 times risk of mortality during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in New York City. Increased age and COVID 19 positive status significantly increased mortality rate. As COVID 19 infection rates continue to remain steady, we must strongly consider the COVID 19 status and risk associated with it when considering patients for surgery.

The COVID pandemic has had a widespread impact on surgical practice. Novel issues including hospital capacity, increased need for personal protective equipment, staffing redistribution, and reduction in elective operations to possibly protect patients led to marked decreased in elective procedure volumes and could increase urgent/emergent operations. The COVID impact on VHR is unknown. This study aims to compare the volume of elective and non-elective VHRs performed before COVID (BC) and during COVID (DC) within a large southeastern healthcare system.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Data was collected from an institutional database that contains information from a single southeastern healthcare system spanning 42 hospitals, including an 874-bed tertiary referral center for complex abdominal wall reconstruction. Patients were included if they were admitted with an ICD-10 PCS code for either open or laparoscopic VHR between January 2017 through June 2021. DC was defined as on or after March 2020.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

There were 3,558 VHRs in the 39 months PC and 1,228 in 16 months DC between 270 unique providers. When divided into quarters (Q) (3 month segments), the average number of cases per quarter was 281&plusmn;11 PC compared to 205&plusmn;58 DC. There was significant variability between the 6 PC quarters: 140-Q1, 274- Q2, 233-Q3, 165-Q4, 260-Q5, and 157 Q6. The ratio of non-elective to elective cases increased from 0.53 PC to 0.77 DC.

Both groups had a similar age (54.8&plusmn;18.8 years PC vs 55.8&plusmn;16.8 DC;p=0.09) and gender (57.3%vs56.7% female;p=0.79). There was no difference in race (71.5%vs70.4% White, 23.3%vs24.9% Black; p=0.22) or hispanic/latino ethnicity (4.8%vs5.7%; p=0.13). There was no difference in BMI (31.6&plusmn;8.6vs31.8&plusmn;9.6;p=0.43) or active tobacco use (5.3%vs5.4%;p=0.95). DC patients had lower rates of diabetes (30.33%vs26.9%;p=0.02), CHF (12.0%vs8.8%;p=0.002), and COPD (15.2%vs11.0%; p=0.0003). Rates of laparoscopic repair were similar (20.5%vs20.2%;p=0.84) but frequency of component separation during open VHR decreased (10.2%vs6.4%;p=&lt;0.0001). Rates of elective admissions significantly decreased (65.2%vs56.6%;p=&lt;0.0001). There was no difference in length of stay (7.5&plusmn;14.0vs7.6&plusmn;14.5;p=0.90) or ICU admission (16.5%vs15.7%;p=0.5). Rates of 30 day readmission increased (21.1%vs24.5%;p=0.012). There was no difference in total cost (PC to DC cost ratio 0.96;p=0.4).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Average total volume of VHR declined DC, and there was a proportional increase in the rate of non-elective admissions. DC patients appeared to be lower risk with smaller hernias (reduced comorbidities and component separations), but there were higher rates of 30-day readmission.

Introduction

Regional lymph node evaluation is essential for accurate staging of pancreatic cancer and may be associated with improved survival. This study will investigate whether academic institutions examine more lymph nodes for malignant pancreatic neoplasms than non-academic institutions.

Methods

Patients who underwent surgical resection for pancreatic cancer were identified using the National Cancer Database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effect of hospital type on nodal evaluation.

Results

Academic institutions were associated with a 1.2-fold (R.R.: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.17-1.22, p&lt;0.0001) increase in recommended lymph node harvest compared to non-academic institutions. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with a higher ideal lymph node harvest; however, the effect size is small.

Conclusion

Academic institutions are more likely to meet the NCCN guidelines for lymph node harvest in patients with pancreatic cancer.

Preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has recently been reported to be a more useful measure of renal dysfunction than preoperative serum creatinine levels. Several studies have examined the role of preoperative eGFR on surgical outcomes in cardiovascular operations but there is a paucity of data after hepatectomy. This study aims to assess the impact of preoperative eGFR on short-term surgical outcomes after hepatectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a 4-year (2014-2017) analysis of the (ACS-NSQIP) Participant Use Data Files. We included adult patients (age &ge;18) who underwent major and minor hepatectomy, which were stratified using CPT codes. Patients on dialysis preoperatively were excluded from the study. Patients were stratified into two groups based on their preoperative eGFR (eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> and eGFR &ge;60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Short-term outcomes measured were postoperative bile leak, liver failure, discharge disposition, hospital length of stay, 30-day minor and major complications, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
12,256 were included in the analysis (eGFR &lt;60 (n=1209) and eGFR &ge;60 (n=11047)). The mean age was 58.9&plusmn;13.5 years, 51.1% were females, 81.4% were white, and 32.5% of operations were major hepatectomies. Patients in the eGFR&lt;60 group were more likely to be older (67.6&plusmn;9.9years vs. 57.9&plusmn;13.5 years, p&lt;0.01), white (85.2% vs. 81.0%, p&lt;0.01), and be ASA3 class (79% vs. 67%, p&lt;0.01). On univariable analysis, patients in the eGFR &lt;60 group had prolonged length of stay (35.7% vs. 29.6%, p&lt;0.01), adverse discharge disposition (12.9% vs. 5.7%, p&lt;0.01), higher complication rates after minor (31.8% vs. 24.2%, p&lt;0.01) and major hepatectomy (14.4% vs. 11.4%, p&lt;0.01), and higher mortality rates (3% vs. 1.2%, p&lt;0.01). No differences between the two groups were found in terms of readmission rates, postoperative bile leak, and liver failure. Multivariable logistic regression controlling for age, gender, race (from MDRD formula), BMI, preoperative comorbidities, operative time, preoperative albumin levels, neoadjuvant therapy, and surgical type. Lower preoperative eGFR was associated with higher odds of prolonged length of stay, adverse discharge disposition, minor and major complications, and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Preoperative eGFR is a reliable predictor of postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing liver resections. Lower preoperative eGFR levels are associated with worse overall short-term outcomes. eGFR might be used in the future for preoperative risk stratification and perioperative planning.

Renal dysfunction is associated with post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). We sought to establish if a difference exists in this association when using GFR with or without the AA GFR corrector.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients undergoing hepatectomy from 2017-2019 targeted ACS-NSQIP hepatectomy modules were linked with ACS-NSQIP PUF. NSQIP defines PHLF using International Study Group for Liver Surgery definitions. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation for calculation of GFR was utilized. AA GFR correction multiplied GFR estimate for White patients by 1.21 using the MDRD Study equation. Preoperative GFR? 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (&ldquo;preop CKD&rdquo;) defined renal dysfunction. Multivariable regressions were used to estimate effects of perioperative factors on the primary outcome of PHLF.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 14,352 total patients, 595 (4.2%) experienced PHLF. Unadjusted rates of PHLF did not significantly differ between patients identifying as White (n=298, 3.6%), Black (n=38, 3.3%), Hispanic (n=29, 3.5%), and Asian (n=52, 4.5%; p=0.4). Major hepatectomy was performed in 4,478 patients with 414 cases of PHLF (9.3%) resulting in 73 deaths (1.6%). Sixty-five Black patients (5.7%) with preop CKD calculated with the AA corrector experienced PHLF. Omitting the AA corrector, 68 Black patients (5.6%) experienced PHLF. Both PHLF rates were higher than that of non-Black patients with preop CKD (n=343, 3.5%). When controlling for liver-specific covariates with multivariable logistic regression, preop CKD was associated with PHLF with or without use of AA GFR corrector (both p&lt;0.001, Table 1). Omitting the AA GFR corrector doubled the proportion of Black patients with preop CKD (n=95/8.3% vs. n=186/16.2%) which then exceeded the rate observed in White patients (n=895/11.2%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: While PHLF is a rare event, preoperative renal dysfunction remains strongly associated with this devastating outcome, with or without use of the AA corrector. The low number of AA patients precludes specific conclusions about whether the PHLF risk of AA patients who are reclassified by the corrector more closely approximates the overall preop CKD or non-CKD cohorts. Nevertheless, the AA corrector does not appear useful in this clinical context and it should be scrutinized for its validity in this and other clinical contexts. Among patients undergoing hepatectomy and other major operations, the AA GFR corrector may lead to Black patients with higher creatinine levels being overlooked during the preoperative medical screening process.

However, despite known benefit of NT, it remains unknown if socioeconomic disparities exist concerning administration of NT in patients presenting with borderline resectable disease. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data was obtained from the National Cancer Database from 2006-2017. A cohort was identified of 2,924 patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent successful surgical resection. Borderline resectable disease was defined as having venous or arterial involvement of the primary tumor. Demographic factors were analyzed and compared patients who received NT and those who underwent a surgery first approach. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression was performed to identify characteristics associated with the receipt of NT.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 2,924 patient included in this study, 49.3% received NT. Age was found to be associate with the likelihood of receiving NT with those &ge;70 being significantly less likely to receive NT compared to those &le;59 (OR 0.51, p&lt;.001). Geographic location was significantly associated with receipt of NT in the Northeast (OR 1.58), Southwest (OR 1.56), and West (OR 1.05) compared to those receiving treatment in the Central Western part of the United States (p&lt;.05). Lastly, patients treated at a community hospital were significantly less likely to receive NT compared to those treated at an academic institution (OR 0.49, p&lt;.001). Sex, race, insurance status, and education level were not associated with likelihood of receiving NT (p&gt;0.5). Those who received NT were more likely to be pathologically downstaged, have a higher rate of negative margin resection, and have a higher percentage of pathologic node negative disease compared to those who did not receive NT (p&lt;.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study reaffirms that use of NT in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is associated with improved oncologic outcomes. Identification of existing disparities in the use of NT in patients with borderline resectable disease allows directed efforts to decrease disparities and increase access to NT for all patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. Efforts should be made to investigate the safety and efficacy of NT use in older patient, encourage NT treatment at community centers or increase referrals to academic centers, and work to decrease geographic disparities in the treatment of borderline resectable disease

Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a rare but devastating disease with dismal survival. NCCN guidelines recommend radical cholecystectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy for stage T1b or greater disease. It is unknown to what degree these guidelines are followed and if SES impacts receipt of guideline-based care. We investigated the impact of social determinants of health in our regional hospital system. We hypothesized lower SES would be associated with decreased likelihood of receiving appropriate treatment and reduced overall survival.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining all patients diagnosed with GBC from 2009-2018 in a large regional hospital network comprised of 14 hospitals with regional catchment and cancer centers within an urban center. Primary exposure of interest was SES as assessed by the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). We additionally examined baseline characteristics, staging/grading, presentation details, treatment strategies, and overall survival. Multivariate analysis was used to analyze predictors of receipt of guideline-based care and Cox proportional hazards was used to study overall survival. Chart review was conducted for all patients who did not receive guideline-based treatment to explore underlying reasons.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Review identified 298 patients with GBC, with 81% of patients being low SES. 141 patients were candidates for resection and 71.6% of these patients received appropriate surgery. Advanced age was the only negative predictor of surgery receipt (OR 0.478 for every decade, p&lt;0.001). However, only 37.4% (n=49) of recommended patients received appropriate chemotherapy. Both advanced age (OR 0.491 for every decade, p&lt;0.001) and low SES (OR 0.17, p=0.005) were negative predictors of receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Individual chart review demonstrated that of these patients who did not receive appropriate care, approximately one-quarter refused surgery and one-third refused chemotherapy. Overall survival was predicted by receipt of appropriate surgery (p&lt;0.0001) and survival for stage 3 patients was predicted by receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (p&lt;0.002).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:

This analysis is the first to specifically evaluate social barriers to receiving guideline-based care for gallbladder carcinoma. While most patients received appropriate surgical care, two-thirds of patients did not receive appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy which correlates significantly with patient SES. These findings highlight targetable disparities for achieving equitable outcomes for all patients with this malignancy.

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a complicated surgery used to treat of a variety of diseases including periampullary tumors and pancreatitis. Historically, PD has been performed via a laparotomy, but laparoscopic PD techniques have been developed at high volume centers with experienced surgeons. Our study seeks to compare the experience of a laparoscopic PD program initiation of a single surgeon at two different institutions to determine if the operative time learning curve is shortened by surgeon experience. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective chart review of patients who have undergone laparoscopic PD at the initial institution (II) from 2012 to 2017 and the secondary institution (SI) from 2018 to 2021 was conducted. Patients &gt; 18 years of age who underwent laparoscopic PD for any indication at the both institutions were included. Bivariate analyses done by institution using Chi-square, Fishers exact test for categorical and Students t-test and Wilcoxon test for continuous variables. The learning curve was identified using one- sided CUSUM analysis of operative times. Patients were placed in groups of 5 for learning curve analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 110 participants were identified, 90 from the II and 20 from the SI. More patients at the II on final pathology were diagnosed with periampullary adenocarcinoma compared to the SI (65.6% vs. 40.0%, p=0.0132). Mean operative time at the II was significantly longer than the SI (346.2 minutes vs 310.8 minutes, p=0.0378). Operative times stabilized at the II after the 25<sup>th</sup> laparoscopic PD. At the SI, the operative times stabilized after the 5<sup>th</sup> operation (figure 1). Mean operative times after stabilization of the learning curve were similar between the two institutions. There was no significant difference in post-operative complications including pancreatic fistula, bile leak, or post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage between institutions. Median length of hospital stay was shorter at the SI (7.0 days vs. 10.5 days, p=0.0009).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The initial learning curve of a laparoscopic PD program at the second institution is shortened with a single surgeon experience when measuring average operative time with comparable outcomes. This study suggests that with strategic implementation, complex minimally invasive surgical programs can be safely transferred to another high-volume institution without significant loss of progress made during the initial experience.

Inefficient diagnostic modalities, vague symptomatology and resistance to chemotherapeutics make the management of PC a daunting challenge for any health system, particularly in low-and-middle income countries. Pakistan has a high burden of PC with 1162 new cases and 1129 deaths each year. To improve the care of PC we need country-specific data and research. We aim to review the research conducted on PC in Pakistan to identify gaps in knowledge and prioritize future research.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a review of literature using PubMed, ScienceDirect, GoogleScholar and PakMedinet. Keywords included &lsquo;pancreatic neoplasms&rsquo;, &lsquo;pancreatic cancer&rsquo;, &lsquo;Pakistan&rsquo; and their MeSH derivatives. Original research and reviews on PC in the Pakistani population published between 1995-2020 were included while articles on non-cancer pathologies were excluded. Variables of interest included &shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;geospatial location, study characteristics, level of evidence, quality of research, cancer types, and type of intervention studied. The quality of the articles was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 3,107 studies identified, 75 articles were included for review. The studies comprised of 17 (23%) retrospective cohorts, 7 (9%) prospective cohorts, 6 (8%) interventional studies (including 2 randomized control trials), 14 (19%) cross-sectional studies, 17 (23%) case reports, 2 (3%) case controls, 6 (8%) case series, 2 (3%) diagnostic studies, 2 (3%) ecological studies, 1 (1%) translational study and 1 (1%) systematic review. The trend of research has shown an overall increase over the past 10 years rising from 2-4 articles per annum in 2011-2013 to 9 manuscripts in 2018. Of articles that specified location and histopathology, the most studied neoplasm was adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head (74%) followed by periampullary carcinoma (41%). Of the research focusing on treatment strategies, most studies were on surgical intervention (n=38), followed by adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=9). Approximately 52% of studies had II-B level of evidence consisting mainly of observational studies.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is little information about pancreatic cancer in Pakistan, along all aspects of the disease process, ranging from translational to outcomes research. Most research is focused on surgical care and outcomes. Our report indicates a severe need for research capacity building pertaining to pancreatic cancer research.

The management of patients with early pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is evolving, however, surgery remains the only curative option. Historically, there have been significant disparities in access to appropriate care, especially for patients with resectable tumors. Our study aims to evaluate factors associated with survival in this patient population. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using the Texas Cancer Registry (TCR), 1861 PDAC patients were identified with early, resectable tumors (SEER stage 1) from 2004 - 2015. Besides characteristics provided by TCR, NIH designated centers (NIH-D) and high-volume centers (Leapfrog criteria, &gt;20 pancreatectomies/year) and Fragmentation of Care (FC, cancer care received &gt;=2 facilities) were identified. Multivariate models were used to identify factors associated with treatment characteristics and survival (OS).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of 18,079 patients with PDAC, 1861 patients presented with localized disease by SEER summary staging. Of this group, 20% received curative intent resections. 48% were not offered an operation, 2.6% refused, and 6.4% had contraindications to surgery. Resection rates over the course of the study for all patients with early PDAC were consistently below 40%, and dipped below 25% in 2010. 89% of patients did not receive chemotherapy. 

Curative resection (p&lt;.0001) and initial evaluation at an NIH designated center (NIH-D) (p &lt;.0001) were associated with improved OS. Fragmented care (FC) conferred an early survival benefit that diminished over the first 2 years (p=0.041), while initial evaluation at a high-volume center did not affect survival (p=0.729).

Black patients with early PDAC were less likely to be initially evaluated at an NIH-D (OR 0.567, p = 0.01), while patients with private insurance (OR 5.82, p &lt; 0.0001), and FC (OR 1.73, P&lt; 0.001) were more likely to initially be seen at NIH-D. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Consistent with previous studies, resection rates for early PDAC remain low and a poorly characterized disparity. Resection, as expected, strongly improved survival while initial evaluation at an NIH center and to an extent fragmented care were also associated with a survival benefit. Early access to specialized level care (NIH-D), appeared to be associated with improved survival.

For patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, short course (4 cycles) neoadjuvant systemic therapy with chemoradiation therapy is increasingly used for locally advanced, borderline resectable, and resectable disease. Pathologic complete response (pCR) is used as a means of assessing chemo-responsiveness and is a surrogate endpoint of survival. The pathological outcomes from prolonged (&gt;4 cycles) neoadjuvant systemic therapy are not known. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent surgical resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma between 2012 and 2020 after receiving prolonged neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy, at a single academic medical center. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 133 patients were included in the study. Most patients were men (56%), and median age was 64 (IQR 40-80). Sixty-seven patients (54%) had borderline resectable tumors, 35 (28%) had resectable tumors, and 23 (18%) had locally advanced disease. Eighty-five percent of patients received neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX and the remainder received gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant therapy. The median number of cycles received was nine (IQR 3-12). Only 12% of patients received neoadjuvant radiation therapy. Tumor regression grading of residual cancer after neoadjuvant therapy revealed a CAP score of 0, 1, 2, and 3, which was present in 3 (6%), 7 (14%), 21 (41%), and 20 (39%) patients, respectively. Evans grade IV, III, IIb, IIa, and I were present in 5 (5%), 20 (20%), 17 (19%), 23 (25%), and 28 (31%) patients, respectively. Five (4%) patients achieved a pCR. Sixty-one (46%) were lymph node-negative resections, and 100 (75%) were R0 resections.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

This is one of the largest studies to date of prolonged systemic neoadjuvant therapy in patients with resectable as well as borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. With pre-operative systemic therapy, patients tolerated prolonged cycles and favorable pathological outcomes were observed with neoadjuvant therapy only.

While the majority of cases of PHPT are attributable to single gland disease, approximately 15% represent four-gland hyperplasia. Reported 4-D CT scan localization specificity ranges from 50-96% which is in part attributable to false positive localization in multi-gland hyperplasia. We sought to quantify and characterize 4-D CT and operative findings in patients with PHPT found to have four-gland hyperplasia and compare them with findings in patients with single or double adenomas.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We queried an institutional database for patients with PHPT secondary to four-gland hyperplasia who underwent 4D CT imaging and parathyroidectomy. Patients with prior parathyroid surgery were excluded. Baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, operative indications, imaging findings, and operative findings were collected by chart review. Four-gland hyperplasia and adenomas were determined from operative and clinical pathology reports and cure of disease was confirmed with intraoperative or postoperative 50% drop in PTH. Proportions of false positive localization by 4D CT scan as well as conversion from a unilateral to bilateral exploration were determined.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 240 patients who underwent 4D CT imaging for parathyroid localization, 41 were found to have four-gland hyperplasia at the time of parathyroidectomy with a mean age of 63. Mean BMI was 29 and 75% were female. Patients with four-gland hyperplasia were less likely to have a preoperative calcium level greater than 1.0 above the upper limit of normal compared to patients with adenomas (63% versus 81%, p = .02), more likely to have osteoporosis (63% vs. 43%, p = .02), and more likely to report subjective symptoms (61% versus 43%, p = .04). Those patients with four-gland hyperplasia had falsely localized abnormal glands in 29 (70%), of which 17 (41%) localized to single lesions and 12 (29%) localized two lesions. The size of candidate lesions among patients with hyperplasia were smaller than among those with adenomas (mean diameter 10.3 vs 13.1 mm, p=.01). There was no difference in predicted quadrant of candidate lesion (p =.4). Eleven patients (26%) with four-gland hyperplasia had unilateral exploration which was converted to bilateral.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While utilization of multimodal imaging achieves preoperative localization in many patients with PHPT, a substantial proportion of patients with four-gland hyperplasia may be falsely localized. Surgeons should maintain an index of suspicion of four-gland hyperplasia, especially in cases of imaging uncertainty, modest enlargement of the image-localized gland, and unsatisfactory intraoperative drop in PTH.

Preoperative counselling relies on clinical staging information; however, final pathologic assessment can sometimes lead to upward stage migration. The goal of this study was to assess the frequency of upstaging at our institution and identify associations with patient and tumor factors.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We extracted data for primary thyroid cancers treated between 1/2/2013&shy;&shy;&ndash;12/31/2015 from our institutional cancer registry. Summary statistics for patient and tumor characteristics were performed. We identified cases of upstaging by comparing clinical and pathological tumor (T), nodal (N), and summary stage data. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify characteristics associated with upstaging. Age, sex, race, histology, and presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were included as covariates. Pearson&rsquo;s Chi-squared test was used to compare upstaging after total vs partial thyroidectomy.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: For the 5351 thyroid tumors resected from 5127 patients, mean patient age was 50.6 yrs (SD 15.4), 73.6% were female, and 77.7% were white. Tumor histologies were papillary (49.5%), papillary/follicular (43.8%), follicular (3.5%), medullary (1.6%), undifferentiated (0.7%), and other (0.9%). Total and partial thyroidectomy were performed in 81% and 15.7%, respectively. For tumors with complete stage information (Table 1), upstaging of T, N, and summary stage was present in 17.4% (572/3286), 17.8% (497/2800), and 10.7% (292/2720), respectively. Age was significantly associated with upstaging of N (OR 0.98, p&lt;0.001) and summary stage (OR 1.05, p&lt;0.001). Presence of LVI was significantly associated with upstaging of T (OR 2.83, p&lt;0.001), N (OR 3.02, p&lt;0.001), and summary stage (OR 3.99, p&lt;0.001). Sex, race, and histology had no significant association with the outcomes. Upstaging was significantly more common after total thyroidectomy vs partial thyroidectomy, for T stage (19.3% vs 6.3%, p&lt;0.001), N stage (19% vs 6.1%, p&lt;0.001), and summary stage (12.1% vs 0.6%, p&lt;0.001).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Upward stage migration occurs in a considerable proportion of thyroid tumors, most commonly after total thyroidectomy. Relatively low rates of upstaging after partial thyroidectomy are consistent with appropriate preoperative decision-making regarding extent of surgery. While patient age was noted to have a small association with N and summary stage upstaging, the presence of LVI had a strong significant association with all upstaging outcomes. These findings can inform preoperative counselling and expectation-setting for patients.

Reoperation for PHPT is successful in 95% of cases with two concordant imaging studies. The cost-benefit of preoperative localization in patients with PHPT undergoing initial parathyroidectomy has been previously investigated, though is largely unknown in reoperative surgery. The aim of this study is to determine which preoperative localization method is most cost-effective in reoperative PHPT.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Clinical decision analytic models comparing cost-effectiveness of localizing studies in reoperative PHPT were constructed using TreeAge Pro. Localization studies included US alone, US with fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay, sestamibi (Mibi) scan, four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and selective venous sampling (SVS). Literature review was performed to inform probabilities of successful localization using imaging sensitivity data, and cost input values were determined by current procedural terminology (CPT) codes collected using Medicare National reimbursement data from 2020. Effectiveness inputs were determined by localization of two concordant studies. Our initial base case model presumed a patient with reoperative PHPT with localization on initial ultrasound (US) and our second case presumed no localization on US. Cost and probability assumptions were varied via Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA) to test the robustness of the base case models.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Base case analysis of model 1 revealed that US with FNA and PTH assay was the most cost-effective study after localizing US in reoperative PHPT as compared to Mibi, 4D-CT, MRI, and SVS. Model 2 showed that 4D-CT was the most cost-effective study after negative US in reoperative PHPT compared to Mibi, MRI, and SVS. On PSA of model 1, after US localization, FNA with PTH assay remained the most cost-effective study. It was &gt; 99% to 100% less costly compared to all other methods, and less costly/more effective 41% of the time compared to 4D-CT, 84.5% compared to Mibi, 78.2% compared to MRI, and 73.8% compared to SVS. If not localized by US, on PSA, 4D-CT was the next most cost-effective test as it was less costly &gt; 99% to 100% compared to other studies, and less costly/more effective 91% of time compared to Mibi, 90.2% compared to MRI, and 78.7% compared to SVS.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These data suggest that US guided FNA with PTH assay is the most cost-effective confirmatory study after US for reoperative PHPT. 4D-CT is more cost-effective than either Mibi, MRI, or SVS in US-localized patients. In patients with negative US, 4D-CT is most cost-effective and thus preferred over Mibi, MRI, or SVS. Surgeons should consider this localization approach when feasible.

Early-stage disease is curable with surgery. We hypothesized that patients who live far away from healthcare institutions or have complicating socio-economic characteristics have worse outcomes.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was utilized to identify patients who were diagnosed with well-differentiated thyroid cancer between 2004 and 2018. Race, ethnicity, and distance from residence to healthcare clinic of diagnosis (great circle distance [GCD]) were analyzed with respect to severity of disease at presentation (stage) and outcomes. Advanced disease was defined by regional or distant metastasis. Kruskal-Wallis, Kendall&rsquo;s-tau, and Spearman correlation tests were used to assess initial possible associations. Subsequently, binary logistic regressions were conducted to calculate odds ratios (OR) for the associations that were discovered in the initial analysis regarding severity of disease at presentation. A cox regression was conducted to analyze survival differences between races and GCD, while controlling for age, income status, insurance status, and tumor staging.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 450,570 patients diagnosed with well-differentiated thyroid cancer during the study period. 76% of patients were female (24% of patients were male). 84.2% of the patients were Caucasian. 5.1% of the patients were Asian. 7% of patients were African American. 0.3% of patients were Native American. 68,462 patients lived within the closest quintile of GCD, which ranged from 0-4.2 miles from the healthcare center of diagnosis. African American populations had higher odds of advanced disease when compared to Caucasian populations (OR: 1.105 (CI: 1.032-1.183) p= 0.004). Patients with the furthest GCD (beyond the closest quintile) displayed higher odds of having advanced disease at diagnosis than patients in the group with the shortest GCD (OR: 1.028 (CI: 1.022-1.034) p = &lt;0.001). The overall median survival for patients in the dataset was 71.39 months after diagnosis. Adjusted Cox regression analysis of survival revealed that African American and Native American patients had detrimental survival outcomes when compared to Caucasians (HR 1.490 (p&lt;0.001) and 1.27 (p&lt;0.001), respectively).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Minority race and further distance from a health care provider are independently associated with higher stage disease and inferior survival outcomes. Therefore, access to care and socio-economic status affect thyroid cancer outcomes and should be the focus of targeted interventions to improve the care of these patients.

Dingell VA Medical Center, Surgery, Detroit, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Since the introduction of laparoscopic adrenalectomy in 1992, it became the standard of care for most of adrenal pathologies. This study aims to compare the outcomes and trends of open (OA) vs. laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) in veterans.
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
VASQIP was queried for adrenalectomies performed for benign pathologies during the period 2000-2019. Data collection included demographics, comorbidities, operative details, and postoperative outcomes. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed, and a p-value of &le;0.05 was considered significant.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 1,683 patients were included (91.4% males, mean age 59.6, mean BMI 31.2, and 87.2% with ASA class &ge;III). Overall, mean operative time (OT) was 3.2 hr, majority performed by general surgeons (71.4%), 5.7% required at least one-unit PRBC intraoperatively, and mean length of stay (LOS) 4.1 days. There were 12 (0.7%) 30-day mortalities, and 162 patients (8.8%) developed &ge;1 complication. LA was performed in 70.9% (1,306), with conversion rate of 0.85% (10). When compared with OA, patients with laparoscopic approach were likely independent (98.5% vs. 96.8%, p=0.028), shorter OT (3.1 hr vs. 3.4 hr, p&lt;0.001), less intraoperative blood transfusion (1.5% vs. 15.7%, p&lt;0.001), shorter LOS (3.3 day vs. 6.2 day, p&lt;0.001), and lower mortality (0.4% vs. 1.3%, p=0.025). LA was associated with lower morbidity rate (6.25 vs. 15.1%, p&lt;0.001), including lower superficial surgical site infection (0.9% vs. 2.9%, p&lt;0.001), reoperation (1.6% vs. 3.9%, p=0.003), and UTI (0.9% vs. 2.4%, p=0.011). Dependent functional status (OR 29, p&lt;0001), CHF (OR 3.5, p=0.046), ASA class &ge;III (OR 3.3, p=0.046), and smoking (OR 2.6, p=0.029) were independent predictors of mortality, while intraoperative transfusions (OR 5.9, p&lt;0.001), COPD (OR 2.8, p&lt;0.001), and dependent functional status (OR 2.8, p&lt;0.001) were predictors of morbidity. Laparoscopic approach has a protective effect with a reduction in morbidity rate (OR 0.56, p=0.004). Trend analysis showed eight-fold increase in use of LA [0.8% (2000) to 6.4% (2019)] (p&lt;0.001). Moreover, trend analysis for morbidity and mortality rates showed a significant reduction in the OA group (C statistics 0.48, p&lt;0.001; 0.47, p&lt;0.001, respectively), while for LA no significant change with overall lower rates.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is being well adopted in the VA system with an 8-fold increase over 20 years, with lower morbidity and mortality compared to the open approach for benign adrenal pathologies.

Wachtel<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania, Department Of Surgery, Philadelphia, PA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania, Department Of Radiology, Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Reoperative parathyroidectomy for recurrent or persistent primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has higher rates of failure and complication than initial parathyroidectomy. Parathyroid vein sampling (PAVS) is an important but rarely used technique for functional localization of abnormal parathyroid tissue. The goal of this study was to analyze our experience with PAVS for recurrent/persistent PHPT, to assess rates of localization and surgical outcomes for reoperative parathyroidectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with recurrent/persistent PHPT and non-localizing imaging who underwent PAVS at a single institution (2002-2018). A subset of patients has been previously reported. Concordance was assessed as agreement between PAVS and surgical findings based on both quadrant and side; sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated. Operative success was defined as &gt;50% decrease in intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Cure was defined as eucalcemia after surgery. The relationship between covariates and concordance was assessed with univariate logistic regression.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 25 patients included, the mean age was 55.4 yrs (Standard Deviation (SD): 12.8). The majority were female (64%) and Caucasian (60%). The majority had neurocognitive symptoms (80%) while a minority had nephrolithiasis (24%). DXA scan was performed on 10 patients, and 3 had osteoporosis. The mean preoperative serum calcium was 10.9 mg/dl (SD: 0.6) and mean urinary calcium was 332.8 mg/24 hr (SD: 223.3), and median preoperative PTH was 73.3 pg/ml (Interquartile Range (IQR): 46.0-130.0). PAVS localized to a single quadrant in 80%, a single side in 4%, two quadrants on opposite sides in 12%, and was non-localizing in 1 patient. At surgery, 4 patients had parathyroid adenomas in ectopic locations. The median percent drop in PTH was 83.3% (IQR: 45.2-91.1). 72% of subjects met criteria for intraoperative success. The final diagnosis was single adenoma in 14 patients, hyperplasia in 6, double adenoma in 1, parathyroid cancer in 1, and inconclusive in 3. The median abnormal gland size was 1.1 cm, and median weight was 138 mg. 18 subjects were normocalcemic post-operatively, 6 were hypercalcemic, and 1 was missing follow-up data. The median calcium level was 9.8 mg/dl &gt;6 mo after surgery. PAVS was 94% sensitive and had a 94% PPV for quadrant concordance; PAVS was 95% sensitive and had a 95% PPV for side concordance. On logistic regression, PAVS concordance was not associated with preoperative calcium, PTH, or parathyroid gland weight and size.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: PAVS demonstrates excellent positive predictive value for localization of abnormal parathyroid glands by both quadrant and side, and therefore should be considered for localization prior to reoperative parathyroid surgery. However, reoperative parathyroidectomy remains challenging and higher rates of recurrent and persistent disease are observed even in expert hands.

Most elective surgeries were postponed in an effort to avoid unnecessary hospital admissions and depletion of hospital resources. At a tertiary care center, elective surgeries were suspended beginning March 16, 2020, resuming May 26, 2020. Guidelines were written by the Section of Endocrine Surgery to identify patients whose surgical treatment could be safely deferred during this period. We sought to address the influence of COVID-19 on an academic endocrine surgery practice by examining patient characteristics, operations done, indications for surgery, and disease severity.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective chart review was conducted that compared patients operated on from January 1st, 2020, to August 31st, 2020, against patient operations from the prior year &ndash; January 1st, 2019, to August 31st, 2019. Patient demographics, indication for surgery, procedure, surgical pathology findings, and post-operative visits were obtained from the electronic medical record. Patients were grouped based on year of surgery. T-tests and chi-square analysis comparing the two groups were performed on each measured variable and/or outcome.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Groups were similar with respect to age, sex, race, ethnicity, and organ targeted for operation. In 2020, 204 patients were operated on during the study period compared to 292 in 2019. 2020 patients were significantly more likely to have private healthcare insurance (80.6% vs 50.5%) versus Medicare (17.4% vs 45.3%), p&lt;.0001. 2020 patients more often had reoperative surgery (p=0.0001) and a greater number of patients had thyroid surgery for an indeterminate nodule (20.7% vs 11.6%) or cancer (37.0% vs 26.8%) compared to benign disease (36.9% vs 54.9%), although the difference was not significant (p=0.057). 2020 patients had thyroid cancer on final pathology more often (50.6% vs 39.7%), although the difference was not significant (p=0.136). 2020 patients receiving surgery for thyroid cancer were found to have significantly higher rates of lymphatic invasion (p=.021), capsular invasion (p=.044), and gross extrathyroidal extension (p=.029) on final pathology.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There was a decreased volume of operations performed after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. Fewer 2020 patients had Medicare suggesting that older patients either electively delayed medical care or had operations canceled during this period. Patients undergoing thyroid surgery in 2020 were more likely to have an operation for cancer with more aggressive characteristics including lymphatic and capsular invasion and extrathyroidal extension. While the lasting effects of delayed surgical care are yet to be determined, this suggests patients with cancer were appropriately identified for surgical treatment.

During the early months of the pandemic, elective surgeries were halted in many regions. Endocrine operations, comprised primarily of thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal operations, are predominantly elective and may have been affected by these policies. We therefore aim to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the number of endocrine operations.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Vizient database was utilized to determine quarterly case volume from Quarter 1 2019 through Quarter 2 2021 by searching for ICD10 codes for thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal procedures. Pearson&rsquo;s chi squared test was performed to determine changes by age, sex, race, insurance status, and diagnosis before and during the pandemic.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Data from 515 hospitals were analyzed. Operative volume decreased at the beginning of 2020, consistent with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thyroid operations decreased by 35% from an average of 1,966/quarter during 2019 to a low of 1,286/quarter during 2020. Parathyroid operations decreased by 49% from an average of 596/quarter to a low of 303/quarter. Adrenal operations decreased by 18% from an average of 672/quarter to a low of 549/quarter. Endocrine operations subsequently increased from their nadir in the middle of 2020. Thyroid operations returned to 1602/quarter, 81% of their pre-pandemic average, parathyroid operations to an average of 481, 81% of pre-pandemic, and adrenal operations to an average of 622, 93% of pre-pandemic, with none of the case volumes reaching pre-COVID-19 levels by the middle of 2021 (Figure 1). The percentage of operations performed for thyroid cancer did not change during the pandemic (18% to 17%, p=0.159). Additionally, patients who underwent endocrine operations were similar with respect to age, sex, and race both before and during the pandemic. There was a decrease in patients undergoing thyroid surgery with private insurance (32.6% to 31.0%) and an increase in patients with Medicaid (19.3% to 20.9%, p=.047) after Quarter 1 2020. There were no changes in insurance status for those undergoing parathyroid or adrenal operations.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in the number of endocrine operations in academic and university-affiliated health systems that has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. The proportion of surgeries performed for cancer remained stable, as did patient demographics, and there was a shift in insurance coverage resulting in fewer privately insured patients and more Medicaid patients undergoing thyroid surgery. Further studies are needed to see how this decrease in operations will affect clinical outcomes of patients with endocrine surgical disease.

Wachtel<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania, Department Of Surgery, Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Higher surgeon volume has a well-established relationship with surgical outcomes. Several definitions of a high-volume adrenal surgeon have been proposed, ranging from 4-7 adrenalectomies annually. The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons requires a minimum of 10 adrenalectomies for accreditation. The goal of this study was to analyze the relationship between annual adrenalectomy volume and perioperative outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing adrenalectomy at a single institution (2013-2021). Data was abstracted from the electronic health record including demographics, operative cost, length of stay, operative duration, and readmissions. A high-volume surgeon was defined as performing &gt;10 adrenalectomies annually. Group comparisons were performed based on surgeon volume using the Chi Square test or Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, as appropriate. A p-value of &le;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of 767 adrenalectomies, the mean patient age was 57.6 yrs (Standard Deviation: 13.3). 32 surgeons performed adrenalectomies; 15 surgeons performed only a single adrenalectomy in the study period. The majority (84.5%, n=648) of adrenalectomies were performed laparoscopically. The median procedure cost was $1650.71 (Interquartile Range (IQR): $1050.39). The median procedure duration was 109 min (IQR: 66 min). The median patient length of stay was 2 days (IQR: 3). 11.3% (n=87) of patients were readmitted within 30 days of surgery at a median of 23 days after surgery (IQR: 43). Patient insurance type was categorized into public or private; 143 patients had public insurance (18.6%) and 621 patients had private insurance (81%). 654 procedures (85%) were performed by high volume surgeons (n = 3), with a mean of 27 adrenalectomies annually. Compared to low-volume surgeons, high-volume surgeons had significantly higher rates of laparoscopic adrenalectomy (88% vs 62%, p&lt;0.001), shorter median operative times (107 vs 134 min, p&lt;0.001), shorter median length of stay (2 vs 3 days, p&lt;0.001), and lower rates of readmission (15% vs 24%, p=0.026). Patients of high-volume surgeons were more likely to use private insurance (75% vs 66%, p=0.046). There was no statistically significant difference in operative costs by surgeon volume (high volume: $1639.12 vs low volume: $1831.04, p=0.12).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

High volume surgeons had higher rates of utilization of laparoscopic adrenalectomy and better perioperative outcomes including shorter operative times, shorter lengths of stay, and lower readmission rates compared to low volume surgeons. Surgeon volume should be considered to maximize patient outcomes and minimize costs related to operative time and length of stay.

However, no multicenter comparative studies have examined the effect of adrenalectomy on survival. We investigated the impact of adrenalectomy upon survival after the development of adrenal metastasis from renal cell carcinoma (RCC).


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients diagnosed with stage I-III RCC from 2008-2015 who underwent nephrectomy and developed metachronous adrenal metastases were identified from the SEER-Medicare linked database. Propensity scores were created for the probability of undergoing adrenalectomy using the following variables: age, stage at diagnosis, Elixhauser comorbidity index, and time interval between nephrectomy and development of adrenal metastasis. Patients were matched 1:1 using greedy nearest neighbor matching. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) after development of adrenal metastasis, evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 243 patients with RCC and metachronous adrenal metastasis, of whom 65 (26.7%) underwent adrenalectomy and 178 (73.3%) did not undergo adrenalectomy. Median age at development of adrenal metastases between the groups was similar (median 73 years in the adrenalectomy group vs. 76 years in the non-adrenalectomy group, p=0.842). Stage of RCC at diagnosis was comparable between groups (p=0.193). Categorized Elixhauser comorbidity index was lower in the adrenalectomy group compared to the non-adrenalectomy group (p=0.002). The median time from nephrectomy to development of adrenal metastasis was similar across groups (24 months in the adrenalectomy group vs. 28 months in the non-adrenalectomy group, p=0.145). Prior to matching, patients who underwent adrenalectomy demonstrated longer OS after the development of adrenal metastasis (median 48 months vs. 10 months, p&lt;0.001) and from initial RCC diagnosis (median 82 months vs. 57 months, p&lt;0.001). After matching, patients who underwent adrenalectomy continued to demonstrate longer OS after the development of adrenal metastasis (median 47 months vs. 16 months, p&lt;0.001) and from initial RCC diagnosis (median 73 months vs. 57 months, p=0.007).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Adrenalectomy was associated with substantially longer survival after development of RCC adrenal metastasis in the Medicare population. Larger scale investigations are needed to allow for more detailed adjustments for receipt of non-surgical treatments and presence of additional sites of metastasis. Ensuring access to adrenalectomy may enhance survival for appropriately selected patients with metastatic RCC.

Molecular tests including gene expression classifier (GEC) and thyroid sequencing (ThyroSeq) were developed to better stratify rate of malignancy (ROM) of AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules. This study examines and compares the utility of molecular tests in determining malignancy in surgical patients with concomitant CLT and AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data for 1648 patients with index thyroid nodules who underwent FNA and thyroidectomy at a single institution was performed. Patients with CLT and AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules were subdivided into 3 diagnostic groups: FNA only, FNA with GEC, and FNA with ThyroSeq. Patients with AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules without CLT were subdivided into the same 3 diagnostic groups, and served as a control. Final histopathology of the cohorts was further stratified into benignity and malignancy and analyzed using Chi-squared statistics.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the entire surgical series, there were 260 patients (16%) with CLT with an overall ROM of 56% on final pathology. There were 86 patients (33%) with CLT and AUS/FLUS nodules with a 52% ROM. In the CLT group, there was no significant difference in the ROM among patients with FNA only, suspicious GEC, or positive ThyroSeq results (48% vs 50% vs 69%, respectively p=0.42). Within the control group, there were 377 (23%) patients with AUS/FLUS nodules with a ROM of 59%. In those patients without CLT, the ROM was significantly higher when molecular testing was used (FNA only = 51%, suspicious GEC = 65%, positive ThyroSeq = 68%; p=0.02). There were also no statistically significant differences between patients with CLT and without CLT among the same 3 diagnostic groups.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Surgical patients with CLT and AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules have a high ROM. Molecular tests may have limited value in predicting malignancy in patients with CLT in AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules. Surgeons should carefully consider the utility of molecular tests to determine surgical resection in such patients with CLT.

With increased use of imaging, a large number of asymptomatic, incidental thyroid nodules are detected. To determine malignancy, a definitive diagnosis can only be made by invasive techniques including fine needle aspiration (FNA) or surgery, potentially resulting in unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules. To better assess at-risk lesions and reduce the morbidity of unnecessary procedures, the American College of Radiology developed the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS) to stratify malignancy risk based on ultrasound findings. However, the applicability of this scoring system to tumors other than the most common thyroid malignancy, papillary thyroid cancer, is not clear. This study aims to elucidate the efficacy of ACR TI-RADS and appropriate recommendation for biopsy in patients with follicular thyroid cancer (FTC).


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review of 143 patients who underwent surgery for FTC. Sixty-five patients met the inclusion criteria which included patients with a discrete thyroid nodule and adequate information on pre-operative ultrasound imaging reports to calculate a TI-RADS score. A corresponding TI-RADS score was calculated if not provided in the report. Data were analyzed to determine whether biopsy or follow-up would have been recommended based on ACR TI-RADS score alone. Pearson&rsquo;s chi-square was then performed to identify any association between TI-RADS scores and disease specific characteristics, and indications for surgery.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 65 included patients, the most common indications for surgery were a Bethesda III (30.8%) or IV (27.7%) FNA, followed by multinodular goiter (21.5%). Nearly half of patients (n=30,46%) with FTC had a calculated TI-RADS score of I-II. The remainder were primarily TI-RADS III and IV (III 20.0%, IV 26.2%, V 7.7%). Nodules recommended for biopsy were slightly larger however the difference was not significant (41.2 vs 34.1mm, p=0.171). Utilizing the TI-RADS score algorithm and accounting for nodule size, 30 (46.2%) of the 65 patients would have undergone biopsy. Of those 35 not recommended for biopsy, only 4 (11.4%) would have been recommended to have ultrasound follow up. When further stratified into those recommended for biopsy and those not recommended for biopsy, there was no difference in pathologic characteristics, such as nodule size, presence of vascular or capsular invasion, and preoperative FNA Bethesda classification.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Utilization of the ACR TI-RADS classification system failed to recommend biopsy of more than half of all FTCs, suggesting a shortcoming in broad applicability to thyroid malignancies. As such, the clinician should take particular care with the use of TI-RADS when FTC is suspected. Additional investigations are needed to improve image-based risk stratification of follicular thyroid cancers.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We reviewed a retrospective database of 2325 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for PHPT by three high volume endocrine surgeons from 2001 to 2021. We defined very elevated PTH (vePTH) as PTH level &ge;300 pg/ml. We divided the patients into 2 groups: vePTH and non-vePTH (preoperative PTH &lt; 300 pg/ml). ANOVA and Chi-Squared analysis were used to compare patient demographics, disease characteristics, and surgical outcomes between the two groups. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A small minority of patients (n=102, 4%) presented with vePTH and were more likely to be male, younger, African American, and had higher pre-operative calcium levels (Table 1). As predicted, vePTH patients were more likely to have cancer when compared to non-vePTH patients. Importantly, benign multi-gland disease was seen in 25% of patients with vePTH. With regard to outcomes, vePTH patients had lower cure rates and significantly higher recurrence rates. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Very elevated PTH levels in patients with PHPT are associated with a greater chance of parathyroid malignancy and lower cure rates. There is still a relatively high incidence of parathyroid hyperplasia or double adenoma in these patients.

Chen<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Endocrine Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Health literacy is the ability to comprehend and apply health information to make informed healthcare decisions. Poor health literacy has been found to have several adverse effects on health including inability to provide informed consent, medication noncompliance, inconsistent follow up, and delayed seeking of care. Data about health literacy in endocrine surgery is currently lacking. In this study, we aim to evaluate the overall health literacy of patients with thyroid disease and potential risk factors of limited health literacy.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We evaluated a total of 86 patients with thyroid disease in endocrine surgery clinic. Health literacy was evaluated by Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS), a validated health literacy screening tool comprised of a 4-question self-rated assessment on a 5-point Likert scale. Limited, marginal and adequate health literacy are defined as score of 4-12, 13-16 and 17-20 respectively. Patient demographics including age, gender, race, disease etiology, employment status and median annual household income by zip code were obtained. ANOVA, paired t-tests, and Chi-square test were used to compare health literacy between within each demographic. Nominal Logistic Regression was used to identify factors independently related to health literacy. IBM SPSS 27.0 was used for statistics analysis. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistical significance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 86 patients, 66 (76.7%) had adequate health literacy, 13 (15.1%) had marginal literacy, and 7 (8.1%) had limited health literacy. There were significantly more patients with adequate health literacy in employed patients than unemployed cohort (88.6%% vs. 65.9%%, p=0.02). Women tended to be more likely than men to have adequate health literacy (77.8% vs 71.4%, p=.111). Likewise, there was minimal variation among income, age, race, and clinical diagnoses. Multinomial linear regression showed that employment status was independently related to health literacy (OR 5.24, CI1.43-19.18, p=0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Most patients with thyroid diseases from the endocrine surgery clinic at our institution have adequate health literacy. Employment status is an independent risk factor of health literacy.

Lafon<sup>1</sup>, J. M. Donahue<sup>1</sup>, B. Wei<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Cardiothoracic/Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: To determine whether prophylaxis with oral diltiazem is associated with a lower rate of atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing robotic lobectomy. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of all robotic lobectomies performed at our institution between January 1<sup>st</sup> of 2012 and December 19<sup>th</sup> of 2019 was conducted. Patients with a prior medical history of atrial fibrillation or current beta-blocker use were excluded. Patients were divided into two cohorts: before and after we began the use of prophylactic oral diltiazem, which was added to the postoperative care protocol in August of 2014. Group 1 included patients who underwent surgery before the protocol change; group 2 included patients who underwent robotic lobectomy after the protocol change AND received oral diltiazem after surgery. A dose of 30 or 60mg was given post-operatively after arrival to the floor from the recovery area, and continued every 6 hours until discharge. Statistical analysis was performed using student T-test for nominal variables and Chi-Square test for categorical variables.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 622 patients underwent robotic lobectomy during the study period. After excluding patients with a history of atrial fibrillation (n=48), current beta-blocker use (n=144), and patients who did not actually receive postoperative diltiazem (n=101), 329 patients remained, with 133 patients in Group 1 and 196 patients in group 2. No significant differences were evidenced when comparing patient demographics. Mean age for group 1 was 64 years &plusmn;11.9 vs 63 &plusmn;11.5 in group 2 (p=0.2). Sixty-six percent were males in group 1 vs 79% in group 2 (p=0.09). Smoking status (current/former/never) was similar between both groups (p=0.9). There was no difference with regards to the side and location of operation with 69% right lobectomies in group 1 vs 66% in group 2 (p=0.4). The length of stay was also similar (4.2&plusmn;6.1 days in group 1 vs 3.5&plusmn;3.9 days in group 2, p=0.1). There was no significant difference in the rate of postoperative atrial fibrillation between group 1 and group 2 (7% (9/133) vs. 8% (16/196) p=0.6) (Table). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Atrial fibrillation prophylaxis with diltiazem in patients undergoing general thoracic surgery has been described in the literature, however, this has not been studied after robotic operations. In this study, prophylaxis with oral diltiazem for patients undergoing robotic lobectomy was not associated with a lower rate of post-operative atrial fibrillation when compared with patients not receiving diltiazem prophylaxis. These results suggest that oral diltiazem for the prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation after robotic lobectomy may not be beneficial.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of liposomal bupivacaine intercostal nerve block (LB-INB) on postoperative opioid usage, pain, and complication rates following bilateral lung transplantation.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review was performed of all patients undergoing bilateral lung transplantation at our institution between January 2017 and May 2020. Surgeon preference of LB-INB usage varied, creating 2 groups. Patients received either LB-INB in addition to systemic pain control measures or systemic pain control only (SPCO) following clamshell thoracotomy. Patient characteristics as well as postoperative pain scores, opioid usage, and complication rates were assessed. A composite endpoint of postoperative ileus or pneumonia was created to assess complications commonly associated with opioids. Statistical differences were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test or chi-squared test.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 63 patients (38 LB-INB, 25 SPCO) were included. The average age was 57.4&plusmn;11.5 years. The composite of postoperative ileus or pneumonia occurred in 10 patients (26%) in the LB-INB group compared with 13 patients (52%) in the SPCO group (odds ratio [OR] 3.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 8.81; p=0.038). Opioid administration and pain scores during the first 4 postoperative days were similar between groups. Median morphine equivalent administration during the first four postoperative days was 291 mg (IQR, 204-724 mg) and 377 mg (IQR, 231-919 mg) in the LB-INB groups and SPCO groups, respectively (p=0.481). Average peak pain scores during the first four postoperative days were 7.3 &plusmn;1.7 and 7&plusmn;1.9 in in the LB-INB groups and SPCO groups, respectively (p=0.588) There were no significant differences in median ICU length of stay (5 days; IQR, 4-9 days) or time to extubation (56 hours; IQR, 33.8-91.1 hours) between treatment groups. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The addition of LB-INB did not lower opioid usage or pain scores during the first 4 postoperative days following bilateral lung transplantation. However, the rate of the composite of postoperative ileus or pneumonia was significantly lower in the LB-INB group compared to SPCO. Clinically improved outcomes have been achieved but further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism as well as to determine means of further improvement.

Access to cancer care, especially surgery, may be limited in rural areas. However, the interaction between rurality and specific reasons for non-receipt of surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not known. We investigated the geographic differences in the decision to undergo surgical treatment for patients with potentially resectable NSCLC.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to identify patients with clinical stage I, II, and IIIA (N0-N1) NSCLC between 2004-2017. Patients from rural and small-town counties were compared to urban and metropolitan counties and the reason for non-receipt of surgical treatment was evaluated. The likelihood of (1) undergoing surgery, (2) being recommended primary non-surgical management without surgical contraindication, (3) surgery being deemed contraindicated due to high risk, or (4) failure to undergo recommended surgical management were determined while controlling for sociodemographic, clinical, hospital, and travel characteristics.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The study included 398,540 patients with potentially resectable NSCLC with 12.9% (n=51,432) from rural/small-town areas. Overall, 59.9% (n=207,915) of urban/metro and 57.0% (n=29,303) of rural/small-town patients underwent surgery (p&lt;0.001). (1) The likelihood of patients with resectable NSCLC receiving surgical treatment (n=237,218) was lower for those from rural/small-town counties (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.79-0.82). (2) Being recommended non-surgical management without surgical contraindication (n=121,711) was more likely in rural/small-town patients (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.13-1.19). (3) The likelihood of surgery being deemed contraindicated due to patient risk (n=29,911) was higher in rural/small-town patients (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.29), and findings persisted in patients with few or no major medical comorbidities. (4) Surgery being recommended but not performed (n=9,106) was also more likely in rural/small-town patients (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.15-1.33).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

There are geographic disparities in the management of NSCLC. Patients from rural and small-town counties are less likely to undergo surgical treatment for potentially resectable disease for several reasons: they are more likely to be recommended non-operative management or to be deemed too high risk for surgery, and they are less likely to undergo surgery even when recommended.

This study aims to quantify the effect of BMI on early clinical outcomes following CABG.

<br><br><strong>Method</strong>: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database was queried for adult patients who underwent first-time Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) patients in our center from 2014 to 2020. BMI and gender were investigated as primary risk factors for intraoperative outcomes, in-hospital postop outcomes, and hospital readmission using multiple logistic regression models. Propensity score weighting was used due to imbalances in the observational groups. Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (Loess) plots of BMI were inspected for each outcome with a predicted probability plot of the interaction between BMI and gender.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 591 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 79% were male (n=468) and 21% were female (n=124). Underweight (U), healthy (H) and obese (O) BMI was defined as &lt;25, 25-35, and &gt;35 respectively. There was significantly higher proportions of males in the overweight BMI category (F vs M: O:35 vs 65%, p &lt; 0.001). Patient demographics and comorbidities were all well-balanced with no significant differences after propensity weighting. There was no significant difference in intraoperative outcomes including OR time, cross clamp time, by-pass time and intraoperative blood loss require blood transfusion (p &gt;0.05). Approximately half (49.16%) of patients had one or more in-hospital postop events, and 62 (10.56%) had hospital readmission following discharge. After propensity weighting, the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) was significantly higher in the obese group (U: 1.5%, H: 0.6%, O: 4.5%, p = 0.016) while pneumothorax requiring drainage appeared to be significantly higher for those in the obese group (U: 0.3%, H: 1%, O: 2%, p = 0.028). Death at discharge was found to be significantly higher in the underweight group (U: 2.5%, H: 0.3%, O: 0.3%, p = 0.028, p= 0.008). Loess plots for in-hospital postop events and hospital readmission by BMI and gender showed a slight downward trend in postop events as BMI increased. Underweight and obese patient appeared to have slightly higher values of hospital readmission for both genders.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There was no difference in perioperative outcomes among the cohort. Obese patients who underwent CABG have a higher risk of SSI. Mortality was higher in the underweight patient group. In general, BMI disparities did not affect the risk of perioperative death and other adverse outcomes.

Temporary Epicardial Pacing Wires (TEPWs) are routinely placed in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery (CABG) to treat unforeseen post-operative arrhythmias. The practice is however controversial due to catastrophic complications associated with its use. This study aims to determine the frequency of TEPWs use postoperatively, associated complications and predictors of their use in order to limit the routine and non-selective placement of TEPWs in CABG.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This single sample longitudinal study involved 322 consecutive patients who underwent isolated CABG in the department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, from September 2019 to August 2020. Demographic, peri operative and outcome variables i.e. post-operative TEPWs use were extracted from patients files and electronic database. Independent t-test and chi-squared test were applied for descriptive analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were also built to explore predictors of TEPWs use in the sampled population

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 322 isolated CABG patients were analysed, where only 27 (8.4%) patients required TEPWs. Mean age of the patients requiring and not requiring TEPWs was 66.3 &plusmn; 8.9 vs 58.7 &plusmn; 8.9, p&lt;0.001 and ejection fraction (%) was 44.1 &plusmn; 12.8 vs 48.9 &plusmn; 12.8 p=0.032 respectively. After adjusting for clinically plausible demographics and perioperative variables, increasing age and low Ejection fraction % were found to be significantly associated with the use of TEPW in post-operative period of isolated CABG patients. No complication of TEPWs were recorded in our study. Three patients out of 27 required permanent pacemaker due to complete heart block. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
As use of TEPWs in the post-operative period is low hence routine placement of temporary epicardial pacing wires in isolated CABG should be discouraged and only preferred in patients who will need them, such as patients with increased age or a low left ventricular Ejection fraction. TEPWs use is likely to increase by 9% and 5% with each increase in age year and each decrease of EF respectively. Hence, TEPWs&rsquo; use should be case-specific in isolated CABG patients. Such approach will not only decrease the cost of surgery but also prevent life threatening complications associated with TEPWs.

Xie<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Aortic valve disease (AVD) is the most frequent valvular heart disease and a rising health concern in the United States due to its aging population contributing to increased prevalence. Depression has been reported to be associated with poorer adherence to medical treatment, delayed/declined surgical intervention, and worse quality of life in people with cardiovascular disease. Although there is significant effort improving medical care and surgical interventions to treat AVD, little attention has been given to the psychological impact of AVD and the assessment of mental health care among people living with AVD. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression and evaluate geographic disparities in outpatient screening of depression in the United States.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We analyzed data from the CDC&rsquo;s National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2006-2018) to estimate the prevalence of depression and evaluate disparities in depression screening among outpatients with aortic valve disease. Patient (demographics, comorbidities, lab values, and screening/treatment received) and clinician characteristics were analyzed. Multivariable logistic analyses identified significant factors associated with the outpatient depression screening. The patient visit weight was applied to obtain nationally representative estimates from all analyses.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 343,030 patients, 1,040 (0.3%) had AVD; and of them, 6% were depressed, and only 2% AVD patients were screened for depression. The outpatient depression screening in AVD patients varied by geographic region significantly. For instance, 32% of AVD patients were from the South and 32% from the Northeast; yet among the AVD patients screened for depression, only 6% were from the South and 44% from the Northeast (p=0.058). AVD was not a predictor of outpatient depression screening based on the multivariable analyses; predictors included geographic region, provider specialty (primary care provider vs. other specialties), reason for visit (preventive care vs. pre-/post-surgical evaluation), history of cerebrovascular disease, and obesity. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The geographic disparities in outpatient depression screening rate indicate an area of medical inequity that requires future investigation and intervention. Future studies are required to identify and implement optimal depression screening and management strategies for people afflicted with AVD.

Lui<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Stanford University, Department Of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Palo Alto, CA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Stanford University, Stanford Health Care, Palo Alto, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Language discordance is a well-documented barrier to accessing quality care. There are 62 million people who speak a language other than English and call the U.S. their home, 26 million of whom are limited-English proficient (LEP). Hospitals often rely on ad hoc and professional interpreters but studying the effect of interpreting on patient satisfaction has been largely absent in the surgical inpatient population. We sought to determine through personal interviews if a difference existed in satisfaction and understanding between LEP and English-speaking cardiothoracic surgical inpatients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a single-institution cross-sectional interview investigation. Given the lack of prevalent surgery-specific patient satisfaction questionnaires, a new 5-point Likert scale questionnaire (1 is strongly disagree, 5 is strongly agree) was created for this study. Scores from the &ldquo;general satisfaction&rdquo; and &ldquo;quality of information transmission&rdquo; sections were compared between the two groups, LEP and non-LEP, using unpaired t tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In total, 31 English-speaking and 19 LEP (15 of whom required an interpreter because of insufficient English proficiency) cardiothoracic surgical inpatients consented and completed the interview. The English-speaking and LEP group did not differ significantly concerning the following: satisfaction levels with a) overall care, b) their surgeon, c) amount of time nurses spent with them and understanding of a) plan for their medical care, b) instructions from healthcare team, c) surgical procedure, d) reason for their surgery, e) risks of surgery, f) expected recovery process. The two patient groups also did not differ regarding the importance of communicating with their health care team in their primary language (language-concordant health care). The LEP group gave a higher score for satisfaction with the amount of time their doctors spent with them than English-speaking patients (LEP 4.89, English 4.26, p=0.006). Within the LEP group, 67% of patients preferred a health care team who speaks their language fluently over professional interpreters and family member interpreters, 40% of patients reported requesting an interpreter since one was not automatically provided, and 93% of patients reported using a family member interpreter.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This investigation is the first to study interpreter services in surgical inpatients. Contrary to previous literature, both English-speaking and LEP patients report comparable value given to language-concordant health care. We report high and comparable patient satisfaction and surgical understanding scores between English-speaking and LEP patients. While not assessed in this study, differences in patient expectation concerning their health care may obscure the true difference. When asked how their care could be improved, LEP patients suggested automatically calling interpreters and increasing the non-English speaking medical team.

However, clinical deterioration, defined as end organ dysfunction following surgery, usually occurs after a potentially preventable inciting event. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of, and the factors associated with, postoperative deterioration following esophagectomy.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients who underwent esophagectomy were identified from the ACS NSQIP Procedure-Targeted database (2016-2019). The primary outcome was postoperative deterioration (PD) defined as cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, respiratory failure requiring reintubation, renal failure, or septic shock. Factors associated with PD and with 30-day mortality were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 4,507 patients (79.8% male; mean age 64, SD 10.4 years) who underwent esophagectomy, 614 (13.6%) developed PD. Most esophagectomies were for malignancy (79.8%), performed minimally invasively via laparoscopy and thoracoscopy (49.9%), and rarely required conversion to open esophagectomy (5.9%). Median length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7-12) and median time to PD was 3 days (IRQ 2-8). Among patients with PD, 46.1% had a previously documented postoperative complication, the most common being pneumonia (28.8%), organ space infection (16.9%), and sepsis (4.4%). Overall, 30-day mortality was 2.7%; of those, 89.3% were associated with PD. On multivariate logistic regression, preoperative factors associated with an increased odds of PD included preoperative transfusion (OR 6.20; 95%CI 1.92-20.03), age 70-79 (OR 1.99; 95%CI 1.26-3.14, vs. &lt;50 years), and BMI&lt;18.5 (OR 1.97; 95%CI 1.26-3.09, vs. BMI 18.5-24.9). Open esophagectomy compared to completely minimally invasive esophagectomy was associated with increased odds of PD (OR 1.69;95%CI 1.35-2.13). Postoperative factors associated with increased odds of PD included esophageal leak (OR 4.06; 95%CI 3.05-5.39), pneumonia (OR 3.70; 95%CI 2.89-4.74), and myocardial infarction (OR 3.00; 95%CI 1.22-7.39) (Figure 1). On multivariate logistic regression, PD was independently associated with increased odds of 30-day mortality (OR 59.5;95%CI 32.83-107.94).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Postoperative deterioration is common following esophagectomy and is associated with mortality. The most common associated complications were infectious. Index postoperative complications, namely pneumonia and organ space SSI, must be identified early and appropriately managed. Alert and response systems should be developed to identify patients at risk for PD.

Lower rates of thoracic surgery have been identified for older patients due to concerns regarding increased risks of postoperative outcomes. The study aims to evaluate short-term outcomes (&lt;30 days) of patients who underwent lobectomy over 80 years of age compared with those between 61 and 79 years old, and &le;60 years of age, and to identify other independent risk factors associated with mortality.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Patients who underwent open (CPT code 32480) or thoracoscopic lobectomy (CPT code 32663) were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS &ndash; NSQIP) database between 2013 and 2019. Only elective, non-emergent procedures were selected for the analysis. Patients were categorized by age: &le;60, 61 &ndash; 79, and &ge; 80 years. Overall in-hospital complications, respiratory complications (pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, unplanned intubation, failure to wean), multiple complications (defined by: &ge; 2 complications), and mortality were analyzed among the three age groups.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

A total of 23,702 cases met the inclusion criteria, of whom 66.8% were aged 61 &ndash; 79, and 7.9% were aged 80 and older. Mean age was 67 &plusmn; 10 years, 56.0% were female, 74.6% were white, and 65.5% underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy. Postoperative complications were observed in 13.0% of patients, and the mortality rate was 1.2%.

Increasing age was associated with a significantly higher frailty index score (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, p&lt;0.001) and higher rates of thoracoscopic lobectomy (62.7%, 65.9%, 70.3%, p&lt;0.001). Patients &ge; 80 years old had significantly greater rates of overall complications (15.0% vs. 13.6% for 61 &ndash; 79 and 10.8% for &le;60, p&lt;0.001), respiratory complications (7.8% vs. 6.8% and 4.9%, p&lt;0.001), multiple complications (5.5% vs. 4.4% and 2.8%, p&lt;0.001) and mortality (2.8% vs. 1.4% and 0.5%, p&lt;0.001).

Based on multivariable analysis, compared to patients &le;60 years old, patients &ge; 80 years old were associated with significantly higher risks of overall complications (1.70, 95% CI 1.38 &ndash; 2.10), multiple complications (2.73, 95% CI 1.93 &ndash; 3.87), respiratory complications (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.68 &ndash; 2.92), and mortality (OR 6.07, 95% CI 3.44 &ndash; 10.72). In addition to older age, other preoperative risk factors including open lobectomy, frailty, dyspnea, chronic steroid use, history of bleeding disorders, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class, and longer operative time were significantly associated with greater risks of mortality.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The current study demonstrated higher postoperative mortality and complication rates among older patients who underwent lobectomy despite controlling for preoperative comorbidities and frailty. Further studies are needed to improve the safety of older adults after lobectomy.

Reinersman<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Oklahoma College Of Medicine, Surgery, Oklahoma City, OK, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Oklahoma College Of Medicine, Division Of Cardiac, Thoracic, Vascular Surgery, Department Of Surgery, Oklahoma City, OK, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Lung nodules are increasing found on routine imaging, particularly in patients who are high risk for lung cancer or metastases from other malignancies. Many nodules are concerning for malignancy yet are small and difficult to biopsy with standard methodologies. Surgical biopsy is often an ideal option particularly with minimally invasive approaches however small nodules (less than 2 cm) may be difficult to locate via thoracoscopy or robotic procedures. We present a unique single procedure methodology utilizing transthoracic localization and dye marking of lung nodules for minimally invasive surgical resection.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A single institution retrospective analysis was performed for all patients undergoing navigational bronchoscopy with percutaneous transthoracic localization and dye marking followed by resection of lung nodules. Patients underwent computed tomography (CT) chest imaging on the day of operation, followed by navigational bronchoscopy and percutaneous access planning utilizing specialized software. Navigational bronchoscopy was performed to calibrate the system, and then percutaneous transthoracic access was done under navigational guidance (image 1). Nodules were injected with a combination of indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue dye and then resected via minimally invasive approach (image 1).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Twenty patients underwent the combined 22 procedure at our institution, with a total of 27 nodules localized and resected. Ten patients underwent robot-assisted procedures and the remaining 12 underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS). The majority of patients had suspected malignant nodules, either primary lung cancer or metastatic nodules. Eleven procedures were done targeting more than one nodule. All procedures resulted in successful localization and resection of targeted nodules. Nodules ranged from 5-37 mm with a mean size of 12.7 mm (n=27). The depth of the nodules ranged from 3 - 27 mm from visceral pleura with a mean depth of 11.7 mm (n=27). Three nodules were non-solid solid. Average operating room time was 147 minutes with average localization procedure of 15.3 minutes. The median postoperative length of stay was 2 days. Complications occurred in 3 patients including air leak (n=2) and pleural effusion (n=1). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

We describe a unique efficient single procedure approach to localize and resect small peripheral lung nodules with minimal complications. This allows for improved local management of nodules earlier due to the inadequacies of other conventional technologies. Our technique provides high accuracy and is markedly efficient without the complications of a secondary procedure, even if performed the same day (i.e. CT-guided marking or hook wire placement).

Increased lung cancer mortality has been reported with residential rurality and tends to be seen in socioeconomically disadvantaged patients. We studied whether the rurality of patients&rsquo; residences and their SES affects perioperative outcomes after robotic-assisted video-thoracoscopic (RAVT) pulmonary lobectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively analyzed 709 consecutive patients who underwent RAVT pulmonary lobectomy by one surgeon over 10.8 years. Using rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes and distance to nearest major urban cities, a two-step filter was implemented to classify patients&rsquo; residential ZIP codes as rural or urban. The &ldquo;Rural&rdquo; and &ldquo;Urban&rdquo; patients were further classified based on socioeconomic deprivation as measured by the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) values, which were matched with patient ZIP codes, and the patients were classified as &ldquo;Advantaged&rdquo; or &ldquo;Disadvantaged&rdquo;. Perioperative outcomes, intraoperative (intraop) complications, and postoperative (postop) complications were compared using Chi-Square (&chi;2) tests, Student&rsquo;s t-tests, Fisher&rsquo;s exact tests, or Kruskal-Wallis tests, with p&le;0.05 as significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Patients were classified as Advantaged Urban (AU; n=119), Advantaged Rural (AR; n=142), Disadvantaged Urban (DU; n=152), or Disadvantaged Rural (DR; n=265), with 31 patients unable to be categorized and excluded. Most intraop and postop complication rates were similar between groups. Both AR and DR patients tended to have longer median chest tube duration (p=0.0084). Incidence of tracheobronchial injury was significantly higher in AU and AR patients (p=0.0031) (See Table 1). There was no significant difference in median survival time between groups. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that age, patient classification based upon rurality and ADI, smoking status, diabetes, and intraop tracheobronchial injury were significant independent predictors of chest tube duration (See Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients had similar rates of intraop and postop complications with respect to rurality and ADI classification, except for the described differences in tracheobronchial injury and chest tube duration. Given this, RAVT pulmonary lobectomy is feasible and safe in patients from both rural and urban ZIP codes across low and high ADI classifications. Future research might focus upon creating a SES index involving other factors, including race, ethnicity, marital status, and patient insurance information.

Nadeem<sup>1</sup>, G. Kennedy<sup>1</sup>, S. Singhal<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania, Thoracic Surgery, Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI) can help improve pulmonary tumor resection outcomes by allowing real-time visualization of small or synchronous lesions that are difficult to detect using conventional techniques. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the level of folate receptor alpha (FRa) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expression in preoperative biopsy specimens can be used to select candidates for and predict the success of IMI-guided resection with tracers targeted for those biomarkers


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Twelve patients with lung cancer were administered a FRa-targeted fluorescent tracer (OTL38) and four patients with suspected colorectal pulmonary metastases were administered a CEA-targeted fluorescent tracer (CD66e) prior to surgery. During the operation, pulmonary tumors were visualized and resected using a wavelength-specific thoracoscope. ImageJ was used to calculate tumor mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) and tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs). After obtaining histological slides of preoperative biopsy specimens, FRa or CEA staining was scored by a board-certified pathologist. Staining scores were compared to fluorescence quantification data


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Mean MFI of analyzed specimens were 103.6 units (AU) (IQR: 100.8-131.8 AU), and mean TBR was 3.4 (IQR: 2.7-4.5). Of the preoperative biopsy specimens stained for FR?, 41.7% (5/12) had a score of 2+, 41.7% (5/12) had a score of 3+, and 16.7% (2/12) had no staining. During IMI guided resections of these 12 nodules, 83.3% (10/12) fluoresced whereas 16.7% (2/12) did not. Level of FRa expression correlated with IMI efficacy (R<sup>2</sup>=0.81)(p&lt;0.05). All specimens with a score greater than 1+ fluoresced compared to those with no staining present (p&lt;0.05) (Figure 1A). FRa staining scores also correlated with MFIs (R<sup>2</sup>=0.92, Figure 1B) and TBRs (R<sup>2</sup>=0.77, Figure 1C)(p&lt;0.05). For the CEA-stained specimens, 50% (2/4) were scored 2+ and 50% (2/4) were scored 3+. Degree of CEA staining correlated with fluorescence intensity in a log-linear fashion(p&lt;0.05)(R<sup>2</sup>=0.99). Furthermore, patients with elevated preoperative serum CEA levels (&gt;2.5 ng/mL) fluoresced during surgery with mean TBR of 2.45(SD 0.32) (R<sup>2</sup>=0.99).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The extent of biomarker staining in preoperative biopsy specimens can possibly predict the success of IMI-guided pulmonary resections using OTL38 and CD66e tracers. Preoperative biomarker levels could be used as a selection factor for IMI candidacy in future clinical trials and IMI guided resections

This study aims to compare perioperative outcomes by race after robotic-assisted pulmonary lobectomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively analyzed 705 consecutive patients who underwent robotic-assisted pulmonary lobectomy by one surgeon at one institution over 10.8 years. Patients were grouped by race. Primary outcomes were skin-to-skin operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), chest tube (CT) duration, hospital length of stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included intra-operative and post-operative complications. Patient demographic characteristics, preoperative comorbidities, and tumor characteristics were analyzed. Outcomes were analyzed by Wilcoxon Two-Sample Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test, or Chi-Square Test, with p&le;0.05 as significant. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare survival in months by race.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 705 total patients, there were 657 White, 18 Black, 12 Asian/Pacific Islander (API), 3 Native American/Alaskan (NAA), and 15 Other Race. Due to the small sample sizes, patients were grouped as White (n=657) and Non-White (n=48) race. Race groups significantly differed in mean age (White=68.7 yr, Non-White=62.7 yr; p=0.0056), mean preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second as a percentage (FEV1%) of predicted at the time of surgery (White=87.8%, Non-White=97.8%, p=0.0005), and preoperative hyperlipidemia (White=45.3%, Non-White=27.1%

, p=0.0141). Race groups significantly differed in postoperative arrhythmia (White=20.9%, Non-White=6.3%; p=0.041), true postoperative (not present preoperatively) atrial fibrillation (White=12.5%, Non-White=2.1%; p=0.0309), postoperative mucous plug requiring bronchoscopy (White=4.0%, Non-White=12.5%); p=0.017), median CT duration (White=4 days, Non-White=3 days; p=0.0081), and median hospital LOS (White=4 days, Non-White=3 days; p=0.0345). There were no significant racial differences in any intraoperative complications, EBL or skin-to-skin operative time, or any other postoperative complications between the two groups. Kaplan-Meier curves did not show any significant difference in overall survival.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Following robotic-assisted pulmonary lobectomy, Non-White patients were more likely to have postoperative mucous plugs than White patients, while White patients were more likely to have postoperative arrhythmia and postoperative atrial fibrillation and had longer median chest tube duration and hospital LOS than Non-White patients. Multivariable analysis accounting for preoperative differences between race groups is the next step to further understand these differences in peri-operative outcomes by race.

No studies have investigated the effects of the introduction and widespread adoption of rideshare services on the number of organ donors available from motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) and the effect on the overall donor pool. We hypothesize that the number of deceased donors from MVAs has decreased with the introduction of rideshare services and has also significantly decreased with their widespread adoption. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOs) database was retrospectively reviewed from 9/29/87 to 3/5/21 for deceased donors. Only pediatric donors were excluded (age&lt;15). Donors were analyzed by the circumstance of death, which included: MVA, suicide, homicide, non-MVA accident, natural causes, and &#39;other&#39;. The launch of the major rideshare service in the United States occurred on 7/15/10. This service was available in 100 cities in April 2014 and in 500 cities in December 2016. Data were analyzed in a continuous manner, and then 4 major adoption periods were considered: pre-launch, launch-to-narrow adoption, narrow-to-wide adoption, and post-wide adoption.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The circumstance of death for 218,606 deceased donors was available and was included in our analysis. The donors were 60% male, 71% white, and the mean deceased age was 42 years. MVA proportion of death decreased 5% (p&lt;0.001) from the launch-to-narrow adoption period (16%), compared to pre-launch (21%). The proportion of death decreased to 14% (p&lt;0.001) during the narrow-to-wide adoption period and to 12% (p&lt;0.001) during the wide adoption period. Figure 1 shows stacked percentages of the various circumstances of death in a continuous manner. Of note: homicides, suicides, and non-MVA accidents were not consistently recorded until 1994, and natural causes until 2001. This graph demonstrates a notable drop in MVA percentages beginning after the launch of rideshare services with steady declines continuing to the period of wide adoption. While absolute numbers of MVA donors has steadily increased since 2014, the other deceased donor categories have increased at a higher rate. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The invention and adoption of rideshare services is associated with a decrease in the proportion of organ donors from MVAs.

We hypothesized that geriatric women would have decreased tolerance for NAC than younger patients, and present our data on outcome, tolerance, and toxicity of NAC in this population.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A single institution review of TNBC and Her2+ patients &ge;70 years treated with NAC 2000-2019 was conducted. Demographic, comorbidity, treatment, and toxicity variables were collected. Eligible patients were &ge;70 years, female, received NAC, and had TNBC or Her2+ breast cancer. Log-rank tests and Cox regression visualized survival outcomes and evaluated associations with clinical and demographic variables. Descriptive statistics were performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 43 patients, mean age of diagnosis was 74 years (range 70-85), median BMI 27kg/m<sup>2 </sup>(range 18-40), and mean follow up time 59 months (range 12-180). Patients had TNBC (61%) or Her2+ breast cancer (40%), with most T2 (63%) and N1(53%). Most NAC regimens were Adriamycin (44%) or Herceptin (40%) based. Dose reduction occurred in 6/42 (14%) cases, with 2/6 dose reduced cases also discontinuing NAC early. Early discontinuation occurred in 10/43 (23%) cases, often due to toxicity (8/10). NAC toxicities occurred in 35/43 (81%) patients, mostly neutropenia (74%, 31/42) and neuropathy (21%, 9/43). Average left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) change was -3% (Table). Following NAC, T stage decreased in 67%, stayed the same in 30%, and increased in 2% of patients; N stage decreased in 29%, stayed the same in 48%, and increased in 24% of patients. Cancer recurrence occurred in 16% of patients, more often distant (12%) than local (5%). ECOG scores were primarily 0 at diagnosis (80%), post-NAC (65%), and post-treatment (67%). The highest ECOG score reported was 2. ECOG scores did not predict early discontinuation; however, an ECOG of 2 post-treatment was associated with worse overall survival (HR 28.9 (4.5-183.9)) and worse recurrence-free survival (HR 11.4 (1.9-67.4)). Cancer recurrence (HR 12.6 (2.3-69.5)), especially distant recurrence (HR 16.7 (2.7-103.4)), and larger clinical tumor size (HR 1.04 (1.0-1.1)) were also associated with worse overall survival.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: NAC was effective in reducing clinical tumor stage for most geriatric TNBC or Her2+ breast cancer patients, but many patients experienced at least one chemotherapy-related toxicity, leading to dose reduction and early discontinuation in some patients. Higher post-treatment ECOG scores were associated with worse overall survival and worse recurrence-free survival, suggesting more severe treatment toxicity may be associated with poorer outcome.

In the setting of rising healthcare costs and campaigns aimed at reducing low-value care, recognition of cancer overtreatment has increased with associated recommendations to avoid low-value cancer treatments that can be harmful and costly without improving survival. The extent to which avoidance of low-value care has been incorporated in cancer quality measures is unknown. We aimed to characterize current cancer quality measures endorsing avoiding low-value care services. Secondarily, we identified gaps in current quality measures and provide recommendations for the development and implementation of low-value quality measures.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We systematically identified breast, colon, lung, and prostate cancer quality measures from leading quality measure organizations (i.e., NQF and NQMC). We then categorized those measures focused on reducing low-value care and classified these measures as targeting low-value screening, diagnostic testing and staging, treatment, surveillance, or clinical outcomes.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We analyzed 147 quality measures from 6 organizations. Of these 23% (n=34) involved avoidance of low-value care. Breast cancer had the most measures targeting avoidance of low-value care (n=12 [35.3%]), followed by lung (n=9 [26.5%]), colon (n=8 [23.5%]), and prostate (n=5 [14.7%]) cancer. Overall, the largest percentage of these measures centered on treatments (n=13 [38.2%]), followed by diagnostic testing and staging (n=7 [20.6%]), surveillance (n=6 [17.6%]), screening (n=5 [14.7%]), and clinical outcomes (n=3 [8.8%]).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Leading cancer quality measure organizations have endorsed some measures aimed at reducing low-value services. Many other evidence-based low-value recommendations have not been incorporated. Barriers include the difficulty in measuring appropriateness and subsequently developing a reliable, valid, and practical quality measure.

Karakousis<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania, Department Of Surgery, Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Full oncologic resection via right hemicolectomy (RHC) to obtain appropriate lymph node staging is currently recommended for patients with non-mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix (NMACA). However, it is unclear whether a group of patients exist with early NMACA who may be at low risk of developing LN metastases, and thus might be amenable to a less extensive resection without compromising outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The National Cancer Database was used to perform a retrospective analysis (2004-2016) of patients with NMACA without distant metastases who underwent margin negative surgical resection via either an RHC or appendectomy/partial colectomy (A/PC) and had at least 1 lymph node evaluated. Patients with lymph node metastases were compared to those without lymph node metastases to identify factors prognostic for nodal spread. Multivariable survival analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Five-year overall survival (OS) outcomes were compared between patients who underwent RHC versus A/PC using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 2,866 patients evaluated, 842 (29.4%) had nodal metastases. T4 T-stage (odds ratio [OR] 3.4, p=0.012), poorly/undifferentiated histology (OR 1.9, p=0.045), and lymphovascular invasion ([LVI], OR 4.3, p&lt;0.001) were significantly associated with nodal metastasis. Forty-nine patients had tumors at low-risk for lymph node positivity (T1 T-stage tumors with well-differentiated histology and without LVI), and among this low-risk group, the rate of lymph node positivity was 2.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36%-10.69%). Conversely, among the 2,817 non-low-risk patients, the rate of lymph node positivity was 29.9% (95% CI 28.19%-31.57%). Twelve (24.5%) and 619 (22.0%) patients with low risk and non-low-risk tumors, respectively, underwent A/PC. No significant difference was observed between RHC and A/PC patients in regard to likelihood of treatment with adjuvant systemic therapy (OR 0.97, p=0.811). On multivariable survival analysis of the entire cohort incorporating patient, tumor and treatment factors, performance of A/PC as compared to RHC was associated with a survival disadvantage (hazard ratio 1.47, p=0.047) However, among patients with low-risk disease, 5-year OS did not significantly differ based on the type of surgical resection performed (83.3% A/PC vs. 88.9% RHC, log-rank p=0.726) (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Early NMACA with favorable features (T1 T-stage, well-differentiated tumors without LVI) appears to be associated with a very low risk of lymph node positive disease. These patients may be spared the morbidity of more extensive surgery without compromising outcomes.

Increasing comorbidities have been associated with later stage presentation and worse outcomes for other cancers, but the impact of comorbidity level on presentation patterns for patients with melanoma is not well described. We hypothesized that higher levels of comorbidities would correlate with later stage presentation for these patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to perform a retrospective review of patients diagnosed cutaneous melanoma between 2004-2017. Patients with increasing comorbidities (Charlson-Deyo comorbidity composite score [CDCC] &ge;3) were compared to those with fewer comorbidities (CDCC &lt;3) using multivariable logistic regression analysis. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 372,108 patients evaluated, 2,980 (0.8%) had CDCC &ge;3. Patients with CDCC &ge;3 were significantly more likely to be older (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, p&lt;0.001), male (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, p&lt;0.001), have Medicaid (OR 3.3, p&lt;0.001) or Medicare (OR 2.1, p&lt;0.001) insurance, have lentigo maligna histology (OR 1.2, p=0.008), have truncal tumors (OR 1.2, p=0.006), and to present with stage II (OR 1.3, p&lt;0.001), stage III (OR 1.5, p&lt;0.001) or stage IV (OR 2.0, p&lt;0.001) disease (Table 1). Among the 227,596 patients with clinical stage I/II disease, patients with CDCC &ge;3 were significantly more likely to present with thicker (median thickness 1.25mm CDCC &ge;3 vs. 0.82mm CDCC &lt;3, OR 1.0, p&lt;0.001) and ulcerated (OR 1.2, p=0.002) tumors, were significantly less likely to undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy when presenting with &ge;T1b T-stage (OR 1.4, p=0.042), and among those who had a sentinel lymph node biopsy performed, were significantly more likely to have a positive biopsy (OR 1.4, p=0.001). Patients with CDCC &ge;3 were significantly less likely to receive systemic therapy (OR 0.76, p=0.007), and among those who underwent surgery, had a longer period of time until their first surgical procedure (mean number of days between diagnosis and first operation 13.6 CDCC &ge;3 vs. 10.3 CDCC &lt;3, OR 1.0, p=0.003).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Increasing patient comorbidities are associated with more advanced stage melanoma at diagnosis. Comprehensive skin examinations as a part of routine health maintenance efforts may aide in diagnosing melanoma at early stages, thereby altering treating options and prognosis among this high-risk patient cohort.

Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines advocate for use of neoadjuvant radiation for stage II/III tumors. We sought to examine factors associated with utilization and trends of radiation overall, and neoadjuvant radiation specifically, in a national cohort of patients with ESTS. 

 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: ESTS patients eligible for radiation therapy (stage II/III) who underwent surgical excision were identified from the 2004-2016 National Cancer Database. Patients who received radiation were compared to those who did not, using multivariable logistic regression analysis. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing patients who received neoadjuvant versus adjuvant radiation. Joinpoint regression was used to evaluate trends in radiation receipt. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 10,074 patients with ESTS (55.2% male, median age 62 years), 6,361 (63.1%) received radiation, the minority of whom (n=2,415, 38.0%) received neoadjuvant radiation. Receipt of neoadjuvant radiation was associated with younger age (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90-1.00), larger tumor size (OR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00-1.00), negative margins (OR 2.85, 95% CI 2.35-3.46), treatment at a high-volume center (HVC) (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.78-2.52), and no adjuvant systemic therapy (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.43-2.17). Across the study period, usage of overall radiation (APC 0.46, p&lt;0.01) and neoadjuvant radiation specifically (APC 5.37, p&lt;0.01) increased, the latter particularly among patients over 65 (APC 5.88, p&lt;0.01). Use of neoadjuvant radiation increased in both LVCs (APC 9.58, p&lt;0.01) and HVCs (APC 4.50, p&lt;0.01). Despite these increasing trends, in the last year of the study period, a minority of patients (44.5%) received neoadjuvant radiation. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The use of radiation in the treatment of ESTS is increasing with a shift towards neoadjuvant radiation as per guideline recommendations, highlighted particularly in the elderly population and in low volume centers. However, only a minority of patients with ESTS are receiving neoadjuvant radiation. Further study into the barriers to implementation of neoadjuvant radiation is required.

Correa-Gallego<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>New York University School Of Medicine, Surgery, New York, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Time to treatment (TTT) varies widely for patients with gastric cancer and is influenced by factors at the patient, provider, and health-system levels. We aimed to evaluate the relationships between time to treatment, overall survival (OS), and other surgical outcomes in patients with Stage I-III gastric cancer.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We identified patients with clinical Stage I-III gastric cancer who underwent curative-intent gastrectomy within the National Cancer Database (2006-2015) and grouped them by treatment sequence: neoadjuvant or surgery upfront. We defined TTT as weeks from diagnosis to start of treatment (neoadjuvant chemotherapy and definitive surgical procedure, respectively). Minimum P value was used to establish a TTT cut-point for each treatment sequence group. Survival differences were assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimate, Cox proportional hazard regression, and log rank test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among the 22,914 patients with Stage I-III gastric cancer, median age at diagnosis was 66 (IQR 57-74) with 31% female, 79% White, and 39% privately insured patients. Most patients (56%) received surgery upfront; 35% of those patients received adjuvant therapy. More than half (55%) of patients with clinical T2 or higher disease or node positive disease received neoadjuvant therapy.

Median TTT was 5 weeks (IQR 4-7) for patients who received neoadjuvant treatment and 6 weeks (IQR 3-9) for patients who underwent surgery upfront. Longer TTT (&gt;10 weeks for patients who received neoadjuvant, &gt;2 weeks for patients who underwent surgery upfront) was associated with longer median OS (Table). This relationship persisted after adjusting for age at diagnosis, Charlson-Deyo score, pathologic stage, grade, care at multiple facilities, type of hospital, and hospital location (Table). Post-surgical mortality was higher among patients who underwent surgery upfront than those who received neoadjuvant (30-day: 4% vs 2%, 90-day: 7% vs 5%; p&lt;0.001).

Patients who underwent surgery upfront with longer TTT were more likely to have &ge;15 lymph nodes examined and negative resection margins (Table). Post-surgical 30- and 90-day mortality of patients with longer TTT was half that of patients with shorter TTT (Table). There were no significant differences in these outcomes between shorter and longer TTT in the neoadjuvant group.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Shorter TTT was significantly associated with worse OS for the entire cohort and worse oncologic outcomes and post-surgical mortality among patients who underwent surgery upfront. While most patients received guideline-recommended neoadjuvant treatment, for patients who underwent surgery upfront, these data suggest that a lengthier time to treatment does not negatively impact OS or other post-surgical outcomes.

In some cases, elevated cancer incidence is attributable to carcinogenic processes; however, increasing diagnostic scrutiny or use of screening technologies can drive detection of indolent disease &ndash; a phenomenon known as overdiagnosis. When not recognized, overdiagnosis can lead to overtreatment. We hypothesized that the distribution of elevated cancer risk associated with different medical diagnoses or exposures could shed light on the contribution of overdiagnosis to cases of elevated cancer incidence. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A systematic PubMed literature search was performed to identify studies published within the past 30 years that examined the association between a condition and an elevated risk of cancer reported as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). For each underlying diagnosis or exposure, meta-SIRs for each cancer type were calculated. Comparisons were made between cancer types reported to be subject to some degree of overdiagnosis (thyroid, breast, melanoma, lung, prostate cancers), and cancer types that have not been associated with overdiagnosis (gastric, head and neck, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers). 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We reviewed 108 studies, and identified 2 patterns of elevated cancer SIR: 1) SIR elevated for both overdiagnosed and non-overdiagnosed cancer types, and 2) SIR elevated only for overdiagnosed cancer types. Examples of pattern #1 included germline mutation carrier status, childhood radiation exposure, medication exposure, and organ transplant. Examples of pattern #2 included a history of prior cancer, synchronous cancer, rheumatologic diagnoses, and certain occupations lacking known hazardous exposures. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Persons with occupational/environmental exposures or concurrent medical conditions may have an elevated risk of developing cancer. We found that the distribution of elevated cancer risks is a signature of whether the underlying mechanism is a carcinogenic process, or a result of increased diagnostic scrutiny or screening practices. For example, certain known cancer risk factors exhibited pattern #1. In contrast, increased exposure to medical surveillance as a result of other medical diagnoses or certain occupations were generally associated with pattern #2. For this reason, the identification of increased cancer risk should be viewed with caution. Analyzing the pattern of elevated cancer risk distribution can reveal conditions that appear to be cancer risk factors but are in fact the sequelae of exposure to medical surveillance, diagnostic imaging, or other healthcare activities that lead to the detection of indolent tumors.

Clarke<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Medical College Of Wisconsin, Surgical Oncology, Milwaukee, WI, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Medical College Of Wisconsin, Dermatology, Milwaukee, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Effective treatment of malignant melanomas is dependent upon accurate histopathological staging by the preoperative biopsy specimens. While narrow excision down to subcutaneous fat is the gold standard for melanoma diagnosis, superficial shave biopsies can be performed faster than an excisional biopsy and have become the preferred method of diagnosis by dermatologists due to low costs, simplicity and efficiency. The use of shave biopsies can, however, result in transection of the malignant lesion resulting in inaccurate Breslow depth and T-stage, and potentially negatively impact clinical management. Current AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> edition staging, emphasizes Breslow depth in thin (&ge;0.8 mm) melanomas as the main indication for sentinel lymph node biopsy. This study aims to describe the types and frequency of skin biopsy methods in patients referred to a single-institution, large-volume center for surgical treatment of malignant melanoma with close attention to the frequency of positive deep margin, inaccurate initial T-stage and consequent impact on surgical planning and treatment recommendations. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients referred to the Medical College of Wisconsin between January 2015 and December 2018 for treatment of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma. Accuracy of initial biopsy in T-staging and the potential impact on indications for definitive surgical treatment were assessed using complete narrow excision as the gold standard.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Two hundred fifty-four (254) patients had complete data for analysis. Shave biopsy was the most common method of initial biopsy in 182 (72%) patients, followed by punch biopsy in 55 (22%) patients and excisional biopsy in 17 (7%) patients diagnosed with melanoma from extremity (n= 104, 41%), trunk (n=72, 28%), and head or neck (n=78,31%). Median (IQR) Breslow thickness was 0.63 (0.7) mm; 3.6% of lesions were ulcerated. 26 (14.2%) shave biopsies were associated with a positive deep margin. At the time of wide excision, residual melanoma was found in 42% of surgical specimen, resulting in T-stage upstaging for 12 of 182 (7%) patients undergoing shave biopsies. 4 of 55 (7%) punch biopsies underestimated T-stage. Recommendations for wide excision margin or sentinel lymph node biopsy changed in 15 of 254 (6%) patient, 12 of 182 shave biopsies (7%), and 3 of 55 (5%) punch biopsies.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Shave biopsy is the most frequent method of diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma. The use of shave biopsy may compromise treatment recommendations in up to 7% of patients. However, in the vast majority of cases, shave biopsy is effective and accurate in diagnosing and determining T-stage in cutaneous melanoma.

However, rare cases of T1 gastric cancer are associated with poor outcomes, including nodal metastasis.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data from gastric cancer patients undergoing surgery at a single tertiary care institution between the years of 2010 and 2020 were analyzed. Patients with early stage (T1) disease were assessed in detail to identify variables associated with regional lymph node metastasis including histologic differentiation, signet ring cells, demographics, smoking history, neoadjuvant therapy, and clinical staging by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). We used standard statistical techniques including Mann Whitney U and Chi-Squared tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 426 patients undergoing surgery for gastric cancer, 34% (n= 146) were diagnosed with T1 disease on final pathology. Among 146 T1 (T1a, T1b) gastric cancers, 24 patients [(17%) T1a (n=4), T1b (n=20)] had histologically confirmed regional lymph node metastases. The age at diagnosis ranged between 19 to 91 and 54.8% were male. Prior smoking status was not associated with nodal positivity (p= 0.650). Of node positive patients (24/145), 7 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy because locally advanced disease was identified (on CT imaging) or patients had high grade features on endoscopic biopsy. EUS was performed on 91 patients (62%). Of these patients 12 (13.2%) were node positive on final pathology, however none (0/12) were detected on preoperative EUS. There was no association between node status on EUS and node status on final pathology (p=0.113). The sensitivity of EUS for N status was 0%, specificity was 84.4%, negative predictive value (NPV) was 82.2% and positive predictive value (PPV) was 0%. Signet ring cells were identified in 42% of node negative T1 tumors and 64% of node positive T1 tumors (p=0.063). For node positive cases on surgical pathology, 37.5% had poor differentiation, 42% had lymphovascular invasion, and regional nodal metastases were associated with increasing T stage (p=0.003).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: T1 gastric cancer is associated with a substantial risk (17%) of regional lymph node metastasis. The findings of N+ disease on EUS was not significantly associated with N+ disease on final pathology in patients with T1 gastric cancer.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a devastating illness with poor prognosis. In addition to high mortality, patients with PDAC also commonly present with or develop symptoms that greatly decrease quality of life, often requiring multiple hospital admissions and invasive interventions. In 2019, our health system initiated the Pancreas Multidisciplinary Clinic (PMDC), a one stop shop for patients with pancreatic cancer seeking an evaluation by medical, surgical, and radiation oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, gastroenterologists, and palliative care specialists. The objective of this study was to determine if the initiation of a multidisciplinary clinic promoted the palliation of patients presenting with a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Our institutional cancer registry was retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), seen in 2019 (the inaugural year of the PMDC) both within the PMDC and at all other health system sites were included. Demographics and categorical variables presented as frequencies. T or Chi-square exact tests were used as appropriate for univariate analysis, logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of 175 patients with PDAC, 47% were men, 66% were white, 20% were African American, and 5% were Asian. At diagnosis, 19% were Stage 1, 9% Stage 2, 17% Stage 3, and 54% Stage 4. Patients presented with or developed various symptoms during the course of their illness: 78% developed abdominal pain, 40% had weight loss, 21% venous thromboembolism, and 2% new-onset diabetes. Treatments administered included: 61% pain control, 27% Creon, 35% biliary stenting, and 3% surgical biliary or enteric bypass. 21% of patients were seen at PMDC. PMDC patients were more likely to receive referral to a nutritionist (p=0.002) or a psycho oncologist (p=0.035); and more likely to receive Creon prescription (p&lt;0.001), compared to those not seen at PMDC. In both groups, palliative consultation for Stage 4 disease was significantly higher (p=0.039) when compared to other stages.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While palliative care consultation was more common in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, symptom management and psychosocial support were offered irrespective of disease stage. Patients seen at the PMDC were more likely to receive and benefit from supportive care.

We aim to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of these procedures with enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) strategy implementation in these pediatric patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Children aged younger than 18 with massive splenomegaly secondary to hereditary spherocytosis, who underwent concurrent laparoscopic splenectomy and cholecystectomy at our institution, were retrospectively analyzed. Outcomes including spleen size, length of stay, pain management, postoperative ambulation, and regular diet initiation were examined.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Four patients with hereditary spherocytosis underwent concurrent laparoscopic splenectomy and cholecystectomy for massive splenomegaly and cholelithiasis, respectively. The smallest patient was 7 years old and weighed 20.8 kg. All patients received minimal intraoperative opioids, started a regular diet immediately postoperatively, maintained on scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) postoperatively, were mobilized, and were encouraged to be active. All patients were discharged on postoperative day 1 without complications.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: All patients positively benefited from ERAS considerations and were safely discharged the day after their operation.

Craniosynostosis is defined as the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures and is estimated to appear in 1 in 2100 to 2500 births. The frontal suture often closes at 6-12 months of age while the other cranial sutures may remain open into adulthood. Craniosynostosis is classified as syndromic or non-syndromic, with the non-syndromic type typically involving a single suture. Due to the structural impact on nearby anatomical features and subsequent risk of increased intracranial pressure, craniosynostosis patients may present with consequent ophthalmological diagnoses [OD; strabismus, papilledema, exophthalmos, etc.], though associations have also been reported with developmental delays (DD), obstructive sleep apnea (SA), chronic otitis media (OM), hearing loss (HL), chronic headaches (HD), and seizure disorders (SD). Studies have shown a male preponderance of 2:1 in overall incidence of craniosynostosis; however, no studies assess sex differences in comorbidities of the diagnosis, particularly regarding age at presentation. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

This is a retrospective chart review across two medical centers over an 8 year time period of children (1 month to 9 years of age) with a diagnosis of non-syndromic craniosynostosis that underwent an ophthalmology exam. We investigated the association of a primary craniosynostosis diagnosis (i.e., sagittal, coronal, metopic, or pansynostosis) with any OD, along with the presence of other common comorbidities (OM, DD, HL, SA, HD, and SD) at the time of presentation. Craniosynostosis patients were compared to a similarly-aged trauma control group representing the normal population. Differences in outcomes among craniosynostosis patients based on sex were explored using the multivariate Welch t-test based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

175 craniosynostosis patients fit the inclusion criteria and were compared to 249 trauma patients (controls). Of the 175 craniosynostosis patients, 109 (62%) were male and 66 (38%) were female with a mean age of 14&plusmn; 14 months. A diagnosis of craniosynostosis was significantly associated with OD (p&lt;0.0001), OM (p&lt;0.0001), DD (p&lt;0.0001), and HL (p&lt;0.005). There were significant differences in outcomes among craniosynostosis patients based on sex (Figure 1a). Female patients were more likely to present with OD (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.67, p = 0.01) or HL (OR = 0.24 95% CI 0.07 to 0.72, p &lt; 0.01) than males (Figure 1b). Subgroup analysis by age demonstrated consistently higher rates in females for these outcomes.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Our findings expand on current literature to suggest potential sex differences in craniosynostosis comorbidities and serve to educate physicians of symptoms that require recognition and prompt management in these patients.

Overman<sup>1</sup>, K. E. Speck<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan, Division Of Pediatric Surgery, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Placement of tunneled central venous catheters (CVC) with external core components (Hickman or Broviac catheters) or implantable ports, remains one of the most common procedures performed in children. However, there is no data-driven guidance on when to offer each line type. We aim to provide information for providers and families to assist in decision making regarding type of line placement in patients under 5 years of age.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single institution retrospective chart review was performed for patients under 5 years of age who underwent initial placement of a tunneled CVC between January 2014 to December 2016 as inclusion. line exchanges were excluded. Data was compared by type of CVC and age and stratified by above and below 10 kilograms (kg), at time of placement. Analysis was done using t-test and chi-squared with significance defined as p &lt; 0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified 145 patients who met inclusion criteria, 56 patients under 10 kg, and 89 patients above 10kg at time of placement. In patients under 10kg, those receiving external-type catheters were younger (.48 years vs 1.06 years p&lt;0.01) and smaller (5.47 kg vs 8.3 kg p&lt;0.01). They also had less early complications (9 vs. 22% p&lt;0.01) but more late complications (45 vs 11 p&lt;0.01) than implantable ports. In patients over 10kg receiving external-type catheters, they were also smaller (13.36 kg vs 14.97 kg p&lt;0.01), however they had more early 8% vs 3% p&lt;0.01) and late (63% vs 22%) complications than those receiving implantable ports. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Long term complications from external-type lines are significant with up to 63% of patients having a complication requiring intervention. While some diagnoses determine line type, there are other indications, such as difficult IV access and intermittent IV infusions, that overlap between the two types of lines where clinical discretion may dictate line type. Our data demonstrate a lower overall complication rate with implantable ports, and suggest they be considered over external-type lines when continuous access is not needed (TPN), even in smaller and younger patients.

Solomon<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, New Haven, CT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Appendicitis accounts for the greatest relative burden of healthcare expenditures among all pediatric surgical conditions. Consequently, identifying value within cost variability for appendicitis treatment represents a significant opportunity for cost savings. We hypothesized that the cost of disposable supplies used for pediatric laparoscopic appendectomy is not inversely correlated with duration of procedure or hospital length of stay (LOS).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Operating room (OR) case logs from the electronic medical record were queried from 3/1/2018 to 3/1/2021 to identify patients who underwent appendectomy for acute, uncomplicated appendicitis at a single children&rsquo;s hospital with seven pediatric surgeons. The hospital&rsquo;s true cost for surgical disposables was recorded for each patient. The institution&rsquo;s National Surgical Quality Improvement Project &ndash; Pediatric database was merged with the OR data to combine quality metrics, including length of stay (LOS) and surgical complication rates for appendectomy. Correlation coefficients were calculated to identify correlation between cost and procedure duration and LOS. Student&rsquo;s t-tests were performed to compare supply cost and procedure duration.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 276 patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy were included in analyses. Average age was 11 years. 51% were male and 50% were publicly insured. Median length of stay for admitted patients was 20 hours. Average operative time was 44 +/- 15 minutes. No occurrences of surgical site infection, postoperative sepsis or postoperative transfusion were recorded. The average cost of disposables was $725 +/- 426 per operation. There was no correlation between cost of disposables and LOS (r = -0.06, p =0.30). Cost of disposables had a weak positive correlation with procedure duration (r = 0.22, p = 0.049; see Figure 1). Energy-based vessel sealing devices and laparoscopic staplers were used in 30% and 38% of cases, respectively. Vessel sealer use was associated with an average cost of $620 more than cases without its use, and no difference in procedure duration (42 vs 43 minutes, p = 0.70). Laparoscopic stapler use was associated with an average cost of $340 more than cases without its use, and longer procedure duration (45 vs 41 minutes, p = 0.019).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Significant variability in the use of disposables for appendectomy exists, even among pediatric surgeons at a single institution. The use of higher technology disposables incrementally increases costs but is not associated with shorter operative times, reduced LOS or improved outcomes for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis. These findings indicate that high quality care is not compromised when surgeons consider value during appendectomy.

Mortellaro<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>The Children's Hospital Of Alabama, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, AL, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Many studies focus on comparing outcomes of the open method for inguinal hernia repair (IHR) and the laparoscopic method. However, there are few studies comparing outcomes of different laparoscopic techniques. With over a dozen different techniques described in literature for laparoscopic IHR, significant opportunities exist to study the efficacy of each technique. We investigated outcomes of a subcutaneous endoscopically assisted ligation technique (Technique 1) and a percutaneous internal ring suturing with 18-gauge needle technique (Technique 2).


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: After receiving institutional review board approval, we completed a retrospective chart review of every IHR performed at our pediatric tertiary care center between September 2015 and May 2020. We included all patients under the age of 18. We separated laparoscopic repairs (n = 255) from total repairs (n = 1614). Laparoscopic repairs were further divided into their respective techniques. Factors involving patient demographics, operative details, and post-operative complications were statistically analyzed using SPSS. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There was a total of 131 IHRs performed with Technique 1 and 123 IHRs performed with Technique 2. Mean operative time (minutes) differed significantly (p=0.004) with Technique 1 at 50&plusmn;28.5 and Technique 2 at 61.3&plusmn;33.2 minutes. Significantly more incarcerated hernias were repaired with Technique 2 (n=13) than with Technique 1 (n=3) (p=0.006). There were no significant differences in the number of concomitant conditions between the 2 techniques (p&gt;0.33). Technique 1 had a higher number of post-operative complications; the most significant were granulomas (n=3, p=0.09) and recurrent hernias (n=12, p=0.002).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The subcutaneous endoscopically assisted ligation technique had a significantly higher number of post-operative complications. This may be a result of multiple factors including, but not limited to, the absence of cautery, a shorter mean operative time, and utilization of an absorbable suture. Modifications have been made to this technique to reduce risk of post-operative complications.

Most existing research focuses primarily on the male pediatric population due to the etiology of indirect inguinal hernias. There are no studies examining outcomes and comorbidities of IHR specifically in pediatric female patients. In this study, we investigated and compared the outcomes of open and laparoscopic IHR in the female pediatric population.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: After receiving institutional review board approval, we completed a retrospective chart review of every IHR performed at our pediatric tertiary care center between September 2015 and May 2020. We included all patients under the age of 18. Female patients were separated from the total patient population. Factors involving patient demographics, operative details, and post-operative complications were statistically analyzed using SPSS.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 215 female patients were identified from a total of 1614 patients during this period. Of these, 154 underwent open repairs compared to 61 laparoscopic repairs. Mean operative time (minutes) for the open and laparoscopic methods are 51.9&plusmn;38.4 and 54.0&plusmn;37.8, respectively (p=0.71). There was a history of prematurity in 53 patients who underwent open repairs and in 22 patients who underwent laparoscopic repairs (p=0.819). The age at operation (months) did not differ significantly between the two methodologies (p=0.609). There was no significant difference between the types of hernia performed between the methods (p&gt;0.125). There were very few post-operative complications that occurred with both methods of repair (p&gt;0.495). There were 2 total recurrent hernias, 1 after open repair and the other after laparoscopic repair.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Open and laparoscopic methodologies are equally efficacious in the pediatric female population. There are no significant differences in mean operative times and post-operative complications.

Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a common gastrointestinal disease in premature infants and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality amongst this patient population. In addition to operative intervention for severe cases, all treatment includes bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics; however, there are no standardized guidelines for duration of therapy, especially in non-operative management of NEC. This study evaluated our institution&#39;s use of antibiotics for NEC for both operative and non-operative patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A retrospective study was conducted of pediatric (age&lt;1 year) NEC cases at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital from January 2018-December 2020. Patient demographics, diagnosis, operative details, treatment plans, and outcomes within 90 days post-operatively were collected from the electronic medical record. Patients who had a confirmed NEC diagnosis and those with suspected NEC were included in the study. Descriptive and univariate analysis was performed.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Of the 99 patients treated for NEC, 49 (49.5%) were male. The median age at diagnosis was 20 (10,41) days with a median weight of 1.25 (0.91,1.92) kilograms. Forty-three (43.4%) patients underwent surgery, while 56 (56.6%) were treated exclusively with antibiotics and bowel rest. The most common antibiotic regimen used was a combination of gentamicin, ampicillin, and flagyl (44.4%), but regimens were variable with 32 different antibiotic regimens being chosen for treatment. Operative patients were more frequently placed on antibiotics for longer than 14 days ((15 (35%) vs. 5 (9%) p=0.001). Non-operative patients were more frequently placed on antibiotics for 7 to 14 days ((38 (68%) vs. 17 (40%) p=0.005). Despite this variability, there was no difference in median total antibiotic duration between operative vs non-operative patients ((10 (6,18) vs. 8 (7,11) p=0.06). Patients who underwent an operation were noted to have more complications ((9 (21%) vs. 4 (7%) p=0.044); however, they did not have an increased length of stay ((80.5 (18.0,157.4) vs. 76.0 (48.4,117.9) p=0.44). In total, 14 (14.1%) patients died from complications directly related to NEC.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Antibiotic therapy for treatment of NEC at our institution was highly variable. Despite this variability, there was no difference in median total antibiotic duration between non-operative vs operative patients. However, operative patients did have more complications. Institutional antibiotic stewardship is needed to create a uniform antibiotic treatment protocol for NEC that provides ease of use for providers and optimizes patient outcomes.

Badru<sup>1</sup>, D. Neal<sup>1</sup>, J. A. Taylor<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Florida, Department Of Surgery, Gainesville, FL, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Florida, Department Of Pediatrics, Gainesville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of prematurity that leads to surgical intervention in about 30% of patients. While abdominal distention alone is not an indication for surgical intervention, its trend, measured via abdominal circumference, can be a helpful adjunct in decision-making. There is currently no defined increase in abdominal circumference that predicts need for surgery. The aim of this study was to define the relationship, if any, between change in abdominal girth and need for surgical intervention for NEC.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An IRB-exempt retrospective chart review of NICU patients from 2015-2020 at a single institution was performed. Patients were identified using ICD-10 code for NEC. Inclusion criteria were gestational age (GA) &lt; 37 weeks and confirmed pneumatosis and/or portal venous gas on x-ray. Exclusion criteria were multiple NEC episodes during admission, major congenital anomalies, and outborn patients transferred for NEC. Demographic data, daily largest abdominal girth, and routine laboratory data were recorded for every day of the patients&rsquo; NEC treatment. Average daily percent change in abdominal girth was calculated. Largest percent change from the first abdominal girth of NEC episode was calculated as well as the number of days between day 1 and the day of largest percent change. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests (p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 178 identified patients, 43 were included in the final analysis. 30 (70%) were medically managed and 13 (30%) underwent surgical intervention. There was a statistically significant difference in the average daily percent change in abdominal girth between the medical and surgical patients in the &lt;30 week GA and the &gt;30 week GA group; this significance persisted when analyzing the patients based on &lt;1000g and &gt;1000g birth weight. There was a statistically significant difference in overall largest percent change from the first abdominal girth measurement in both GA groups. Regarding threshold of girth increase predictive of needing surgical intervention, there was no significance found. Laboratory data analysis did not yield any correlations. Further subgrouping by GA and weight did not yield sample sizes large enough for appropriate statistical analysis.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Changes in abdominal girth differ significantly between medical NEC and surgical NEC cases. This study was limited by small sample size, particularly when attempting subgroup analysis. Establishing a threshold for percent change in abdominal girth would be valuable for NEC management protocols, regarding decision-making for timing of surgical intervention. While this could not be determined within this patient sample, any increase in girth put the patient at risk for needing surgery. Based on this, following abdominal girths should continue to be a data point included in the medical management and surgical decision-making for premature infants with NEC.

Gray<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Indiana University School Of Medicine, Department Of Surgery, Indianapolis, IN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The optimal feeding strategy for post-operative neonatal patients with congenital bowel obstruction or bowel atresia is widely debated. Growing literature demonstrates that earlier introduction of enteral nutrition leads to faster return of bowel function, decreased post-operative complications, and shorter hospital stays. This study aims to review perioperative characteristics and post-operative nutritional practices for patients with congenital bowel obstruction/atresia repair. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This IRB-approved study is a retrospective review of neonatal patients (&lt;30 days old) admitted to a pediatric referral hospital in Indiana who underwent an operation for bowel obstruction between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, length of time to initiation of enteric feeds, and liberation from TPN were collected. The associations between early enteral nutrition (EEN), defined as enteric feeds within 5 post-operative days, and nutrition and perioperative characteristics were analyzed with SAS 9.4.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 97 neonates with neonatal bowel obstruction, 36 patients received EEN. Gender, gestational age, and ethnicity were similar between groups. EEN patients were more likely to present with malrotation or annular pancreas and less with meconium plug or gastroschisis (p&lt;0.025). Patients in the EEN group were likely to have a shorter operation (1.48 vs 1.82 hours, p&lt;0.042). Both groups received preoperative TPN, but patients receiving EEN liberated from TPN in the post-operative period earlier (9 vs. 17 days, p &lt; 0.005). Receiving EEN was associated with shorter median hospital stay (16 vs. 29 days, p &lt; 0.0001). Weight gain velocities at the two-month follow up were significantly greater for the EEN patients (8.02 vs 7.00 g/kg/day, p&lt;0.043) with the difference minimizing at six and twelve months (Figure 1). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Earlier initiation of enteral nutrition in the post-operative period was more likely in patients with certain operative diagnoses and was associated with improved outcomes. Creating and methodically implementing an early enteral nutrition protocol in congenitally obstructed neonates may lead to shorter hospital stays, decreased resource utilization, and improved outcomes for neonates with congenital bowel obstruction.

Diefenbach<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Nationwide Children's Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, Columbus, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has many potential benefits, but its use for repairing neonatal congenital anomalies, such as duodenal atresia (DA), is not yet widely applied. While advantages of a MIS approach include improved visualization, fewer adhesions, and improved cosmetic appearance of the incisions, increased operative times due to the learning curve in utilizing laparoscopy is the main disadvantage. We aimed to compare our single institution outcomes of open versus MIS approach for DA repair over the last nine years.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing DA repair from January 2012 to December 2020 was performed. IRB approval was not required as this was part of a larger quality improvement project. Demographic, perioperative, and postoperative variables were collected and compared between patients who underwent open versus MIS repair. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables, while Chi-squared test was used to compare categorical variables.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 67 patients total, including 44 in the open group and 23 in the MIS group. While more patients in the MIS group were female (65.2% vs 38.6%, p=0.04), there was no difference in ethnicity (78.3% vs 65.9%, p=0.30), congenital heart disease (39.1% vs 34.1%, p=0.69), presence of Trisomy 21 (30.4% vs 40.9%, p=0.40), or weight at time of surgery (2.4 kilograms (IQR 1.9, 2.8) vs 2.6 kilograms (2.0, 3.0), p=0.10)) compared to the open cohort. The median operative time was significantly longer in the MIS group (183 min (IQR 148, 203) vs 128.5 min (IQR 101.5, 150.3), p&lt;0.001) compared to the open group. While the length of stay was 14 days shorter in the MIS group, this did not reach statistical significance.

Postoperatively, the total complication rate (27.3% vs 4.3%, p=0.025) and reoperation rate (22.7% vs 4.3%, p=0.05) were significantly higher in the open group compared to the MIS group, respectively (Table 1). There was one mortality in each group; both patients required a reoperation for stricture/leak but ultimately succumbed to other congenital comorbidities.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Performance of duodenal atresia repair through a minimally invasive approach can be performed safely, with fewer complications, and decreased risk of reoperation compared to an open approach. While a learning curve leading to longer operative times has been recognized, this time difference was less than an hour and may be offset by advantages in postoperative outcomes.

Current data is inconclusive when comparing operative time, length of stay, postoperative pain requirements, and postoperative complications between single port and multiple port techniques. The objective of this study is to compare efficacy, safety and outcomes of 1-port, 2-port and 3-port access in the treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis in pediatric patients at a single institution.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective study was conducted utilizing the ACS NSQIP-P database for laparoscopic appendectomies performed for acute uncomplicated disease from 01/2015 to 06/2020. Patients with prolonged stays due to medical reasons and complicated appendicitis were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed for operative technique (1-port, 2-port, and 3-port), 30-day readmission and ED visits, surgical site infections, intra-abdominal abscesses, opioid use, and same day/next day discharge. Data was analyzed using chi-squared analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 583 pediatric patients included in this study, 38 (6.5%) underwent 1-port, 122 (20.9%) underwent 2-port, and 423 (72.6%) underwent 3-port laparoscopic appendectomies. There was a statistically significant difference in total operative time (minutes) between 1-port, 2-port, and 3-port operative technique (50.5, 37.0, and 48.0, respectively, p&lt;0.0001); in same day discharge (13.2%, 29.5%, 14.4%, respectively, p&lt;0.0004); and in 30-day return ED visits (18.4%, 7.4%, 5.7%, respectively, p&lt;0.015).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Trends in pediatric surgery in favor of single port appendectomies are supported from small single institutional studies. Our review demonstrated an increase in operative time, length of stay, and in 30-day return to ED visits when using the single port technique compared to the 2-port and 3-port technique. A multi-institutional review would be beneficial to further analyze these outcomes.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is associated with pulmonary hypoplasia, pulmonary hypertension, and increased neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although intrathoracic liver herniation &gt;20% is associated with adverse outcomes, the relationship between liver herniation &lt;20% and outcomes is poorly characterized.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A single-center retrospective review was performed from 2004-2020 of 167 fetuses with left-sided CDH that were delivered and underwent repair at our institution. Perinatal, perioperative, and postoperative data were collected. The maximum percent liver herniation throughout gestation was used for analysis. The subjects were stratified into groups with 0-10%, 10-20%, and &gt;20% liver herniation. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance, unpaired t-tests, and chi-squared analyses.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of all left-sided CDH subjects, 51 (30.5%) had 0-10% liver herniation, 27 (16.2%) had 10-20%, and 89 (53.3%) had &gt;20% herniation. Comparing the 0-10% vs. 10-20% group, there were significant differences between repair on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (11.4% vs 38.1%, p=0.02), repair with patch (48.9% vs. 81.0%, p=0.02), and length of stay (29 vs 98 days, p&lt;0.01). Comparing the 10-20% vs. &gt;20% group, no significant difference was observed among these outcomes: repair on ECMO (38.1% vs. 53.9%, p=0.32), repair with patch (81.0% vs. 93.7%, p=0.10), and length of stay (98 vs. 99 days, p=0.51), however a difference was shown in use of diuretics at discharge (14.3% vs. 42.0%, p=0.03).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While 20% liver herniation in CDH has been associated with poor long-term pulmonary sequelae, liver herniation of 10-20% is associated with increased surgical complexity and post-operative management of pulmonary sequelae in comparison to lower herniation percentages. Further risk stratification in CDH by percent liver herniation may help improve prenatal counseling and care for this population.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over the 5y timespan, 686 patients underwent gastrostomy tube placement. Median age was 0.63 years (IQR 0.25-1.96; 52% male, 44% Caucasian, 44% African-American, and 5.25% Hispanic; 75% public insurance). The most common comorbidities were neurologic (51.6%), congenital anomalies (45.8%), prematurity (33.7%), and respiratory (32.9%). The most common indications for gastrostomy placement were dysphagia (35.0%), failure to thrive (19.1%), feeding intolerance (14.4%), and aspiration/apnea with feeding (6.9%). Most patients were inpatients (90.5%; 63% on the floor; 26% NICU).

 

UGI was obtained in 90.8% of patients, of which 23.6% of studies were abnormal. The most common abnormal findings were reflux (13.8%) and abnormal anatomy (5.8%). The median time to obtain an UGI was 1.07 days (IQR 0.22-1.05). Obtaining an UGI delayed time from consultation to surgery in 104 patients (15.2%). If a delay was encountered, median time was 2.47 days (IQR 1.86-2.99). Ladd&rsquo;s procedures were performed in 12 patients (1.7%) found to have malrotation on UGI. None of the 63 patients who did not undergo UGI required a Ladd&rsquo;s procedure.

 

Patients that had an UGI did not experience an increase in overall length of stay (57.17 vs 78.89 days, p=0.165), operative time (47 vs 56 min, p=0.13), or a decrease in rate of operative complications (11.5% vs 14.3%, p=0.75). Additionally, UGI did not have a significant impact on total adjusted costs ($153,771 vs 195,644 without UGI, p=0.36) or total adjusted costs per day ($2,419 vs 2,293 without UGI, p=0.11).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: UGI prior to gastrostomy placement in children rarely identified abnormal findings that changed the operative plan, occasionally increased time from consultation to surgery, but did not significantly impact operative time, length of stay, complication rates, or total adjusted costs. Further analysis to identify subsets of children that may benefit from routine UGI are warranted.

Mary<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Ohio State University, Surgery, Columbus, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Previous reviews of pyloromyotomy outcomes in infants display a trend toward increased utilization of laparoscopy and a persistent complication rate of 3-5%. We sought to perform a contemporary analysis of surgical approach and outcomes for infant pyloromyotomy in facilities with established pediatric surgery programs. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Pediatric National Quality Improvement Project&#39;s Partipant Use File (NSQIP PUF) was queried from 2016-2019. Utilization of laparoscopy was trended over time. Complication rates and length of stay were analyzed by operative approach.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 7834 pyloromyotomies were included in the analysis. The utilization of laparoscopy steadily increased over time (66% to 77%). Lenth of stay was signficantly shorter for laparoscopy (1.85 days vs. 1.67 days), but of questionable clinical signficance. Individual complication rates did not vary by approach. Overall complication rates were lower than previously reported (2.04%). This neared, but did not reach statistical significance based on approach (2.56% open vs. 1.84% lap, p 0.051).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In facilities reporting to Pediatric NSQIP, utilization of laparoscopy has steadily increased and complication rates are lower than previously reported. These results offer benchmarks for quality improvement initiatives, and consideration of referral of this procedure to facilities with dedicated pediatric surgical support.

McLean<sup>1</sup>, A. Akinkuotu<sup>1</sup>, M. Phillips<sup>1</sup>, A. Hayes<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill, Pediatric Surgery, Chapel Hill, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Central line placement in children is common and can be associated with central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSIs). We hypothesize that identification of pre-operative risk factors associated with line site and selection may decrease CLABSI morbidity.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

Single institution case-control study using retrospective review of hospital epidemiologic data for pediatric cases (&le;18 years old) admitted between 1/1/2015 and 12/31/2019 with a CLABSI. Hospital data were then utilized to identify gender and age matched controls undergoing central line placement in a 2:1 ratio. Demographic and clinical factors were examined using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

During the study period, we identified 233 total patients (84 CLABSI, 149 without). There were 22, 55, 31, and 125 patients who underwent port, tunneled central venous line (CVL), non-tunneled CVL, and PICC placement respectively. When controlling for pertinent covariates, we found patients undergoing tunneled CVL had higher odds of CLABSI than those undergoing PICC (OR 2.48, CI 1.11, 5.56), patients undergoing port placement had decreased odds of CLABSI compared to PICC (OR 0.11, CI 0.01, 0.48), black children had higher odds of CLABSI than other races (OR 2.10, CI 1.06, 4.18), and there were lower odds of CLABSI when lines were placed for IV medications compared to those placed for solid tumor malignancy (See Table 1). No other clinical or demographic factors were associated with an increased odds of CLABSI.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

In this study, we found decreased odds of CLABSI in children requiring line placement for medication administration compared to those with solid tumor malignancy and a decreased odds of CLABSI in patients with a port. These findings are consistent with the published literature and supporting the generalizability of matching approach. Additionally, these data demonstrate increased odds of CLABSI with tunneled CVL compared to other lines. These data suggest utilization of PICC line instead of tunneled line placement, where possible. Patients also may benefit from temporary PICC line placement for initiation of immune suppressive therapy and transition to a tunneled line later in their treatment course. We noted an increased odds of CLABSI in black children compared to children of other races, highlighting another area of racial disparity in healthcare. The mechanisms and approaches to increase equity in CVL placement demands further evaluation.

Existing literature does not include data to guide optimal timing of US or MRI screening or when screening is no longer beneficial, and this screening is often forgotten. Detethering procedure has a high rate of neurological, urological, and pain improvement in patients with TCS. This procedure is often performed prophylactically due to concerns of lifelong incontinence. The goal of this study was to identify the number of EA/TEF patients who received spinal US/MRI and compare them to patients who did not receive the screening or received it later in life. This case series aims to improve screening procedure for infants with VACTERL syndrome.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective chart review was done of all patients treated at our institution for EA/TEF between January 1, 2013 &ndash; January 1, 2019 (n=79). Clinically significant spinal anomalies were defined as those that either required additional follow-up or surgical intervention. We examined the frequency with which patients were screened, how often an US, MRI or both were performed, how often a clinically significant spinal anomaly was identified and whether it was detected by US, MRI or both. We also looked at complication and infection rates for patients who had detethering procedures.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Screening for TCS was performed with MRI 59.5% of the time and US 16.5% of the time. However, 36.7% of patients did not undergo any screening, despite getting a referral. Of patients who did receive US (n=13), 10 patients also received MRI later in life. Of those patients, 5 of them who had a reported &ldquo;normal&rdquo; US demonstrated an &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; MRI later in life, 3 of whom received a neurosurgical intervention. The breakdown of screening for these patients can be seen in Figure 1. 46.8% of patients who received an MRI for screening demonstrated an anomaly, 63.6% of whom went on to receive neurosurgical intervention, typically in the form of a detethering procedure. Infection rates and complications were also observed in patients with neurosurgical interventions with an infection/complication rate of 0/14 at our institution.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: MRI demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting anomalies compared to ultrasound, and abnormal MRIs were frequently addressed by neurosurgeons with recommendations for elective detethering. A third of children were missed for screening and this will require a process improvement. The pros and cons of surgical detethering need to be considered and future prospects of this study aim to assess the risk/benefit of detethering procedures for VACTERL infants on long-term clinical outcomes.

These lesions routinely require operative resection of the affected lobe, with surgeons debating the merits of open thoracotomy versus thoracoscopic surgery. The aim of this study is to compare 30-day surgical outcomes between thoracoscopic and conventional open surgery by querying a nationally validated and risk-adjusted pediatric database.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The American College of Surgeons&rsquo; (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) database was queried for patients who underwent CLM resection from 2013 to 2019. To compare outcomes, we devised a composite adverse event score including cardiac arrest, death, discharge to a location other than home, neurologic deficit, postoperative infection, reintubation, reoperation, thromboembolic event and/or readmission. A subgroup analysis stratified patients by American Society for Anesthesiologists (ASA) class.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In the 1586 patients who underwent pulmonary resections for CLM, the median age at surgery was 220 days [IQR 119,372.5] with a slight male predominance 875 (55.2%). Patients in the open (n=836) compared to the thoracoscopic group (n=750) were more likely to be oxygen dependent prior to surgery (15.4% vs. 2.4%; p&lt;0.001) and were more likely to require an intraoperative transfusion (12.5% vs. 3.6%; p&lt;0.001). Overall, composite adverse events were lower in the thoracoscopic group 14.1% compared to the open group 22.1% (p&lt;0.001). Patients in the thoracoscopic group were also significantly more likely to be discharged home (99.2% vs. 95.3%; p&lt;0.001) and had a shorter hospital stay 2 vs. 3.5%; p&lt;0.001). Compared to the thoracoscopic group, patients in the open surgery group were more likely to require oxygen support at the time of discharge or 30 days post-operation (49.5% vs. 11.9%; p&lt;0.001). Overall, the proportion of thoracoscopic procedures has steadily increased over time: 59/155(38.1%) in 2013 to 233/387(60.2%) in 2019 (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This large retrospective study demonstrates safety, regardless of approach. Open resections have a higher composite adverse event score, possibly driven by higher ASA class patients. Pediatric surgeons appear to be getting more comfortable with thoracoscopic techniques as evidenced by the increased proportion of the minimally invasive approach over time, even in higher ASA class patients. While there is no significant association of technique on short term (30 day) outcomes in healthy patients, if feasible, the thoracoscopic approach appears to be beneficial in the higher ASA class patients.

Patient satisfaction continues to be a high priority for healthcare systems and their physicians. Identifying trends in patient complaints may lead to improvement in the mistrust in healthcare seen among different populations. Therefore, we hypothesized that patient relation&rsquo;s concerns are multifactorial with a large portion consisting of language barriers and other communication-related issues.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A review of all patient relations communications was performed at a large children&rsquo;s hospital from 2015-2020. As protective health information was involved, institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained. Each communication report was initially classified by hospital service and nature of concern. Reports classified under pediatric surgery were included, while other services such as plastic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and neurosurgery were excluded. Additional data identified for each report included basic demographics, insurance status, language, zip code, and hospital location. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
During this 5-year period, a total of 244 patient relations reports were generated for the Department of Surgery. The pediatric surgery team was involved in 146 reports, which were included in the review. Over half of the complaints dealt with acute appendicitis, elective surgery, or abscess drainage (54.1%). Majority were White patients with only 28% being Black, Asian, or Hispanic, combined. Forty-one percent of the reports were classified as communication issues while in the hospital. However, only ten complaints were due to language barriers (6.8%). Lastly, there was an even distribution of patients with private or government insurance policies.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Communication issues were the largest percentage of patient relations reports; however, language barrier complaints were minimal. Cultural bias likely emphasized language barriers as a larger than they truly are. In addition, non-White families were found to file less complaints than White counterparts. Communication for all patients is needed to ensure better patient satisfaction, patient engagement, and potentially better outcomes.

Parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis (PNAC) is a common morbidity in neonates requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Previous studies in infants with intestinal failure have shown a benefit of SMOF-lipid in reducing PNAC. It is not known whether this benefit extends to a general NICU population where SMOF-lipid is used on a selective basis. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of the introduction of SMOF-lipid to the PNAC rate in the general NICU setting.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
This is a retrospective review of NICU patients who received TPN for 7 or more days. We compared patients born between 1/1/2014-12/31/2015 (pre-SMOF) to patients born between 1/1/2017-12/31/2018 (post-SMOF). In the post-SMOF era, patients were given SMOF if their direct bilirubin was &ge;2, if they were anticipated to require prolonged TPN, or at the clinical discretion of the neonatologist. Descriptive statistics, demographics, rates of PNAC (direct bilirubin &ge;2), mortality, PNAC at hospital discharge, presence of surgical condition and days on TPN were examined. Fisher&rsquo;s exact test and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to compare the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 298 pre-SMOF patients and 301 post-SMOF patients. Demographics were similar between the two groups overall, but patients receiving SMOF lipid and surgical patients were older and larger than the overall groups (Table 1). Mortality was similar (6.7% pre-SMOF vs 5.6% post-SMOF). There was no difference in PNAC rate between the pre-SMOF and post-SMOF patient cohorts (Table 1). Among patients receiving SMOF-lipid (n=38), 58% had PNAC, and 13% had PNAC at hospital discharge. This was significantly higher than the post-SMOF population not receiving SMOF-lipid (n=263, 6% had PNAC, with 3% having PNAC at hospital discharge; p&lt;0.01). Among patients with a surgical condition (n=94), 28% had PNAC (29% pre-SMOF, 27% post-SMOF, p=0.82), and 11% had PNAC at discharge (13% pre-SMOF, 8% post-SMOF, p=0.7). However, PNAC rates in the subset of surgical patients who received SMOF-lipid in the post-SMOF era (n=23) was 43% (p&lt;0.01 compared to patients not getting SMOF-lipid in the post-SMOF era). Cholestasis rate at discharge in this group was 8.7% (p=0.65 compared to patients not getting SMOF-lipid).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
There were no significant differences in PNAC rates between the pre-SMOF and post-SMOF cohorts. However, the SMOF lipid was able to reduce PNAC at discharge in surgical patients to levels equivalent to those seen in neonates receiving TPN for 7 or more days, despite having a higher starting rate of PNAC. Further studies are needed to determine whether the general NICU population may benefit from SMOF lipid, or certain selective sub-populations.

However, few studies have sought to determine differences in preoperative evaluation in pinworm positive patients. Our hypothesis is that pediatric patients with post-operative appendiceal pathology showing Enterobius infection are possibly distinguishable from patients with acute appendicitis using history, laboratory, and imaging findings.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent appendectomy for presumed acute appendicitis during 2015 at our institution was performed. Patients with surgical pathology positive for Enterobius were matched with case controls based on age, sex, and BMI percentile. Data collection included: presenting symptoms, pediatric appendicitis score, physical exam findings, laboratory values, pre-operative imaging findings and final pathology.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 1153 appendectomies performed, 13 had pinworms on final pathology. When matched with case controls in 1:2 fashion, Enterobius positive patients were more likely to present with fever (p &lt; .05), and less likely to have RLQ rebound tenderness (p&lt; .005). Enterobiasis patients more often required further imaging due to equivocal initial ultrasound (p &lt; 0.05). Average appendix diameter differed between the two groups, with true appendicitis having a larger diameter when all imaging studies were compared. On ultrasound alone, the average size of Enterobiasis appendix and true appendicitis differed significantly (7.6mm vs 9.6 mm; p &lt; .05). On final pathology, Enterobiasis patients had more inflammation limited to the mucosa (p &lt;.005). All patients diagnosed with Enterobiasis post-operatively received appropriate treatment.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our data aligns with other studies demonstrating the presence of inflammation limited to the appendiceal mucosa caused by pinworm infection. These patients present with symptoms and imaging results differing from &ldquo;typical&rdquo; appendicitis, with less impressive physical exams, smaller size of the appendix on US and equivocal reporting of US that can lead to CT scan. It is unclear whether these patients could be treated for their infection and avoid appendectomy, and this warrants further study.

Perforated appendicitis in children is common and associated with significant morbidity. Since 2010, several studies have demonstrated that early appendectomy is associated with improved outcomes compared with initial nonoperative management and interval appendectomy. Despite these data, the uptake of this evidence-based practice remains unclear. This study aims to assess the trend in evidence-based early operative management for perforated appendicitis patients at a single center. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective cohort study of children &le; 18 years of age with acute appendicitis was conducted spanning 1/1/2010 through 12/31/2020 at a single U.S. children&rsquo;s hospital. Patients were identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, and manual chart review was performed. Patients were stratified, based upon the diagnosis of perforation in the preoperative setting, into 3 separate categories: 1) not perforated 2) suspicious for perforation 3) perforated. Our main outcome was the use of early operative management. We excluded patients who were immunosuppressed at diagnosis, treated at an outside hospital, or initially managed for an alternate pathology. Annual rates of early operative intervention and temporal trends were analyzed using a univariate logistic regression where year of admission served as a continuous variable. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
We identified 3679 patients diagnosed with appendicitis at our institution within the study period of which 91 were excluded and 3603 underwent analysis. Of the analysis cohort, 2159 (60.1%) were male, the average age at diagnosis was 9.8 years (SD 3.8 years), and 2113 (58.8%) were Hispanic white. The average number of patients was 326.4 patients per year (SD 62.4 patients). There were 2985 (83.2%) non-perforated patients with an average of 271.4 (SD 43.7 patients) per year and 240 (6.7%) patients with suspected perforation with an average of 21.8 (SD 11.8 patients) patients per year. Of the 365 (10.2%) perforated patients, the average number of patients per year was 33.2 (SD 3.1 patients). Annual rates of early operative management ranged from 33.3% to 84.8%. The annual rate of early operative management was 43.4% in 2010 and 80.3% in 2020 with an overall upward (OR = 1.2, CI [1.11 &ndash; 1.28], p &lt; 0.01) (Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Early operative management in perforated appendicitis has slowly increased between 2010 and 2020 indicating the uptake of evidence-based practice. Drivers to implement and accelerate adoption of evidence-based practices such as institution of clinical practice guidelines warrant future investigation.

Opioid consumption in neonatal patients has been shown to increase the predisposition towards an opioid use disorder as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders. Regional anesthesia provides a means to help reduce opioid consumption during post-operative pain management. We aimed to study the current practices and safety of regional anesthesia usage in post-operative pain management for neonates at our institution, hypothesizing that certain patient characteristics increase the likelihood of nerve block administration. 
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A retrospective study was conducted of neonatal (age&lt;1 year) general surgery patients undergoing procedures at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital from January 2019 to December 2021. Patients were included if they were administered regional anesthesia at the time of their procedure. Patients who received local infiltrates of anesthetics but no regional blocks were excluded. Patient demographics, operative details, regional anesthesia administration, and complications within 90 post-operative days were extracted from the electronic medical record. Descriptive analysis was performed.
<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Of the 704 patients who underwent surgery, 76 (11%) were administered regional anesthesia. Forty-nine (64%) patients were male. The median age and weight at surgery were 3.53 months (1.11, 6.02) and 4.74 kg (3.26, 6.16), respectively. Regional anesthesia was administered to 22 (29%) patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repairs, 19 (25%) exploratory laparotomies, 13 (17%) laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs, 2 (3%) gastrostomy tube placements, and 20 (26%) other procedures. Ropivacaine was the regional anesthetic of choice for all patients, 13 (17%) of which also received a clonidine adjuvant. Various types of blocks were administered (Figure). One (1%) patient underwent reoperation and 8 (11%) were seen post-operatively for complications. Of the 76 patients, there were no complications related to the administration of regional anesthesia.
<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study showed that regional anesthesia is a safe intervention in neonatal surgery, encompassing applications for caudal, thoracic, lumbar to thoracic, and quadratus lumborum blocks. Regional anesthesia was most frequently administered in neonates undergoing inguinal hernia repairs as well as exploratory laparotomies. Further research is needed to understand the efficacy of neonatal regional anesthesia in reducing opioid consumption.

Understanding of the pre-operative process is essential, and our institution has previously shown how to include parents during the pre-induction surgical safety checklist (PSSC). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of our institution&rsquo;s pre-operative education in preparing parents for their child&rsquo;s surgery, evaluate if this education was adequate, and understand if these approaches gave parents the confidence to voice concerns about their child&rsquo;s care.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A convenience sampling of parents and guardians of patients (age&lt;18 years) receiving elective operations was conducted at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital from May 2021- July 2021. All pediatric subspecialties were included. The survey was administered to parents in the waiting area in both English and Spanish. Developed by the research team, the survey used ethnographic characteristics and included statements about preparedness, pre-operative education, and inclusion in the PSSC. Answers were analyzed using a 5-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistics was performed. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of the 137 caregivers, 127(93%) agreed to take the survey. Incomplete surveys were excluded, leaving 116 included for analysis. The mean patient age was 8&plusmn;11.9 years(Table). Twenty(17.2%) surveys were completed in Spanish. The most common surgery subspecialty was general surgery(26%). The majority of patients underwent outpatient surgery(78%), and of these, 20% of guardians did not feel prepared for surgery. Forty-two(48%) parents whose child had surgery for the first time answered they felt unprepared, despite our institution&rsquo;s pre-operative education process. Twenty-six(23%) of those that felt comfortable voicing their concerns had a four-year university degree. Thirty percent of parents stated they did not feel they received the appropriate information about their child&rsquo;s outpatient procedure. Out of the 20 Spanish-speaking parents, only 3(15%) felt they received adequate information about their child&rsquo;s surgery, and 95% would voice concerns on behalf of their child if necessary.

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Parent involvement in pediatric pre-operative care continues to be important for patient safety. This study showed significant deficits in preparedness and education provided to parents prior to their child&rsquo;s surgery despite purposeful, targeted measures in pre-operative education. Further exploration of potential healthcare delivery disparities, including amongst Spanish-speaking parents, should occur to ensure an equitable pre-operative experience for all pediatric patients.

Elkbuli<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>FIU, Miami, FL, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Kendall Regional Medical Center, Department Of Surgery, Division Of Trauma And Surgical Critical Care, Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: There is a lack of literature regarding the most effective timing to initiate physical therapy (PT) among traumatically injured patients. We aim to evaluate the impact of early PT/mobilization protocols versus delayed or late PT/mobilization protocols on clinical outcomes of trauma patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective cohort analysis of an urban level-1 trauma center from 2014-2019 was performed. Univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression were performed with significance defined as p&lt;0.05.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 11,937 patients were analyzed. Among patients without a traumatic brain injury (TBI), late PT initiation times were associated with 60% lower odds of being discharged home without services (p&lt;0.05), significantly increased hospital and ICU length of stay (H-LOS, ICU-LOS) (p&lt;0.05), and significantly higher odds of complications (VTE, pneumonia, pressure ulcers, ARDS) (p&lt;0.001). Among patients with a TBI, late PT initiation time had over 60% lower odds of being discharged home without services (p&lt;0.05) and significantly longer H-LOS and ICU-LOS (p&lt;0.05) however did not experience significantly higher odds of complications (p&gt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Among traumatically injured patients, early PT is associated with decreased odds of complications, shorter H-LOS and ICU-LOS, and a favorable discharge disposition to home without services. Adoption of early PT initiation/mobilization protocols and establishment of prophylactic measures against complications associated with delayed PT is critical to maximize quality of care and trauma patient outcomes. Multi-center prospective studies are needed to ascertain the impact of PT initiation times in greater detail and to minimize trauma patient morbidity.

Samra<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport, Department Of Surgery, Shreveport, LA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>LSU Health Science Center - Shreveport, School Of Medicine, Shreveport, LA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Trauma recidivism is prevalent with rates previously noted to be as high as 44%. Recidivism has been associated with increased patient morbidity, mortality, and excess healthcare resource utilization. Several risk factors for recidivism have been identified however no risk stratification tool has been developed. Our primary objective was to characterize our trauma population and identify unique risk factors for recidivism to better identify those at increased risk in the future. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All trauma patients 18 years and older presenting to an urban level I trauma center over a 5-year period were considered for inclusion into the study. Patients who presented with traumatic injury on two or more separate occasions were identified as recidivist. Encounters for patients presenting with complications or sequela of a previous trauma admission were excluded from data analysis. Patients were identified and data was collected using an institutional trauma registry. Patients were characterized by age, gender, and race. Information on mechanism of injury (penetrating versus blunt), injury severity scores, and whether mortality occurred during admission were also recorded. The patient&rsquo;s zip code of primary residence was also recorded to estimate socioeconomic status by converting zip codes to median household income using most recent Census Bureau data. Chi squared analysis was used to analyze categorical data, one-sample t-test was used for continuous variables.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 11,210 patients were included in data analysis. Of these patients, 273 were identified as trauma recidivist accounting for 556 trauma encounters. The overall recidivism rate was 2.54% and median time to recidivism was 1.4 years. When comparing recidivists to non-recidivists, recidivists had larger proportion of men (p &lt; 0.05), African Americans (p &lt; 0.05), and encounters for penetrating trauma (p &lt; 0.001). No significant difference in mortality were noted between the two groups. However, when looking at all trauma encounters in which mortality occurred, these patients were statistically more likely to be male (p = 0.05), African American (p &lt; 0.05), and occur following penetrating trauma (p &lt;0.0001). Recidivists were also more likely to have primary residence in zip codes with significantly lower median household income levels when compared to non-recidivist (p &lt; 0.000003). A large correlation between low median household income and patients presenting following penetrating trauma was also identified (p = 4.5x10<sup>-26</sup>).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Trauma recidivism is a major medical and social issue which appears to affect males, African Americans, and patients from poorer neighborhoods disproportionately. By identifying these patients and neighborhoods most affected by recidivism in our area, we can more efficiently allocate our resources to better target these most vulnerable patients with hopes of reducing rates of recidivism in the future.

Differences in trauma outcomes based on gender remain unproven. We sought to investigate the association of gender with outcomes among geriatric patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) by performing a meta-analysis and review of the literature. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An electronic search of PubMed was conducted for articles on outcomes of geriatric patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) published between 01/01/2012 to 07/31/2021. A total of 363 articles were identified, from these, 74 articles met the inclusion criteria of isolated TBI in geriatric patients. Upon review of the articles, only 5 met the specified criteria of the search which described male and female mortality amongst geriatric patients suffering isolated TBI. The data from these papers were combined into a master file and meta-analysis was performed using random effect model with RevMan 5.4 software. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The total number of patients in these 5 papers was 23,893, of these 11,971 were men and 11,922 were women. The Odds Ratio of mortality in these papers were 1.40, 2.40, 1.20, 1.28 and 1.15 with a combined final Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.28, a p value of less than 0.00001 and 95% CI of 1.21-1.36.

Kopatsis<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>NYC Health +Hospitals/ Elmhurst, Surgery, Queens, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is one of the factors increasing mortality of patients who had traumatic intra-abdominal bleeding and underwent emergent liver repair. This study aims to investigate incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of patients who had emergent liver repair for traumatic intraabdominal bleeding.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Multivariate analysis was used to investigate predictors and outcomes of patients who had emergent liver repair and underwent DIC using NIS database during 2009 to 2014.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 5,063 patients who underwent emergent liver repair for traumatic intra-abdominal bleeding during the period of 2009-2014 were identified. Among which, 78(1.5%) developed DIC. Patients who had DIC had significantly higher mortality (53.8% vs. 9.3%, P&lt;0.01). Patients who had Acid/Base or electrolyte disorders (AOR: 3.02, P&lt;0.01) had a significantly higher risk of DIC. Patients who had pRBC transfusion (AOR: 1.81, P&lt;0.01), platelets transfusion (AOR; 3.91, P=0.02), and coagulation factors transfusion (AOR; 6.90, P&lt;0.01) had a significant risk of DIC. Transfusion of blood expander was not associated with an increase in risk of DIC (P=0.98). The number of the procedures during the operation was significantly associated with development of DIC (AOR: 4.58, P&lt;0.01). Patients who survived DIC had a mean hospitalization length of 20 days.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although DIC following liver repair for traumatic intra-abdominal bleeding is not common (1.5%), it is associated with high mortality (53%) and a prolonged hospitalization if the patient survives DIC. Transfusion of blood or blood
products, Acid/Base abnormalities, and number of the procedures during the emergent operation are associated with development of DIC. Trauma centers may consider protocols which can decrease the risk of post-operative DIC by identifying
correctable risk factors.

Prolonged cervical collar utilization has been shown to lengthen hospital stay, increase complications and cost. A Cervical Collar Clearance protocol (CCC) utilizing CT was implemented to decrease MRI usage and shorten hospital length of stay.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A pre/post CCC protocol analysis of prospectively collected data at an urban Level I trauma center between 2016 and 2020 was performed. Adult (&gt;18 years) blunt trauma patients with a cervical collar were included. Patients unable to be cleared clinically underwent CT of the cervical spine, if abnormal or neurological deficits were present, an MRI was performed. Imaging utilization, diagnostic yield (defined as rate of abnormal findings), missed injuries, hospital length of stay (LOS) and hospital charges were compared between the two groups.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

A total of 9,682 patients were identified; 21.7% were not cleared clinically (post-CCC: 1,053; pre-CCC: 1,050). Groups did not differ in ISS (9 [4-14] vs. 9 [5-14]; p=0.126) or GCS (15 [15-15] vs. 15 [15-15]; p=0.117). The post-CCC group had significantly higher CT utilization (86.3% vs. 66.9%; p&lt; 0.001) and lower diagnostic yield (10.8% vs. 16.0%; p&lt; 0.001). In those with CT, MRI utilization (11.3% vs. 11.4%; p=0.968) and diagnostic yield (35.9% vs. 28.8%; p=0.305) were not different. The post-CCC group had no missed injuries and hospital LOS was significantly shorter (1.9 [0.9-4.6] days vs. 2.3 [1.0-5.2] days; p&lt; 0.001). Hospital charges ($52K [36-111] vs. $53K [34-121]; p=0.445) were similar. On regression analysis, CCC implementation was associated with decreased hospital LOS (&beta;=-0.462; p=0.039), but not with less hospital charges. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Implementation of a Cervical Collar Clearance protocol resulted in 100% specificity and sensitivity in detecting cervical spine injuries and decreased hospital length of stay. Despite increased CT utilization, there was no difference in hospital charges.

Siegel<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Orthopedics, Birmingham, AL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Knee arthrodesis (KA) is a procedure in which the knee joint is fused between the tibia and femur. In most cases, KA is performed in order to salvage the lower limb and avoid above the knee amputation (AKA). Two common indications for knee arthrodesis are traumatic injury and recurrent infection of a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). An assumption of this study is that patients with infected TKA&rsquo;s will be older, while those with traumatic injury will be younger. In addition, we presume that older patients with infected TKA&rsquo;s will have less baseline lower limb functionality pre-operatively as compared to those with traumatic injury. Factors that will affect the outcome from KA include post-operative lower limb functionality and longevity of the KA. We hypothesize that older patients will have a greater amount of infected TKAs and better outcomes from KA due to a lower expectation of lower limb functionality and less longevity required from the KA. To our knowledge no current literature has addressed the outcomes of KA in regard to patient age and represents a novel idea regarding advocacy for KA in an elderly patient population. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
An IRB protocol was established and approved for this retrospective analysis. A retrospective chart review was then conducted on 49 patients who underwent KA at our institution from 2005 to 2020. Patients from the cohort were separated by age into a cohort of young and old. The cohort was then contacted by telephone and asked to answer a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) assessment for pain and a qualitative assessment of patient satisfaction. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
There were 27 patients in the old category and 22 patients in the young category. In the old cohort, 75% had a septic TKA, 37% required revision surgery, and only 3% had a revision AKA. In the young cohort, 60% had a traumatic injury, 48% required revision surgery, and 24% required a revision AKA. The old cohort had an average VAS of 2 and 88% chose a KA over an AKA. The young cohort had an average VAS of 8 and only 15% chose KA over an AKA.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
This study showed a greater amount of infected TKA&rsquo;s present in the old patient cohort and greater traumatic injury in the young cohort. In addition, fewer revision surgeries and far less revision AKA&rsquo;s were performed on the old patient cohort. The overall patient satisfaction was greater and pain was less among the old patient population. Therefore, this investigation has supported the hypothesis that older age is associated with better outcomes from KA. Due to the frequency of failed TKA among the elderly patient population, the KA should be considered as a viable and preferred method of treatment for these patients.

Sutherland<sup>1</sup>, H. Horng<sup>1</sup>, N. Glass<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Rutgers New Jersey Medical School/University Hospital, Newark, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Thromboelastography (TEG) is a hemostatic assay which measures the dynamics of clot development in real time. TEG has been previously demonstrated to decrease the overall usage of blood products, decrease hospital length of stay, and improve mortality when used to guide transfusion of blood products in patients. We analyzed the utilization of thromboelastography at a single level 1 trauma center. We sought to determine which services most commonly ordered TEG and if TEG was used appropriately to guide transfusion practices.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients underwent TEG during May 2021. This was done at a large, urban level 1 trauma center. The list of completed TEGs was provided by the facility&#39;s lab that is in charge of running the test. We then performed a chart review on the patients to assess patient demographics, conventional coagulation profiles, transfusion practices around the time of the assessment, and service ordering the test.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were a total of 87 TEGs run on a total of 31 patients over the study period analyzed. The results indicated that 60% of patients who had a high R time (&gt;10 minutes) received FFP, however 42% of patients who did not have a high R time still received FFP. 46% of patients with low MA received platelets, whereas 18% of patients with normal MA (50-70) also received platelets. Finally, 63% of patients with a low alpha angle received cryoprecipitate, versus 14% of patients with normal values (53-72). The most common specialty that ordered TEG was internal medicine (74%), with hepatology being the majority within that specialty (27.6%), followed by surgery (17%) and anesthesiology (9%). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Thromboelastography is indicated for use in surgery, specifically trauma and transplant surgery, as targeted deficient component transfusion in bleeding patients. The results of this study show that a Level 1 trauma center is not using the most accurate test to guide their transfusion protocols as surgery and anesthesiology combined only make up 26% of the usage of this test. Internal medicine, however, may be overordering this tests for patients it may not be indicated for. More research and education needs to be done with regards to the sub-specialty usage of this test, why it is and isn&rsquo;t being used, what barriers there may be to the timely use of this information and when it is best indicated for usage.

Bonne<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Rutgers, NJ Medical School, Department Of Surgery, Division Of Trauma And Surgical Critical Care, Newark, NJ, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Rutgers, Graduate School Of Biomedical Sciences, Newark, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Firearm violence is the second leading cause of injuries and injury-related deaths among children in the United States, surpassed only by automobile injuries (Azrael, et al, 2015; Fowler, et al, 2017). Younger children are more likely to be injured or killed by a firearm in the home as a result of intimate partner-related violence or being unintentionally shot by someone else. Existing research provides little information linking firearm violence against children with mistreatment of them. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This retrospective review of pediatric trauma at a single Level I trauma center evaluates the demographics, environmental factors, and social circumstances surrounding firearm violence against children, ages 0-21 years (2014-2020). Through review of electronic Trauma History and Physical, social work notes, nutritional assessments, and discharge summaries, we examined patient demographics, intent, type of weapon, perpetrator, location gunshot wound was sustained, mortality, and whether abuse or neglect was suspected. We examined trends using descriptive statistics on outcomes variables. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 348 patients enrolled in the study, the age ranged from 4 to 22 years of age, with mean of 18 years (SD 2.6 years); 91% of patients were male, with female slightly younger than male victims (17 years, SD 3.5, 18 years, SD 2.5, p &lt;0.05). Racial identity comprised of 85% Black, and ethnicity 89% non-Hispanic. There was an 87% increase in pediatric GSWs between 2015 and 2016, an eleven-fold increase in 2017 compared to 2014. Majority of patients sustained 1-2 GSWs (68%), most of the GSWs took place on the street (37%), and 10% within vicinity of the home. Average length of stay was 4 days, with no statistical difference based on gender (female 4d, SD 5d, male 4d, SD 8d, p &gt; 0.05). GSW intent was classified as assault in about half of the cases (51%). Only one of the 8 patients with self-inflicted GSWs was done so with intent to harm. 9% of all pediatric GSWs resulted in fatal injuries, 19% due to assault and 6% unintentional, with no significant gender predominance. Social workers identified child abuse in 1% (n=4) and neglect in 3% (n=9) of patients; however, of the 21 patients with multiple GSW encounters, three were evaluated by social work, and one presumed to experience neglect. Nutritional assessment identified 29% of patients to be nourished.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Firearm injuries and fatalities are at an increased amongst the urban pediatric population, comprising mostly of Black, non-Hispanic males, which has sustained in the latter half of the past decade. While most injuries were attributed to assault, this intent was identified in only 19% of firearm fatalities. There remains a paucity of assessment of environmental and social health, however early or outpatient evaluation for abuse and neglect in the home remains critical.

One in three motor vehicle crash (MVC) related deaths involve intoxicated drivers. Understanding risk patterns associated with intoxicated patients in MVCs can inform providers of most common injuries and provide insight into patient outcomes. We hypothesized that alcohol use has protective effects on intoxicated trauma patients in MVCs, with lower mortality, morbidity, and disability rates than sober patients do.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective review of the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study (PTOS) database from 1/2003-1/2018 for trauma patients &ge; 21 years admitted to Pennsylvania (PA) trauma centers after an MVC. Patients were grouped as intoxicated or sober by blood alcohol content defined by PA law.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

A total of 77,803 patients met inclusion criteria; 24,465 (31.4%) of patients were intoxicated and 53,338 (68.6%) sober. Intoxicated patients were more likely to be male (76.9% vs 59.8%, p &lt; 0.001), younger (mean age in years: 37 vs 49, p &lt; 0.001), and Hispanic (5.2% vs 3.8%, p &lt; 0.001).

Intoxicated patients were intubated twice as often (15% vs 6.9%, p &lt; 0.001) and more likely to have positive urine drug screens for cocaine (7.1% vs 3.2%, p &lt; 0.001), benzodiazepines (12.7% vs 9.9%, p &lt; 0.001), and THC (11.7% vs 5.8%, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, intoxicated patients had a higher ISS (15 vs 14, p &lt; 0.001) and were more likely to have severe injuries defined as AIS &ge; 3 to the head, face, neck, abdomen, and spine (Figure 1).

Lastly, intoxicated patients were more often discharged to home (70.1% vs 63.4%, p &lt; 0.001) and had lower mortality rates [AOR .68; p &lt; 0.001].


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Despite higher rates of intubation, greater ISS and AIS scores, intoxicated patients were more likely to be discharged home. Intoxicated patients also had a lower mortality rate than non-intoxicated patients.

Additionally, mortality for failure of nonoperative management (NOM) of high grade liver injury (HGLI) is 21% (NTDB). We hypothesize our mature, trauma-hepatobiliary-transplant collaborative approach improves outcomes in HGLI in both early operative management (OM) and failed NOM.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective review of adult patients (age &gt;18) with HGLI (AAST IV-V) admitted to our trauma center from January 2010 to July 2020. Demographic data, mechanism of injury (MOI), ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, operative or IR intervention, morbidity, and mortality were abstracted from the electronic medical records. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared independently by management strategy (OM vs. NOM) and injury grade using univariate statistics with a p-value &lt;0.05 considered significant. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 108 patients with HGLI were identified; 89 (82%) sustained blunt trauma with a median ISS of 33 (26, 38). There were no differences in age or ISS between groups (p&gt;0.05, Table 1). There were 70 grade IV (65%) and 38 grade V (35%) injuries. 58 patients (54%) underwent OM, 50 (46%) underwent initial NOM. Of 7 (14.0%) who failed NOM, 6 were grade V. OM mortality was 12 (21%): 5 (42%) required ED thoracotomy first, 3 (25%) had multiple organ failure after liver resection, and 4 (33%) had severe TBI. No mortality occurred in the NOM group, including the 7 failures requiring operation (p&lt;0.001). Grade V injuries underwent more frequent OM and experienced a higher NOM failure rate (p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our institutional model for management of HGLI has been a collaboration of trauma-hepatobiliary-transplant surgery for three decades. This multidisciplinary approach resulted in improved outcomes in patients with high grade liver injury.

The aim of our study was to compare outcomes of adult severe TBI patients who underwent ECMO versus those who did not undergo ECMO.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A 3-year (2015-2017) retrospective analysis of the ACS-TQIP was performed. All adult (&ge;18 years) trauma patients with severe TBI (Head AIS &ge;3) who underwent at least one day of mechanical ventilation were included. Patients were stratified into those who received ECMO (ECMO group) and those who did not (Non-ECMO group). Propensity score matching (1:2) was performed, accounting for patient demographics, comorbidities, injury parameters including pattern of intracranial injuries, operative interventions including craniotomy, number of days on ventilator, in-hospital thromboprophylaxis, transfusion requirements, and ACS trauma center verification level. Outcome measures were in-hospital major complications, unplanned return to OR, adverse discharge disposition, and in-hospital mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A matched cohort of 369 patients (ECMO, 123; Non-ECMO, 246) was analyzed. Overall, mean age was 35&plusmn;15 years, 91% of patients were male, median Head AIS was 3[3-4], median Chest AIS was 3[2-4], and median ISS was 34[25-41]. Three percent of patients underwent craniectomy/craniotomy, 77% received thromboprophylaxis, and median number of days on ventilator was 12[3-24]. The two groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics. The ECMO group had higher rates of sepsis (14% vs. 6%; p&lt;0.01), pulmonary embolism (13% vs. 3%; p&lt;0.01), acute kidney injury (26% vs. 13%; p&lt;0.01), cardiac arrest (23% vs. 13%; p=0.02), and mortality (47% vs. 22%; p&lt;0.01), and similar rates of adverse discharge disposition (40% vs. 50%; p=0.06), and unplanned return to OR (4.1% vs. 4.5%, p=0.84) compared to the Non-ECMO group.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Severe TBI patients who undergo ECMO have an increased likelihood of death and major complications, compared to similarly injured and ventilated patients who do not undergo ECMO. Further prospective studies are warranted to study the safety of ECMO use in TBI patients and to identify the subclass of patients who would most benefit from receiving ECMO.

The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of adult blunt abdominal solid organ injury patients who received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to those who received unfractionated heparin (UFH).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a one-year (2017) retrospective analysis of the ACS TQIP database. Adult (&ge;18 years) blunt trauma patients who sustained at least one abdominal solid organ injury (liver, kidney, or spleen AIS&ge;1) and received either LMWH or UFH during their stay were included. Patients who were transferred, or had other body regions AIS&gt;3, or renal failure were excluded. Patients were stratified into those who received LMWH versus those who received UFH. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed. Patients were matched for demographics, vital signs, injury parameters, comorbidities, transfusion requirements, operative interventions, and trauma center verification level. Outcome measures were thromboembolic complications, hospital and ICU lengths of stay (LOS), and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A matched cohort of 4,114 adult blunt abdominal solid organ injury patients who received thromboprophylaxis (LMWH, 2,057; UFH, 2,057) was analyzed. Overall, the mean age was 47&plusmn;19 years, 67% of patients were male, and 72% were white. Median ISS was 13 [9-17], median Abdomen AIS was 3 [2-3]. Compared to the UFH group, the LMWH group had lower rates of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (4.1% vs. 2.3%, p&lt;0.01) and pulmonary embolism (PE) (2.1% vs. 1.2%, p=0.04), shorter ICU LOS (4 [2-8] vs. 3 [1-7] days, p&lt;0.01), shorter hospital LOS (9 [5-17] vs. 8 [5-14] days, p&lt;0.01), and lower in-hospital mortality (4.8% vs. 2.8%, p&lt;0.01).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Trauma patients with blunt abdominal solid organ injuries who received LMWH as thromboprophylaxis during their hospital length of stay had fewer DVTs and PEs, shorter LOS, and improved survival. Clinicians may use these findings to guide decisions on thromboprophylaxis in this subset of trauma patients.

Racial disparities among adult trauma patients have been previously described in the literature. Similar information about geriatric TBI patients is lacking. The aim of this study is to assess whether race influences outcomes in geriatric TBI patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a 1-year (2017) analysis of the ACS-TQIP dataset. Geriatric (age&ge;65 years) TBI (Head AIS&ge;3) patients were included. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to control for patient demographics, insurance status, injury parameters, comorbidities, and vital signs, and verification level of trauma centers. Outcome measures were in-hospital complications, discharge disposition and mortality.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 48,327 geriatric TBI patients were analyzed. Among geriatric TBI patients, 45,239 were White and 2,998 were African American. Mean age was 78&plusmn;7 years, and 46% were females. The univariate analysis of outcomes is summarized in Table 1. On multivariate regression analysis, the African American race was associated with higher odds of in-hospital complications (OR,1.3;95%CI,1.2-1.5;p&lt;0.01). African American patients were more likely to be discharged to skilled nursing facility/rehabilitation facility (OR,1.2;95%CI,1.1-1.3;p&lt;0.01), and were less likely to be discharged home (OR,0.9;95%CI,0.84-0.99;p&lt;0.02) compared to White patients. No significant difference in in-hospital mortality was seen between the two groups (p=0.12).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results show that race influences outcomes of geriatric TBI patients. These disparities exist regardless of age, gender, injury severity, and insurance status. Further studies are needed to highlight disparities by racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors and to identify potentially modifiable risk factors in the geriatric trauma population.

Patients presenting with such injuries may undergo either open surgical repair or laparoscopic repair. The aim of our study was to compare the outcomes of open surgical approach and laparoscopy in trauma patients with isolated bladder and ureteral injury.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a 2017 review of ACS-TQIP and identified trauma patients with isolated bladder and ureteral injury who underwent open surgical repair or laparoscopy. A 1:1 propensity score matching was performed adjusting for demographics, vitals (ED SBP, HR, GCS), mechanism of injury, ISS, each body region AIS, and transfusion units.

We hypothesize that expediting direct admin to OR resuscitation time for specific mechanisms of injuries (MOIs), especially for motor vehicle accident (MVA) patients, will improve overall mortality.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective analysis of our trauma registry at a Level 1 Trauma center from 2016 to 2020 and examined time-segment data (maximum 24 hours) from ED arrival to death. All patients were included regardless of MOIs (penetrating and blunt). Multivariate logistic regression was performed and the results were presented as odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals, and p values (statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 738 patients met study criteria (mean age=35.7&plusmn;15.6 years with 84% males). Patients admitted for MVA had the highest overall mortality rate (37.5%, p&lt;0.001) and the longest ED-to-OR time (52&plusmn;20 minutes, p&lt;0.001) compared to those admitted for other MOIs (including both penetrating and blunt). The MVA cohort also experienced the shortest OR start-to-death time (109&plusmn;24 minutes, p=0.04) compared to other MOI cohorts. MVA multivariate analysis showed that patients with a longer direct admin to OR resuscitation had a higher risk of mortality (OR=1.03, 95%CI: 1.01-1.07, p=0.01) (Figure 1). Other significant variables found to be associated with mortality/survival included obesity (OR=3.24, 95%CI: 1.13-9.34, p=0.029) and hypotensive on arrival (OR=3.37, 95%CI: 1.50-7.59) (Figure 1).

Dumas<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Burn, Trauma, Acute Care Surgery/Surgery, Dallas, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Emergency Department Tube Thoracostomy (EDTT) is a common procedure with associated complications; however, the ability to assess procedural skills in-vivo is difficult. Trauma Video Review (TVR) allows for granular, objective data for performance improvement. We sought to describe procedural variability and complication rates of EDTT using TVR.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We reviewed 6-months of trauma EDTT videos. EDTTs placed without a video, with incomplete visualization, or in patients in extremis (CPR or resuscitative thoracotomies) were excluded. Patient characteristics including demographics, injury mechanism, severity, and hemodynamic instability (Class III/IV shock) were recorded. The primary outcome was a procedure score modified from the validated TUBE-iCOMP assessment tool. Scores consisted of 4 domains, each with individual subcategories (Table). Additional measures of performance included decision time and total time (the sum of the chest decompression time [time from decision to place chest tube to entry into chest cavity] and completion time [time from entry of chest cavity to completion of procedure]). Post procedure x-ray and chart review were utilized to review placement accuracy and procedural complications.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
25 chest tubes were reviewed. Patient characteristics included: age 29 [23-37], BMI 24.5 [21.7-31.1], injury severity score 21 [16-29], male (72%), blunt (52%). In 80% of cases, a junior resident (PGY1/2) performed the EDTT. The median composite procedure score was 9 [8-10]. The highest scoring subcategories were suturing the chest tube in place (96%), attaching the pleuravac (96%), and correct identification of landmarks/incision (96%). The lowest was appropriately prepping (52%). There was a significantly higher procedure score in stable patients (9 vs 7, P-value &lt;0.05). The mean total procedural time was 12.7 minutes [6.2-19.0]. This included a decision time of 5.8 minutes [3.1-11.2], chest decompression time of 6.5 minutes [3.4-11.7], and a securing time of 3.0 minutes [2.1-5.4]. Most frequently documented complications were malposition (32%), removal and replacement in the operating room (20%), and chest tube falling out (12%). On post-procedure x-ray, malpositioning included low rib entry in 50%, basilar tip location in 25%, tip location in the fissure in 5%, deep placement in 40%, shallow placement in 10%, and kinking in 40%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Utilizing TVR to objectively review EDTT, we found that a higher procedure score correlated with the stability of the patient. We also found notable variability in adequate procedural prepping (52%) and placement accuracy. These areas provide areas for targeted training for quality improvement in EDTT.

Trauma patients often require intubation with subsequent need for invasive monitoring with central venous catheters (CVC) or arterial lines (AL). Bundling line placement with intubation in trauma patients may be a safe and efficacious approach to reducing overall ICU complications, length of stay, and mortality. Currently, no studies address bundled procedures in intubated trauma patients. Identifying risk factors favoring this immediate bundled line (IBL) approach may provide a novel approach for preventing delay of care and improving outcomes in intubated trauma patients. We hypothesized that severely injured patients and those with hemodynamic instability may benefit from IBL.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We performed a retrospective review of all intubated trauma patients from 1/2015-12/2020 at a Level I Trauma Center. Patients less than 18 years of age or those who died or were transferred prior to intensive care unit (ICU) admission were excluded. Primary outcome was time from intubation to CVC and/or AL. Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) as well as overall mortality. The immediate period was defined as within 4 hours of intubation.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
726 patients were included in the study. A majority received a CVC and/or AL with 17.6% being placed in a delayed fashion. Almost half of the population (47.67%) had neither a central nor arterial line placed. IBL was less likely after a fall, but more likely with gunshot wound (GSW) or pedestrian struck (p&lt;0.001). Patients with severe head injury (AIS?3) more often had immediate AL or delayed bundled lines (p&lt;0.001). More than half (62.2%) of substance abuse patients had no lines (p&lt;0.001). IBL was more common with both massive transfusion protocol or with transfusion of any blood products (p&lt;0.001). Hypotensive patients were more likely to receive immediate CVC or IBL (p&lt;0.001). IBL was associated with a significantly lower GCS than other groups (p=0.019) and a higher mean ISS than the population (23 v. 17, p&lt;0.001). IBL had significantly shorter hospital LOS, but longer periods of intubation (p&lt;0.001). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that severe or profound ISS, GSW and pedestrian struck were predictive factors of IBL (Table 1). Severe head injury, designated by AIS?3 head or GCS 3-8, had decreased odds of IBL [AOR 0.307 (CI 0.156-0.605), p&lt;0.001] and [AOR 0.448 (CI .240-0.834), p=0.011], respectively).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Intubated trauma patients presenting with certain mechanisms (GSW, pedestrian struck), receiving blood transfusions or exhibiting severe/profound ISS may benefit from IBL at time of intubation.

The proper dosage of this drug and the efficacy of antifactor Xa (Anti-Xa) levels in improving prophylactic outcomes are not well described in this population. We hypothesize that drawing anti-Xa levels will not have a significant impact on VTE prevention.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective cohort of trauma patients between the years of 2014-2021 who were prescribed enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis were identified. Patients greater than eighteen years old were excluded. Multivariate logistic regression analyses as well as univariate analyses were performed.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Eighty-two patients were identified. Twenty-seven patients had an anti-Xa level drawn (32.9%). Median initial anti-Xa level was 0.22 IU/mL (IQR 0.16-0.33). Median initial dose was 0.5 mg/kg (IQR 0.43-0.59). Nineteen patients had their enoxaparin dose changed (23.2%); ten of which were due to an anti-Xa level (52.6%). Five patients ultimately developed VTE (6.1%). No association was found between anti-Xa levels being drawn and a VTE event (p=0.33). Similarly, no association was found between having a dose adjustment and a VTE event (p=0.71). There was also no association found between having a dose change (with or without anti-Xa levels), and VTE (p=0.08). Multivariate linear regression demonstrated that having an anti-Xa level drawn increased the odds of a dose adjustment by 13-fold (p=0.001). No obvious clinical factor such as severity of illness, admission location, GCS, or weight predicted dose change.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: VTE was an uncommon event this retrospective study. Use of anti-Xa levels did not seem to significantly impact prophylactic outcomes in this cohort. Physicians should take this into consideration as they manage VTE prophylaxis in this population.

Our aim was to evaluate the timeliness of urgent pelvic angiography comparing the hybrid OR to the interventional radiology (IR) department for critically injured patients. We hypothesize that the time to pelvic angiography would be equivalent in the hybrid OR compared to the IR department. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All patients with pelvic fractures in a single level 1 trauma center from March 2013 to May 2021 were identified. We included only patients arriving in the emergency department (ED) who underwent trauma team activation and required transfer directly to OR or IR and received urgent pelvic angiography. Primary outcome was time to initiation of pelvic angiography from arrival to ED. This was determined by the time difference from ED arrival to the first fluoroscopic image recorded. Secondary outcome was total angiography time and in-hospital mortality. Univariable analysis was performed with a p value of &lt;0.05 being statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 581 patients with pelvic fractures, 45 (8%) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 21 (47%) were treated in the hybrid OR. Hybrid OR patients underwent other procedures (exploratory laparotomy, [n=11], intracranial pressure monitor insertion [n=3], craniectomy (n=2), completion amputations [n=2], external fixation of extremities [n=2], resuscitative percutaneous balloon aortic occlusion [n=1], closure of complex lacerations [n=2]). Three had preperitoneal pelvic packing during laparotomy. Two patients had only angiography without other procedures. Hybrid OR and IR patients were similar in age (median, 53 vs 62 years, p=0.15), initial SBP (median, 123 vs 121 mmHg, p=0.57) but were more severely injured (median ISS, 34 vs. 22, p=0.001). Time to angiography from arrival (median, 123 vs 121 minutes, p=0.86) and total angiography time (median, 39 vs 52 minutes, p=0.29) were similar between the two groups. Mortality was not significantly different for hybrid OR patients compared to IR patients (7/21[33%] vs 2/24 [8%], p=0.06). Only one death was directly related to hemorrhage. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Time to initiation of pelvic angiography and total angiography time were similar in the hybrid OR compared to the IR department despite the need to perform associated procedures prior to angiography. For the critically injured patient with pelvic fractures requiring operative procedures, pelvic angiography can be efficiently accomplished in the hybrid OR.

Pettit<sup>1</sup>, A. Wilson<sup>1</sup>, J. Bardes<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>West Virginia University, Department Of Surgery, Morgantown, WV, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Central venous catheters (CVC) are commonly used throughout intensive care units (ICU). Central line blood stream infection (CLABSI) is a known complication with serious implications. Multiple sterilization strategies and product enhancements have been developed to prevent CLABSI, including the Biopatch&reg; Protective Disk with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). This pilot study aimed to evaluate the impact of sterilization technique on CVC biofilm formation. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This study was conducted in a single unit of the surgical ICU of a tertiary care facility. The ICU has routine care bundles for the care of central lines and below national average annual CLABSI rate. All CVC were inserted with chlorhexidine prep (CHG) or chlorhexidine + Biopatch (PATCH). Sterilization was by provider preference and there was no crossover. Samples were collected after removal and then refrigerated and processed within 2 hours. A 2.5mm punch was taken at the documented level at the skin. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized to identify the presence of biofilm and perform staging. Confocal microscopy (CLSM) was then utilized with Spryo&reg; stain to confirm the presence of glycocalyx and the Nikon NIS Elements GA3 software module was utilized to perform volumetric analysis. Analysis was performed on both the interior and exterior surface of the CVC. Chi square and T tests were used as appropriate, p&lt;0.05 was considered significant. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 24 CVC were collected, evenly distributed between CHG and PATCH. There was no significant difference in reason for line placement (p=0.2), 42% were placed for sepsis in the PATCH group and 33% in the CHG group. There were no positive line cultures in any subject, and 2/12 PATCH patients had bacteremia whereas 0/12 CHG patients had bacteremia. PATCH lines were in place a mean of 91 hours compared to 60 hours for CHG (p=0.19). 

The interior CVC had lower stage biofilms than the exterior. There were no stage 4 biofilms present inside of a CVC. Stage 4 biofilms were present on the outside of 50% of all the CVC (8/12 CHG, 4/12 PATCH). Mature (stage 3) biofilms were present on the interior of 7/12 CHG and 6/12 PATCH samples. Volume analysis found a non-significant increase in biofilm and glycocalyx in PATCH compared to CHG samples (Table 1). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This pilot study identified biofilms present both on the interior and exterior of CVC regardless of sterilization technique. It did not identify any statistically significant improvement in biofilm formation based on sterilization technique. There were several limitations: small sample size, and increased CLABSI risk in the PATCH group. Additional study is needed to identify optimal techniques to reduce biofilm formation on CVC.

The Riley Hospital for Children Trauma Registry was utilized to identify intubated pediatric trauma patients from 2016-2020. Patients were excluded if intubated for less than 48 hours. VAP was defined as positive if patients met either Centers for Disease Control definition and or were clinically diagnosed with and treated for VAP. Univariate and multivariate modeling was performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
A total of 171 patients met inclusion criteria and 43 (25%) were diagnosed with VAP. The median age was 8 years (2-13) and ISS was 26.5 (22-35). The median duration of intubation was 203.8 hours (117.3-331.3). The overall mortality was 55 (32.2%). While variables such as lower age resulted in a higher likelihood of mortality, VAP diagnosis was not associated with increased mortality. BAL analysis displayed that the most common cultured bacteria were H. influenzae, Staph. aureus, and Strep. Pneumoniae with most VAPs being diagnosed on day 2 of admission. When analyzing the impact of age, ISS, intubation hours, ICU days, and GI prophylaxis on VAP, only age was significantly associated with VAP: for each year the odds of VAP rose by 10%.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
A quarter of the pediatric trauma patients were diagnosed with VAP during the study period. No modifiable risk factors were found for VAP with only patient age demonstrating significance for the diagnosis. Further investigation into VAP definition and prevention in pediatric trauma patients should occur given it&rsquo;s prevalence.

Gordon<sup>1</sup>, R. Behm<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Guthrie Clinic, Trauma And Surgical Critical Care, Sayre, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: To maintain accreditation, trauma centers must comply to strict evidence-based guidelines which dictate that 90% of all trauma-related injuries be admitted to a surgical service. There is a role for non-surgical services (NSS) in the admission of trauma cases where the patient requires complicated medical management which supercedes a minor traumatic injury; however, the overall percentage of trauma admissions to NSS must not exceed 10%. Our institution recently noted a rising trend of trauma admissions to NSS. To combat this, we established a protocol that required every patient presenting to the emergency room diagnosed with an acute fracture to be triaged and evaluated by the trauma team. Our study aims to investigate the impact of this protocol on trauma patients being admitted to a NSS and determine if there has been a change in patient outcomes under this policy. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A single site retrospective review of adult trauma patients who were admitted between June 1, 2021, the initial date of our new trauma protocol, to July 31, 2021 was performed. Basic demographic and patient factors, along with admission and outcome data were collected. This data was then compared with historic, pre-protocol data from Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020. Welch&rsquo;s t-test and Fisher&rsquo;s exact test were used to assess the success of the protocol and compare patient outcomes between surgical services and NSS.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1086 patients were identified in the historic pre-protocol data and 227 patients in the post-protocol data. Historically, 247 patients (22.74%) were admitted to NSS. After implementing the protocol, 24 patients (10.57%) were admitted to NSS. This decrease was significant (p &lt; 0.001). There was also a statistically significant improvement in patient outcomes. Trauma patients admitted to surgical services had a shorter length of stay (LOS) than those admitted to NSS by 2.3 days (p&lt;0.001). They also had shorter average time to operative management of their fractures, averaging 783 minutes faster than patients admitted to NSS (p&lt;0.002). Patient factors and outcomes of pre-protocol patients admitted to a surgical service and those admitted to a NSS can be seen in Table 1. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Having the trauma team initially evaluate and triage all fracture patients presenting to the emergency department significantly decreased the percentage of fracture patients being admitted to NSS ensuring our trauma center will meet accreditation requirements. In addition, our data showed trauma patients admitted to a surgical service have shorter time to operation and length of stay (LOS) despite a significantly higher injury severity score (ISS).

Glass<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>New Jersey Medical School, Surgery, Newark, NJ, USA&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>New Jersey Medical School, Pharmacy, Newark, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Broad spectrum empiric antibiotics are standard of care when infection is suspected. The benefits of early utilization of effective antibiotics are well-documented. However, the negative effects of inappropriate use of antibiotics have led to antimicrobial stewardship mandates. Recent data have demonstrated the utility of using MRSA PCR nasal screening to steward anti-MRSA empiric antibiotics in pneumonia. We hypothesize that MRSA PCR nasal swabs would also be effective to rule out other MRSA infection in inpatients to effectively limit unnecessary antibiotics.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a single-center retrospective chart review of all adult (age &gt; 18) patient encounters from January 2019-Feburary 2021 with MRSA PCR nasal testing. We then reviewed all charts to evaluate for the presence of infection, based on lab cultures and sensitivities, as the Gold Standard. Negative predictive value was calculated from 2x2 contingency tables.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We had 998 patients with MRSA nares screens who had any infection. Prevalence of MRSA infection among all infections was 7.5%. MRSA nasal swabs demonstrated a negative predictive value of 99.6% for MRSA urinary tract infection (UTI), 99% for MRSA bacteremia, 97% for MRSA pneumonia, and 96% for MRSA wound infection. Overall, MRSA PCR nasal swabs had a sensitivity of 68%, specificity of 88%, positive predictive value of 23%, and negative predictive value of 98% for all infections.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: MRSA PCR swabs have a high negative predictive value for all infections, and not just pneumonia. These data support the use of MRSA PCR nasal swabs to rule out MRSA infection and thereby discontinue MRSA coverage in hospitalized patients requiring empiric antibiotic coverage. The implementation of MRSA screening when checking for infection may help limit inappropriate antibiotic use and thereby decrease the development of antibiotic resistance, morbidity, mortality, and costs of care.

The WHO recommends training lay first responders (LFRs) as the first step toward formal EMS development. Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) systems are the recognized next step but have not been studied in LMICs. We created an EMD system in Makeni, Sierra Leone, hypothesizing that mobile phone technology can effectively coordinate and dispatch LFRs, thereby creating an affordable rapid-dispatch EMD implementation model for LMICs.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Ten highly-active LFRs were recruited from among 4,529 LFRs we trained in 2019 to participate in a prospective, randomized, emergency simulation-based study. Ten emergency simulation scenarios were created covering airway, hemorrhage, fracture, and extrication management, which matched the proportion of injury conditions encountered by LFRs across 1,850 previous patient incidents (June-December 2019). Each of the ten scenarios were then launched five times for a total of 50 simulations over 3 months in a randomized order, with each emergency simulation location randomized along 10km of highway in Makeni. To replicate real-world emergency conditions, LFR participants were blinded to emergency dispatch time, date, and scenario to simulate and assess LFR response time and LFR first aid skill performance under direct observation with standardized patient actors using a scenario-specific checklist. EMD system implementation cost was tracked using a one-way sensitivity analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: LFRs initially trained with a 5-hour curriculum and administered a refresher training provide high-quality prehospital care during simulated emergencies. Median first aid skill scenario-specific checklist completion under direct observation with a standardized patient across 50 simulations was 89% (IQR: 78%, 90%), with a mean scenario score across the ten scenario types ranging from 76% (for combined fracture/extrication) to 97% (for airway management). Median total LFR response interval (initial notification to arrival on simulated emergency scene) was 5 minutes 39 seconds (IQR: 0:03:51, 0:09:18). EMD system setup cost $3,605USD, with a recurrent monthly cost of $1,368.75USD.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Applying mobile phone technology is a feasible and affordable alternative for EMD system creation in resource-limited settings to coordinate and facilitate rapid LFR dispatch. EMD systems implemented alongside LFR programs may expand emergency care coverage and access in resource-limited sub-Saharan African settings.

Currently there is an unmet demand for understanding the population&#39;s beliefs about breast cancer and potential barriers for participating in the screening program. The objective of this project is to develop and validate the Eastern Armenian version of Champion&rsquo;s Health Belief Model Scale (CHBMS) in order to measure perceptions and attitudes towards breast cancer and its screening in Armenia. 


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Observational study using telephone-administered surveys conducted in 2019-2020 among randomly selected women aged 35-65 residing in capital Yerevan, Armenia with no prior history of breast cancer. For proper validation of the survey tool, validity was estimated by correlating answers to the questionnaire among participants fluent in both Eastern Armenian and English conducted in both languages with average latency of 14 days. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency of the Armenian version of CHBMS were estimated by Pearson&rsquo;s Correlation and Cronbach&rsquo;s-&alpha; coefficients respectively.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The reconciled translated version of the questionnaire was deemed valid with Pearson&rsquo;s R coefficient ranging 0.76-0.96 (N=20, P&lt;0.0001) for all 5 CHBMS domains (susceptibility, benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, fear). The Armenian version of the questionnaire was further tested for internal consistency (N=104), for which Cronbach&rsquo;s-&alpha; coefficient ranged between 0.77 and 0.94 in all five domains of CHBMS. 26 out of the 104 participants successfully completed the retests, through which test-retest reliability estimated by Pearson&rsquo;s R-Coefficient ranged 0.71 - 0.97 (P&lt;0.0001) for all 5 CHBMS domains. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The translated Armenian version of CHBMS is a valid, internally consistent, and reliable research tool that can be utilized to investigate current attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions about breast cancer among Eastern Armenian speaking women.

Epidemiology, Department For Sport And Health Sciences, Munich, BAVARIA, Germany","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Chiapas has the lowest Human Development Index and is the poorest state in Mexico. Poor access to healthcare in this region has garnered widespread attention for years, including the burden created by surgical conditions. Since 2011, Compa&ntilde;eros en Salud (CES) has supported various health services in rural Chiapas. We sought to characterize the financial burden related to surgery among these rural communities.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a pilot household community survey of three rural communities (Capitan Luis A.Vidal, Laguna del Cofre, and Reforma) in the Fraylesca Region of Chiapas, Mexico. The survey was administered by 10 data collectors and 2 volunteers. Data was collected on CommCare using tablets in May 2021. The surgical component of the survey was adapted from standardized tools to assess surgical financial risk protection. All financial data is reflected in international dollars (I$). Data was analyzed with descriptive statistics; Fisher&#39;s exact and Student&rsquo;s t-test were used to evaluate categorical and continuous variables respectively. Catastrophic expenditure (surgical costs &gt;10% of monthly income) and impoverishing expenditure (surgical costs pushing households below the poverty line) were calculated. All statistical analyses were done in STATA 17.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1,103 people were surveyed, out of which 97 had undergone surgery in the last 5 years. Amongst those who underwent surgery, 88% were farmers with 72% with primary or no education. Only 20% had insurance whilst 92% received government welfare. Monthly median household earnings were $172.8 (IQR $309.6) and expenditures were $144.3 (IQR $180.3). Most surgeries were elective procedures (72%), with 25% of all surgeries being appendectomies. The median direct medical cost for surgery amounted to $149.3 (IQR $417.9), with additional direct non-medical costs of $270.5 (IQR $631.2). Indirect costs were also incurred in the form of time lost from work, with a median of 12 (IQR 27) days lost. Comparison of direct costs to income showed 96% of patients had catastrophic expenditure due to surgery. 34% of patients were below the poverty line before surgery, with a 54% increase to a total of 91% facing impoverishing expenditure post-surgery. 41% of people had financial hardship, in the form of a loan or selling assets, to help pay for surgical costs. We found a statistically significant association with patients who received surgery via a surgical campaign (p =0.018) being less likely to have financial hardship as opposed to those who did not.

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This pilot survey highlighted the severe impoverishing and catastrophic expenditures incurred by surgery in these communities. Surgery is established as part of universal health coverage but has pushed many households into further debilitating poverty in Chiapas. State policies and interventions to create financial risk protection for surgical patients are urgently needed to help break the poverty cycle and improve health outcomes.

Liver transplantation is generally performed in specialized centers that provide high level of care, which is frequently associated with high healthcare related costs, which can be driven by OR time, surgical staff, and materials used during the surgery. Through work in global transplant we observed that the number of surgical instruments used in transplantation varies across the world, which can ultimately impact transplant-related costs. Specifically, we aimed to determine the number of instruments utilized in liver transplant cases in hospitals located in different countries and continents.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a cross-sectional, observational study. Transplant centers who are members of our global surgery collaboration group were invited to participate in the study. Centers were queried on the number of surgical instruments used in a first liver-only transplant case (ie, repeat transplant, simultaneous liver-kidney transplant cases were not included). Pearson&rsquo;s test was used to assess the correlation between number of surgical instruments with gross domestic product (GDP) and transplant program years of experience.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Five transplant centers were invited to participate, of which all are included in this study (100% response rate). Transplant centers were located in North America (n = 4), and Asia (n = 1). The number of instruments used in a first liver-only transplant were 70, 123, 145, 239, and 342 among participating centers, respectively. The center using the least number of instruments (70) was located in Mexico, whereas the transplant program using the highest number of instruments (342) was located in the United States. No correlation was identified between the number of instruments and program years of experience (r=0.86, p=0.064) or national GDP (r= 0.45, p= 0.45).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is variability in the number of instruments used for liver transplantation, there is no correlation in the geographical area, national GDP or years of experience .This preliminary data indicates that fewer instruments can be used for the same type of surgery. Studies have shown that for each procedure there is a recurrent expenditure for hospitals due to the usage and sterilization related damage and replacement of instruments. In future studies we aim to include other variables like OR time, suture materials, immunosuppression and costs to further investigate if a modification would significantly decrease transplant surgery costs worldwide.

Armed conflicts are increasing globally due to political unrest and the broader effects of climate change. The locations of these conflicts are mostly in low resource settings. These nations often lack a robust and resilient healthcare system to be able to provide adequate surgical care to their civilian populations. Without resources to provide quality surgical care, it becomes nearly impossible to provide quality emergency surgery and trauma care similar to that in high-income countries. To understand and help aid organizations provide resources and address the surgical needs of populations facing armed conflict, a matrix to identify variables and help with interventions was envisioned.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

To augment the 2019 Stanford Humanitarian Response in Conflict Consensus report, a capacity and needs matrix to facilitate surgical care during armed conflict was developed. A previously published global surgery matrix based on the PIPES (Personnel, Infrastructure, Procedures, Equipment, and Supplies) surgical capacity tool was adapted to this context. Modifications were based on the collective analysis of direct field experience and published literature to reflect the current challenges of modern conflicts.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

The novel matrix incorporates 108 variables (Table 1). These variables are grossly divided into local and international agency components to address the issue of who is providing care. Using a time continuum of pre-conflict, conflict, and post-conflict allows organizations to concetrate on when during the conflict to target their intervention. In addition to the previously used PIPES categories, a sixth category called standards was included that addresses the issues such as information technology, data systems, quality improvement programs, and patient safety.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

The surgical needs of civilians in conflict are an ever increasing and challenging endeavour, it is expected that more organizations and local ministries of health will require assistance in these complex settings. The matrix facilitates planning by delineating the complexity and magnitudes of needs contextually in relation to specific points in time, location, and scope. Pilot testing of this matrix to obtain feedback from end users is the next step in development. Groups such as the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Medecins Sans Frontieres are potential partners for this pilot. Ultimately, peri-conflict preparedness should increase and improve surgical outcomes and reduce in death and disabilities around the world.

In high income countries, where parenteral nutrition is readily available, initiation of and transition to full enteral nutrition is often delayed. In low- and middle-income countries, enteral feeding may be more aggressively pursued due to parenteral nutrition unavailability. This study seeks to examine clinical factors and decision-making processes that guide nutrition practices in surgical neonates in the United States (US) and Kenya.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A REDCap survey was developed and distributed to pediatric surgeons and fellows at four tertiary centers, two in the US and two in Kenya. Thirteen responses (56.5% response rate) were collected and analyzed using REDCap and SPSS 25. Clinical factors were ranked for each group using average rankings from complete responses. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Responses were collected from ten pediatric surgery attendings (8 US, 2 Kenya) and three fellows (1 US, 2 Kenya). EEN protocols are followed in the US and Kenya for pyloric stenosis (88.9%). Other protocols are followed in Kenya for tracheoesophageal fistula (n=2), intestinal atresia (n=2), and gastroschisis (n=2). Protocols for pyloric stenosis (n=6) at three institutions include EEN within 24-48 hours of the operation. The top three clinical factors valued by surgeons in Kenya (n=2) and the US (n=7) for the initiation and advancement of enteral nutrition differed. Factors were similarly ranked among foregut and hindgut procedures in each cohort (see table). In Kenya, surgeons reported that barriers to parenteral nutrition use include cost (100%) and limited availability (75%). Among all respondents, the primary perceived barrier to achieving full enteral nutrition was patient gut dysmotility (76.9%). All respondents felt similarly (53.8%) or more (46.2%) proactive in feeding surgical neonates compared to their peers. However, 38.5% of respondents (4 US, 1 Kenya) also felt that surgeons at their institution are not aggressive enough at promoting EEN in surgical neonates.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Nutritional practices in surgical neonates are dependent on clinician decision-making processes and patient factors. Surgeons in the US and Kenya value different clinical factors for the initiation and advancement of enteral feeds. Real-world nutrition practices will be evaluated in an adjunct observational study, which aims to inform EEN protocols in both practice settings.

In addition, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery identified that 81 million people annually were at risk of catastrophic expenditure due to surgical costs. A major component of calculating key metrics is surgical &ldquo;out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE),&rdquo; which has previously primarily been modelled and lacks standardized reporting tools. This study aims to use a tool developed specifically to identify OOPE to accurately assess surgical OOPE and financial burden on patients.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A structured questionnaire was developed for OOPE and financial hardships, which was defined as borrowing money, selling land, job loss, inability to send children to school, or receiving donations. We conducted a cross-sectional study of all patients who underwent inpatient surgical procedures during a 28 day data collection period at Saveetha Medical Hospital in Chennai,India. Patients were interviewed by a healthcare worker prior to discharge. Data was analyzed for direct medical and non-medical costs incurred with surgery. Predictors of financial hardship were investigated by multiple binary logistic regression models. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The questionnaire was delivered to 101 individuals, of whom 57 (56%) were women and 44 (44%) were men, with a mean age of 37.9 &plusmn; 1.8 years. The majority did not have health insurance (66%). On average, there were 4.2 &plusmn; 0.2 people per household and individuals took 6.6 &plusmn; 1.2 hours to reach the hospital, with 67% travelling by public transport. The most common surgeries were in the head and neck region (35%), and 22% of patients had post-operative ICU stays. Nearly all (98%) individuals incurred direct medical costs (mean $4,245.7 &plusmn; $1175.8), and all (100%) individuals incurred direct non-medical costs (mean $231.3 &plusmn; $51.8). Half of the resopondents (49.5%) demonstrated hardship in financing surgical care. On logistic regression analysis, statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.05) were noted with hardship financing more likely in patients with larger families, no health insurance and those requiring ICU admission [see Table 1].


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The development of a tool to assess OOPE for surgical care in India was feasible, indicating promise for dissemination to other regions and the development of standardized OOPE measurement. The results demonstrate that the overall cost of surgery was high at $4393, and was associated with significant financial hardship in half of the patients. Identification of significant predictors of financial hardships using the OOPE tool may help guide government officials and healthcare organizations for potential interventions.

Thus, this study sought to investigate the access to mentors among medical students in Brazil and determine whether the access is different among students of different genders. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A cross-sectional study was performed using an anonymous survey in Portuguese, which was distributed via social media platforms in June of 2021 to medical students enrolled in schools recognized by the Ministry of Education in Brazil. The survey contained 24 questions, including demographic data and the presence of mentors. Statistical analysis was performed with a chi-square or fisher&rsquo;s exact tests to assess the relationships between different variables. Results with a p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the total 954 respondents, 748 (78%) were cisgender women, 194 (20%) cisgender men, 3 (0.31%) gender-queer, and 2 (0.21%) transgender men. There was no difference by gender in students who had mentors with 162 (22%) female medical students reporting having a mentor compared to 37 (19%) male medical students (p=0.2665). The majority of mentors identified by students were cisgender male (n=113, 58%), with no difference in gender distribution of mentors between male and female students (p=0.4904). Most medical students reported feeling comfortable discussing gender-based topics with their mentors (male 63% vs female 76%).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our findings suggest that the majority of Brazilian medical students do not have a mentor. Despite most medical students being women in Brazil, most mentors are men. However, there was no difference in availability of mentorship between male and female students.

Musculoskeletal trauma poses a significant risk in Latin America because the incidence of trauma is substantial and yet treatment protocols vary widely by institution. Region-specific clinical research is necessary in order to answer clinical questions and shape health policy. In an effort to overcome these barriers, a team of more than 100 surgeon leaders representing 18 Latin American countries developed the Asociaci&oacute;n de Cirujanos Traumat&oacute;logos de las Am&eacute;ricas (ACTUAR; www.actuarla.org). One of ACTUAR&rsquo;s first collaborative projects was a prospective observational multi-center study evaluating the quality of life following the treatment of open tibial fractures in Latin America. Before enrolling patients, the central organizing center, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), sent two research assistants to various hospitals in Mexico to assist with site enrollment and staff on-boarding. The purpose of this study is to identify the barriers encountered by the research assistants in order to better support future orthopaedic research efforts.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

US-based research coordinators were recruited to share their experiences with initiating the ACTUAR open tibia study at various sites in Mexico. Interviews were conducted via phone and zoom. Interviews identified common barriers experienced during site enrollment and on-boarding phases of the ACTUAR open tibia study protocols at the respective sites.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Barriers were organized into the following three categories: structural, logistical, and intrapersonal barriers. Major structural barriers lay in the dichotomy between private and public institutions in Mexico. Private institutions had the financial resources and faculty who had time to conduct research but lacked the patient volume to substantially contribute to patient enrollment for clinical research. By contrast, public institutions encounter more patients eligible for study enrollment, but lack the staff and financial resources to conduct a study. Logistical barriers included unclear and varied ethical review processes, internet connectivity issues, and difficulties with patient follow-up. Patient enrollment being the responsibility of local residents led to some additional barriers. Residents often have limited time and motivation to conduct clinical research at certain institutions, given the small impact it can have on career trajectory.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

There are a variety of barriers to research stakeholders who initiated a prospective orthopedic clinical research study in Mexico. The benefit of addressing and overcoming these barriers and conducting meaningful collaborative orthopedics research in Latin America is an important step towards building locally led research capacity.

Longitudinal perioperative data is sorely needed in order to better understand surgical outcomes and to develop quality improvement programs. However, there is dearth of literature on surgical outcomes form LMICs. The aim of this study was was to review the barriers and challenges to developing surgical registries and conducting surgical outcome research in LMICs.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a scoping review of literature using PubMed, Embase, Scopus and GoogleScholar. Keywords included &lsquo;surgery&rsquo;, &lsquo;outcomes research&rsquo;, &lsquo;registries&rsquo;, &lsquo;barriers&rsquo;, and synonymous MESH derivatives. Articles found were subsequently reference-mined. Original research and reviews on barriers to surgical research in LMICs published between 1990-2020 were included. Barriers were categorized as per the Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) framework. Technical, Organizational, and Behavioral factors were reviewed and summarized.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our literature review revealed 12 articles out of which 10 focused specifically on the creation, success and obstacles faced during implementation of trauma registries. Technical factors included difficulty in having access to and using technology for data entry. Organizational factors included availability of resources, financial constraints, human resources and lack of consistent electricity. Behavioral factors included team commitment, job constraints and excessive clinical burden leading to decreased compliance and information collection over time. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Aside from experiences from trauma registry implementation, there is little to no published literature focused on barriers faced in developing and maintaining a surgical outcome or perioperative registry. The most notable barriers were constraints in human and financial capital, technological deficiencies for data collection, and inconsistency in data quality control. There is an immediate need to study and understand barriers and facilitators to the continuous collection of surgical outcomes in LMICs.

The objective of this study was to characterize patient and provider perceptions of how Covid-19 impacted dietary habits, physical activity, and adherence to recommended follow-up care after bariatric surgery.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Semi-structured interviews with bariatric surgery patients, primary care providers (PCPs), and health psychologists from multiple academic and private practice settings in Wisconsin were conducted from April-November 2020. Patients who had undergone primary bariatric surgery and had at least one-year of postoperative follow-up were eligible for inclusion. PCPs and health psychologists were required to have cared for bariatric surgery patients. Participants described how the Covid-19 pandemic affected their postoperative experience within three domains: dietary habits, physical activity, and adherence to recommended follow-up care. Interview guides were created from a hybrid of two conceptual models: Torain&rsquo;s Surgical Disparities Model and Andersen&rsquo;s Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. Five study team members generated codes, which were grouped into themes using directed content analysis.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Thirty-four participants were interviewed, including 24 patients (12 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 12 sleeve gastrectomy), six PCPs, and four health psychologists. 85% were white and 85% were female. Table 1 displays three themes that describe how Covid-19 disrupted weight-related behaviors along with representative patient and provider quotes. Changes to dietary routines arose from increased grazing behaviors due to more time at home and decreased fresh food access due to fear of grocery shopping. Physical activity routines were altered due to facility closures, fear of Covid-19 exposure, and an increase in sedentary lifestyle. The shift to telemedicine visits provided more scheduling flexibility but was sometimes perceived as impersonal. Financial and psychosocial stress arose from job losses and furloughs that led to loss of health insurance and food insecurity. Deaths among family and friends also disrupted social support networks. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Covid-19 had significant effects on the post-operative bariatric surgery patient experience by decreasing access to fresh foods and physical activity venues, disrupting social support networks and established routines, and increasing stress levels. The pandemic is not yet over, and thus bariatric surgery patients need ongoing support in these areas.

Fullum<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Howard University College Of Medicine, Department Of Surgery, Washington, DC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Obesity, defined as a BMI &ge; 30kg/m<sup>2</sup> is a chronic multisystem disease associated with multiple health and economic consequences. Bariatric surgery has been proven a safe and effective treatment of obesity in patients that have failed medical treatment, yet there is underutilization. Two decades ago, a big discrepancy in demographic and socioeconomic factors between the US population eligible for Bariatric surgery and those that received the procedure was identified. A typical adult meeting the criteria for Bariatric surgery was more likely Black, female, impoverished, publicly insured, and less educated. At the time, 5% of the population had Class II obesity and 2% had Class III obesity. As the prevalence of obesity and Bariatric surgeries performed have increased since then, it is important to determine the effect of access on the population. Our goal was to determine if access to Bariatric surgery had improved in the past 2 decades. We determined the current prevalence of obesity, compared characteristics of adults eligible for Bariatric surgery to adults that utilized surgery, and evaluated the differences in access to Bariatric surgery over time.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The NHANES 2015-2016 dataset was used to determine the adult obese and Bariatric eligible population. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with Bariatric surgery eligibility. The NIS 2015-2016 database was then used to identify characteristics of the patients that received Bariatric surgery. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were compared between the Bariatric eligible adults and those that had undergone Bariatric surgery. These characteristics were then compared to results from Livingston et al in 2000.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 93,616,845 obese adults in the US between 2015-2016, representing 39% of the adult population. 10% had class II obesity while 8% had class III obesity. In our study, interestingly, income, insurance, and education had no significant effect on Bariatric surgery eligibility. Compared to the Bariatric non-eligible population, a disproportionate amount of the population was female (OR, p) (1.6, &lt;0.001), Black (1.3, 0.018)(Ref White), and Diabetic (2.6, &lt;0.001). Of the 348,900 Bariatric surgeries performed, fewer than expected procedures were in Males (21% vs 39%), Hispanics (13% vs 18%), and patients in the lowest median income quartile (25% vs 43%). When comparing characteristics of patients who received Bariatric surgery from 2000, utilization had increased in Males (14% to 21%), Blacks (9% to 18%), and Medicaid-insured individuals (8% to 16%). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The prevalence of obesity has increased in the US adult population. Bariatric surgery utilization is increasing, and disparities in access are decreasing.

Given this, we sought to study if the reasons patients opted to undergo bariatric surgery or selected the specific procedure differed between white and Black patients.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In this convergent parallel designed mixed method study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Patients had been recruited via criterion-based sampling so that a 50:50 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to sleeve gastrectomy procedural split and a 75:25 private to public insurance split was achieved. Quantitative data included demographic, socioeconomic, and responses to validated weight stigma questionnaires: the stigmatizing situations inventory (SSI) and the weight self-stigma questionnaire (WSSQ). Qualitative data were the transcribed semi-structured interviews regarding reasons for undergoing bariatric surgery. We applied the framework method of content analysis to define and code themes from open-ended responses so that consensus was achieved before comparing the frequency of themes for white versus Black patients using Dedoose.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Seventy-four patients were interviewed; 24% (N=18) were Black and 76% (N=56) were white with 45% of white patients and 67% of Black patients undergoing a sleeve gastrectomy (p-value 0.089). Groups were similar in terms of age, gender (majority female), baseline-BMI, obesity-related comorbidities, educational attainment (majority associates), and income (plurality &lt;$50,000). There was a statistically significant difference in housing with 70% vs 39% of white and Black patients owning their home (p-value 0.026). There were also differences in reported stigma measures. White patients reported experiencing three stigmatizing situations significantly more often and a larger proportion of white patients had high WSSQ scores.

Analysis of structured interview questions identified four themes as motivations for undergoing surgery and three as reasons for selecting specific procedure with subthemes identified. The decision to pursue surgery was driven primarily by medical and last resort reasons while research and public perception drove the specific surgery selected. These were the predominant themes for both Black and white patients (Figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While patient decision making was similar for white and Black patients, other differences, like measured weight stigma, were significantly different.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is generally associated with increased risk of perioperative cardiovascular complications and poor wound healing. Due to its prevalence among candidates for bariatric operations, metabolic syndrome is of particular interest to surgeons. We used a national bariatric database to examine acute postoperative outcomes of patients with MetS undergoing laparoscopic or robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy (SG).

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Adults (&ge;18 years) undergoing SG were identified using the 2015-2019 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) participant data files. Presence of MetS was ascertained as the presence of diabetes and two of the following: BMI&ge;30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of MetS with surgical approach, operative time, same-day discharge, postoperative intervention or reoperation, unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 30-day rehospitalization.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Among 557,470 SG patients who met study criteria, 18% had MetS. Patients with MetS were, on average, older (51.5 vs 42.6 years, p&lt;0.001) and had greater burden of systemic comorbidities as defined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Classification System (ASA class &ge;3: 89% vs 73%, p&lt;0.001) compared to those without. Among those with hypertension or diabetes, the MetS group was more often dependent on medications for blood pressure control (25% vs 16%, p&lt;0.001) and insulin (32 vs 16%, p&lt;0.001). The proportion of sleeve gastrectomies performed with robotic assistance was similar between the groups (0.09 vs 0.09, p=0.03). After adjustment, MetS was associated with lower odds for same-day discharge but greater odds for unplanned ICU admission, subsequent intervention or reoperation, and 30-day unplanned readmissions (Figure). After adjustment for available patient and operative factors, presence of MetS did not alter the odds of undergoing a robotic SG or independently impact operative time.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
With nearly 1/5 of SG candidates meeting criteria for the disorder, metabolic syndrome appears to be associated with increased odds of unplanned ICU admission and 30-day rehospitalization but similar operating times. While patients with MetS are known to benefit from bariatric operations in the long term, this cohort deserves special considerations in the perioperative period.

Due to recent increase in opioid related overdose and dependence, many alternative methods have been examined to decrease opioid utilization in the post-operative period. We seek to determine if scheduled administration of non-narcotic analgesics is more opioid-sparing than PRN dosing. We also tested if utilization of acetaminophen and NSAIDs will decrease inpatient cost. 

Materials and <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

With IRB sanction, we reviewed records from 45 patients who underwent breast reduction between 7/1/2015 and 6/30/2019. The total narcotic medication received (converted into MME), amount and means of administration of non-narcotics, and pain scores were recorded. We additionally calculated the cost of each medication administration using LexiComp &reg; database. Parametric, two-tailed t-test was used for statistical significance. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 

The average MME for breast reduction patients receiving non-narcotics on a prn basis was 131.99+10.02. Those receiving scheduled non-narcotics had MME of 103.17+4.48 (p-value: 0.01). Furthermore, the average pain score for patients receiving non narcotics on a prn basis was 2.06+0.79 and those receiving scheduled non narcotic analgesic was 0.93+0.35 (p-value: 0.2) The average medication cost for patients receiving non-narcotics on a prn was 90.63+8.51 and average cost for patients receiving scheduled non-narcotics was 27.91+2.02 (p-vaclue &lt;0.01)

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 

We show definitive evidence supporting using scheduled acetaminophen with ibuprofen results in decreased opioid consumption while achieving adequate analgesia. In addition, utilization of scheduled acetaminophen and ibuprofen resulted in decreased medication cost. We are in the process of modifying our ERAS based on the above findings

Collawn<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department Of Surgery, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Superomedial pedicle breast reduction has become a popular technique given that both functional and aesthetic results are consistently achieved. Aesthetically, improved nipple areola complex (NAC) projection on the breast mound is one of the goals of breast reduction. This article is a retrospective review demonstrating significant increases in NAC angles along with overall decrease of axilla to nipple distances utilizing the superomedial pedicle technique.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A review of preoperative and postoperative measurements of the axilla to nipple distance and the nipple angles was performed on the last 7 breast reductions undergoing a superomedial pedicle breast reduction at our institution. This resulted in 14 breasts for measurement, analysis, and subsequent comparison of patient variables.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our seven-patient cohort was an average of 36 years old and had an average BMI of 36.8. The average breast reduction (14 total) was 526.3 g. The axilla to nipple distance measured along the lateral chest wall shortened an average of 9.8 cm (54%) from an average of 18.2 cm to 8.4 cm following breast reduction. The average nipple angle on the breast mound was 6.58 degrees preoperatively and increased to an average of 29.9 degrees postoperatively (368%).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Breast reductions using the superomedial pedicle technique can reliably be expected to increase NAC angles as well as nipple position on the lateral chest wall. These results show a consistent aesthetic benefit along with great preservation of a functional breast.

McClellan<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>McClellan Plastic Surgery, Morgantown, WV, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Basilar thumb arthritis occurs at the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. Diagnosis is clinical, but the Eaton classification (I-IV) is a radiographic scale used to grade severity. Patients with severe or refractory disease are often treated surgically. Though operative treatments involving trapeziectomy have been shown to be effective for pain reduction in aggregate, results are variable, outcomes are often short-lived, and permanent alteration to the anatomy of the thumb base may lead to decreased function. A potential minimally invasive alternative to trapeziectomy-based surgery for treatment of basilar thumb arthritis is intra-articular fat grafting.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
A total of 18 cases of basilar thumb arthritis were prospectively treated with intra-articular fat grafting. In each case, fluoroscopy was used to clearly identify the joint space. &ldquo;Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand&rdquo; (DASH) score (0-100) was assessed pre-operatively and at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months post-operatively. Average DASH scores were compared over time, and t-tests were used to assess statistical significance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Average pre-operative pain score was 8.00 (SD 1.33) on a 10-point scale. Eaton stage was available in 14 of the 18 cases: 5 stage II, 5 stage III, and 4 stage IV. Average pre-operative DASH score was 52.15 (95% CI: 43.94 to 60.36; n=18). Average post-operative DASH scores were 21.80 (95% CI: 15.86 to 27.74; n=15) at 1 month post-operatively, 18.91 (95% CI: 10.88 to 26.94; n=11) at 6 months post-operatively, and 26.88 (95% CI: 17.58 to 36.18; n=16) at 12 months post-operatively (Table 1). Average improvement in DASH score from pre-operative baseline following fat grafting was 30.35 (95% CI: 19.39 to 41.28; p= 0.001) at 1 month post-operatively, 33.24 (95% CI: 20.39 to 46.07; p= 0.001) at 6 months post-operatively, and 25.27 (95% CI: 12.41 to 38.11; p= 0.003) at 12 months post-operatively (Table 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The DASH score has been validated as a longitudinal scale to assess upper extremity disability, with a 10-point difference found to be clinically significant. In this study, DASH score improvements after intra-articular fat grafting for the treatment of basilar thumb arthritis were both statistically and clinically significant at 1, 6, and 12 months post-operatively, representing a significant increase in upper extremity functionality. Our data are consistent with findings of a 2017 small prospective study conducted by Herold et al. These data indicate that further higher-powered studies to directly compare autologous intra-articular fat grafting to trapeziectomy-based surgery for the treatment of basilar thumb arthritis are indicated.

Face and upper extremity reconstruction via transplantation have become successful option for selected patients with severe tissue and functional deficit for which conventional reconstructive options are no longer available. Despite clear benefit in selected situations, VCAs have significant potential for complications similar to visceral organ transplantation that include surgical, immunologic and immunosuppression-related complications. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively review the published reports of VCAs and analyze the associated complications.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A MEDLINE database via PubMed was searched to identify published reports of VCAs performed between 1998 and 2020. Relevant media and press conferences reports were included as well. Only face and upper extremity transplants were included and all other VCAs excluded. Complications related to the VCA were recorded and reviewed including their clinical characteristics and complications.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 114 patients underwent facial (42%) or upper extremity (58%) transplantation. 3 patients received simultaneous face/bilateral upper extremity transplantation, 2 patients underwent face re-transplantation. Overall, surgical complication rate was 23%, with vascular anastomosis thrombosis being most common surgical complication. Acute and chronic rejection was identified in 89% and 11% of patients, respectively. 58% of patients experienced opportunistic infection. Impaired glucose metabolism was most common immunosuppression-related complication other than infection. 23% of patients (11% face, 29% upper extremity) ultimately experienced partial or complete allograft loss.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The advent of VCA has revolutionized the world of reconstruction surgery. VCA provides options for patients with severe disfigurements not feasible for conventional reconstructive options, however, there is significant potential for transplantation related complications and this potential remains high. Opportunistic infections, impairment of glucose metabolism, renal insufficiency, and adverse psychologic response among other VCA-related complications, are significant source of morbidity and potential mortality. In the setting of non-life saving procedures, VCA remains a procedure with potential high cost related to immunosuppression and surgery-associated complications and therefore represents a topic for ongoing ethical discussion regarding indication criteria where benefits overweight risks. Strong emphasis should be applied on patient strict selection with thorough and complex pre-operative evaluation to reduce risk of patient-related severe complications and consideration for alternatives.

Distal radius fractures (DRF) are one of the most common orthopedic injuries leading to Emergency Department and doctors&rsquo; office visits, with approximately 70% of them treated nonoperatively and managed in the ambulatory setting alone. Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with opioid abuse and advancements in multimodal pain management, practitioners continue to rely on opioid medications as part of the treatment protocol for DRF. Opioid prescribing patterns for DRF in the ambulatory setting have been inadequately studied and warrant further examination.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data were extracted from the United States National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) from 2007-2016. Utilizing ICD codes, all visits to Emergency Departments and doctors&rsquo; offices for DRF were identified. Demographic and clinical variables of interest included sex, age, race/ethnicity, geographic region, and expected payment source, as well as prescription of opioid or non-opioid analgesics at each visit. Opioid prescribing patterns were evaluated over time and survey data were analyzed for statistical significance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
During the study timeframe, 15,572,531 total visits for DRF were recorded in the NCHS dataset with eight unique ICD codes. DRF visits requiring both opioid and non-opioid prescriptions increased over time. Patients aged less than 15 years and 45-64 years comprised the first- and second-highest number of visits, respectively, and the latter group was significantly more likely to receive an opioid prescription than any other age group (p &lt; 0.05). Rate of opioid prescriptions also correlated with patients&rsquo; expected payment source: patients utilizing workers&rsquo; compensation were significantly less likely to be prescribed opioid medications, while patients receiving services free of charge were significantly more likely to be prescribed opioid medications (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, ethnicity and geographic region were not found to correlate with rates of opioid prescription.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Prescriptions of analgesic medications for DRF, including both opioid and non-opioid derivatives, have been steadily increasing over time for patients in all demographics, with middle-aged adults most likely to receive an opioid prescription. Opioid prescription rates differ significantly between patients utilizing workers&rsquo; compensation and patients receiving services free of charge, suggesting that socioeconomic factors play a role in prescribing patterns.

Flap and nipple-areolar necrosis remain the most common complications. We aimed to assess which patient and surgical factors are associated with increased rates of necrosis after these procedures.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A single-institution retrospective cohort study was performed on patients who underwent NSM with DIEP reconstruction from January 2015 &ndash; June 2021. 64 distinct variables were analyzed, including patient and tumor characteristics, surgical factors, and complication rates. Patients were grouped by necrosis status into three groups: no necrosis, superficial necrosis, and deep necrosis. Comparative and descriptive statistics were performed via t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-squared tests.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The final cohort consisted of 25 women with a total of 26 breast cancers. One patient underwent prophylactic mastectomies and the remaining underwent surgery for breast cancer treatment. Most patients were white (88%) and had invasive ductal carcinoma (92%). Median age was 51 years with a median BMI of 26.41 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. No patients were current smokers but 5 (20%) had a previous smoking history.

Sixteen patients (64%) experienced necrosis: 11 with deep and 5 with superficial necrosis. No patient demographic factors were associated with necrosis. Patients with multicentric breast cancer (16%) had higher rates of flap necrosis (100% compared to 59%, p=0.003). Post-operative infection requiring antibiotic therapy occurred in 5 patients (25%) but was not associated with flap necrosis.

Four patients underwent delayed DIEP reconstruction (initial tissue expander placement followed by bilateral DIEP reconstruction delayed by at least 2 weeks). In the delayed group, there was a notable difference in operative time of DIEP procedure when comparing patients that developed deep necrosis (n=3) vs no necrosis (n=1) (mean time of 509 minutes vs 232 minutes).

Overall 30-day readmission rate for the entire cohort was 44% with 73% of these admissions secondary to deep necrosis, which was expectantly more frequent compared to those with superficial or no necrosis (p=0.037).

 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In patients undergoing NSM with DIEP reconstruction, those with multicentric disease appear to have higher rates of necrosis. Surgeons should aim to optimize operative efficiency to reduce operative duration for patients undergoing NSM with delayed DIEP reconstruction. Given the low number of patients who underwent a delayed reconstruction, we will continue prospective data collection to assess if implementing a delayed approach is effective in reducing necrosis rates.

Myers<sup>1, 2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>The Children's Hospital Of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Pediatric cranial defects can be congenital or acquired, some of which require surgical intervention primarily via cranioplasty. Cranioplasties following decompressive craniotomies are commonly performed in both pediatric and adult populations using either autologous bone or alloplastic implants, both of which have been deemed safe standards of practice. In addition, cases preceded by prior infection, radiation therapy, failed prior cranioplasty, or CSF leak can lead to a complex reconstructive environment. While there is a variety of studies investigating outcomes in the adult population there is a paucity of studies specific to the pediatric population. However, additional considerations and precautions must be taken in pediatric populations due to the continued growth, and variable thickness of the skull, and ongoing developing anatomy.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate differences in outcomes between pediatric patients with hostile reconstructive environments within their neurocranium who received split-calvarial autologous grafts as opposed to prosthetic grafts using titanium, acrylics, or plastic.



<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed an IRB-approved retrospective chart review of patients under the age of 18 who underwent either a split-thickness autologous cranioplasty or an alloplastic cranioplasty with a hostile setting between 1998 and 2020 at a tertiary children&rsquo;s referral center. Patients where then stratified into alloplastic and autologous groups based on the type of cranioplasty performed. Cranioplasties utilizing split-calvarial grafts were performed in collaboration between the neurosurgery and craniofacial departments, whereas cranioplasties utilizing prosthetic implants were performed exclusively by the neurosurgery department. The primary outcomes measured were hardware malfunction, post-operative complication during hospital stay, and complication after hospital stay. Statistical analysis included t-tests and chi-square tests using SPSS.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 51 pediatric patients who received a cranioplasty, 23 of which received an alloplastic implant whereas the other 28 received an autologous split-thickness graft. There were no significant differences in age, gender, type of hostile setting, etiology of cranial defect, or side of the cranial defect between the two groups. There were no significant differences in complications, defined as infection, failure or resorption of the graft, wound breakdown or necrosis, resulting bone defect, or hematoma, between the two populations. However, there was a statistically significant difference in gender between patients with complications. Within the subgroup of patients with complications, they were much more likely to be male: 90% as compared to 10% (p=0.035).


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In our study, there was no statistical difference observed in complications between alloplastic and split-thickness autologous grafts in pediatric patients with hostile settings. It does, however, appear that male patients are more likely to face complications as a result of cranioplasty. At our institution, we will be investigating whether other patient factors contributed to this discrepancy.

These reconstructions are complex owing to an older population with increased co-morbidities, complications of previous treatments and consequent intra-operative challenges. Whilst it is well-established that salvage autologous free-flap reconstruction addresses the symptoms of failed prosthetic reconstructions (pain and firmness from severe capsular contractures) and subjectively improves cosmesis, there has been no objective analysis of this aesthetic improvement published in the literature. The Breast Cancer Conservation Therapy cosmetic results (BCCT.core) software was initially developed to assess the cosmetic outcomes of lumpectomies but is now applied to post-mastectomy reconstructions. A prospective study of objective aesthetic outcomes following salvage reconstruction was undertaken using the BCCT.core software. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patient demographics, operative details and outcomes were collected for ten consecutive patients undergoing autologous free-flap salvage of their failed prosthetic reconstruction by a single operator from February 2018 to July 2020 at a tertiary referral hospital. Pre- and 9-12 months post-operative front-facing photographs were taken professionally and were objectively analyzed using the BCCT.core software. A 4-point Likert scale score, based on symmetry/colour/scar visibility and an overall aesthetic score (excellent/good/fair/poor) were generated. This was compared to a panel of three plastic surgeons&rsquo; subjective score of the same images as well as the patients&rsquo; own assessment. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Ten patients underwent 14 free-flap salvage reconstructions of 12 breasts (six unilateral, two bilateral and two bi-pedicled flaps to reconstruct one breast). Patient age was 57&plusmn;9.8 years with BMI of 26.74&plusmn;1.67kg/m<sup>2</sup>. 9/10 had prior chest-wall radiotherapy. Subjective indications included pain (9/10) and poor cosmesis. Severe capsular contracture (Baker III/IV) was the chief objective indication for salvage surgery. The deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap was used in 8/14 flaps. All flap transfers were successful with no total/partial flap loss. Subjective outcomes improved in all patients as assessed by the panel and the patients. Objective outcomes using BCCT.core showed dramatic improvement from poor to excellent post-operatively in 4 patients and one patient improved from poor to fair and another from good to excellent. The remaining 4 patients improved from fair to good . Notably, all patients experienced relieve of pain post-operatively.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study substantiates the widely held perception that salvage reconstruction with autologous free-flap tissue, as well as relieving symptoms, objectively improves the cosmetic outcomes of failed prosthetic reconstruction.

Currently, there is lack of data regarding intraoperative and postoperative pain control for this at risk population. Pectoralis nerve (Pecs) blocks have shown to be effective in oncologic breast reduction procedures, but their role is unclear in gender affirmation breast surgery. We aim to study the effects of the Pecs I and II regional nerve blocks in patients undergoing masculinizing mastectomy.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is in progress. Patients undergoing bilateral gender affirmation double incision mastectomy by a single surgeon are randomized to receive a bilateral ultrasound guided Pecs block with Ropivacaine or to receive a placebo injection (saline). The patient, surgeon, and anesthesia team in the case are blinded to the randomization. Intraoperative and postoperative opioid requirements are compared, as well as subjective pain scores at set postoperative time points. The primary outcome is the patient&rsquo;s pain score (Numerical Rating Scale). The secondary outcome is opioid consumption, which is reflected as Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) for ease of comparison. Pain scores are collected at set time points: 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours post op, as well as a daily average on postoperative days 1 through 7.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 16 patients have been enrolled between July, 2020 and December, 2020. Nine have been randomized to the intervention group, and seven to the control group. There has been no difference in intraoperative MME between the Pecs block group and control (10.0 vs. 9.2, p=0.55). Additionally, there is no difference in postoperative MME between the Pecs block group and control (34.2 vs. 30.2, p=0.37). The reported pain score at 6 hours post procedure is lower in the Pecs block group when compared to the control group (2.1 vs. 3.9, p=0.018). Similarly, the averaged pain score at postoperative day 1 is lower in the Pecs block group (3.0 vs. 4.3, p=0.03). None of the other time points have statistically significant differences in pain scores.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: To date, in patients undergoing bilateral gender affirmation mastectomy, there has been no difference in intraoperative or postoperative opioid consumption in patients receiving a Pecs block when compared to placebo. While there are lower reported pain scores in the Pecs block group at 2 postoperative time points (6 hours and POD 1), this is not consistent with reported scores at prior or subsequent time points. A major limitation thus far is sample size. This is an ongoing trial and as more results become available, additional conclusions may be drawn.

Radial nerve palsy causes debilitating effects including loss of elbow extension, wrist drop and loss of finger extension. Reparative surgical pathways range from primary repair and neurolysis, to nerve grafting, nerve transfers and tendon transfers. Tendon transfer is considered the gold standard because of ease of performance and acceptability and reproducibility of acceptable outcomes. However, independent finger function cannot be achieved and as such may not give truly desirable results. In lower-middle income countries (LMICs), the debate surrounding nerve transfer versus tendon transfer remains a point of contention, as the functional loss in tendon transfer is often considered devastating for fine hand function due to loss of grip secondary to lack of wrist and finger extension. In this study, we therefore present our experience of performing median nerve transfers for radial nerve palsy in Pakistan


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective case-series-in-review, of patients undergoing median to radial nerve transfer for radial nerve palsy over a period of six years from 2012-2019. Patients were identified via electromyography and nerve conduction studies. The procedure involved co-apting the branches of flexor carpi radialis and flexor digitorum superficialis (long and ring finger) to posterior interosseous nerve and extensor carpi radialis brevis respectively. Patients were assessed on MRC scale for muscle strength of wrist, finger and thumb extension separately at one year&rsquo;s time. Our results were then compared to results from similar nerve transfer studies.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We operated on 10 right-hand dominant patients, 8 males and 2 females with a median age of 33 years (6-63 years). 4 sustained injury to the right hand and 6 to the left. Causes of the injuries included road traffic accident (n=3), firearm injury (n=4), shrapnel (n=1), iatrogenic injury (injection in deltoid region (n=1)) and fall (n=1). Types of fracture included mid humerus fracture, fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus, and supracondylar fracture of the humerus. Median time to surgery since injury was 4 months (1-8months). Independent wrist extension was M4+ in all patients and independent finger extension was M4+ in seven and M4- in two patients. However, a patient who presented late at 8 months had poorer finger outcomes with extension at M2-. All patients had independent movement of fingers.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Nerve transfer is a reliable method of post traumatic nerve repair and reinnervation, particular in LMICs, even in cases where the nerve damage is severe and extensive and considerable time has elapsed between injury and presentation. Timely median to radial nerve transfer is a highly recommended option for radial nerve palsy, with regular follow-ups and physical therapy added to ensure positive outcomes.

Surgical training relies on technical experience gained in the operating room and, therefore, trainees were susceptible to loss of in-person learning opportunities during the pandemic. However, our cancer center only experienced a mild, temporary decrease in operative volume. Thus, we felt our learning environment could provide insight into a post-pandemic model of education. We evaluated the perceived impact of telemedicine and virtual learning on surgical fellowship training at a standalone Cancer Center.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An electronic survey was distributed to faculty (FAC) (n=34) and fellows (FELL) (n=18) within the complex surgical oncology, breast surgical oncology, urologic oncology and gynecologic oncology programs. The survey consisted of 39 questions within 4 categories (clinical training, didactics, multidisciplinary conferences and wellness). The views amongst all participants and differences between faculty and fellows were analyzed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall survey response rate was 82.6% (FAC 88.2%, FELL 72.2%). Most respondents felt the pandemic had minimal impact on operative cases (86.1% little/no impact). Engagement in virtual didactics increased significantly from pre-pandemic participation of 4.6% to 88.3% during the pandemic (p&lt;0.01). FAC found virtual learning to be more convenient compared to FELL (more convenient &ndash; 80% FAC vs 53.8% FELL, p=0.05). Both groups felt virtual didactics negatively impacted FELL learning (46.5%), and 65% indicated they often or always multi-tasked during educational sessions. Most found virtual multidisciplinary conferences more convenient (FAC 80.0%, FELL 69.2%) and wanted to continue meeting virtually (55.8%). Likelihood of multidisciplinary conference participation was higher for FAC compared to FELL (more likely to attend &ndash; FAC 66.7% vs FELL 38.3%, p=0.05). Overall, there was a minimal negative impact on wellness (11% negatively impacted). Most believe virtual learning platforms will continue (88.4%) and virtual visits will increase (66.7%) in the post-pandemic setting. Clinical telemedicine had the lowest perceived educational value (16.7% satisfied) compared to multidisciplinary conferences (47.6%, p &lt;0.05) and didactic sessions (55.8%, p&lt;0.05).

<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: We present a useful template for the incorporation of virtual platforms for surgical fellow education as our case volumes were minimally impacted by the pandemic. Our data suggest that the convenience of virtual meetings will lead to their continued adoption. However, it appears that more educational didactic activities are preferred in person, while administrative meetings such as multi-disciplinary conferences are more suited to virtual platforms. We believe that a future hybrid model of surgical education will blend the convenience of virtual interactions with the improved satisfaction of in-person learning.

Shim<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;<sup>3</sup>University Of Wisconsin, Division Of Education, Department Of Surgery, Madison, WI, USA&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>Bassett Healthcare, Department Of General Surgery, Cooperstown, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 

Surgeons have a unique opportunity for leadership, leading teams within the operating room, trauma bay, or surgical intensive care unit. However, though leaderships skills are expected at the start of a surgeon&rsquo;s practice, formal leadership training has not historically been included in residency curricula. Thus, a focus on the need for this training during residency has increased, and multiple approaches have been incorporated. However, rural surgeons face unique challenges, and no organized curriculum has been developed to address the specific leadership skills needed. With 60 million Americans living in rural areas and only 8% of the general surgeon workforce practicing in these communities, many of whom will soon retire, rural surgery leadership training may prove critical in providing care to these communities. The goal of this study was to characterize the leadership development experiences and perceived needs for skills development of residents in a rural general surgery program.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

A one-hour focus group was conducted, recorded and transcribed. Participants included 14 surgical residents ranging in PGY1 to PGY5 at a rural general surgery residency program. Topics included prior leadership training, skills and qualities specific to rural surgery leadership, and ways leadership can improve equality within rural surgery. A thematic analysis was then performed.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Three participants had attended the ACS Residents as Teachers and Leaders conference. No participants reported receiving any other formal leadership training during residency. Due to limited resources and personnel in rural settings as well as the often greater perceived role of physicians within rural communities, skills and qualities that the participants found important in rural leadership were emotional intelligence, empathy, an attitude of service, the ability to work strategically with care and creativity, developing capability, having a broad and flexible skill set, relationship building and community integration, patient advocacy, and engaging the team while inspiring a shared purpose. These skills are important because rural surgery is personal. Rural surgeons know their patients living in a community and their practice affords no anonymity or objectivity.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Awareness has recently grown regarding the importance of leadership development in residency. In this focus group of rural surgical residents, the development of leadership skills was universally valued with a particular focus on those that confront the challenges practitioners in rural environments face. It also highlights the importance of leadership training in rural surgery programs. With this information, we can develop an interventional arm to create intentional curriculum to address this need. Further research should be completed to assess whether leadership training helps prepare residents for these unique challenges and helps lower attrition rates of rural surgeons.

It is well understood that surgical entrustment leading to gradually increasing operative autonomy is critical in the progression of residents towards independent practice. Much of what we know about entrustment focuses on faculty behaviors as primary drivers leading to increases or decreases in operative opportunities. However, less is known about early trainee experiences with entrustment and what role it may play in resident occupational fulfillment. As such, we report on emergent results from trainees who described high levels of entrustment in the operating room. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
The data for this study is part of a year-long qualitative investigation exploring surgical intern experiences. We interviewed 24 surgical interns from 7 institutions and 7 surgical subspecialties in one state. Data from this study represents the second of three interviews conducted at the six-month point during the intern year. Interviews were analyzed and reported following thematic analysis. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
Participants described emotional responses and outcomes from their first experiences in the operating room where they physically performed an operation themselves under supervision, a high level of entrustment. Most interns describe experiences with entrustment, however a few had minimal experiences at the sixth month mark reporting, &ldquo;I find [the OR] quite boring. I usually just stand there and watch other people do things.&rdquo; Most participants, however, report positive emotional and practical implications from the times they experienced high operative entrustment. These participants describe their encounters with excitement and zeal reporting, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s thrilling...It reminds me of why you&rsquo;re going through all the other stuff...&rdquo; Many participants report that high levels of entrustment increased occupational fulfillment, describing how instances of operating under supervision rather than observing shepherded them through the more challenging aspects of an intern&rsquo;s life, &ldquo;I would work late some days. I was like, that&rsquo;s fine. I took out someone&rsquo;s appendix.&rdquo; Interns often spoke to the reason they entered surgery as a way to positively impact the lives of patients. While interns recognize the importance and necessity of their role in clinically managing patients, they felt most connected to their identity as surgical trainees during instances of high operative entrustment compared to the clinical management of patients, particularly during CoVID-19. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
While entrustment in the operating room is influenced by multiple external factors including faculty familiarity, increasing entrustment has an expected positive effect on occupational fulfillment and decreasing burnout in the intern year. Because faculty are primarily responsible for entrustment it is essential to understand that increasing entrustment and steps towards surgical autonomy are positive pivotal moments of the intern year that transcend learning and impact overall trainee well-being.

Women are more likely to face unconscious biases such as lighter operative caseloads during surgical training. Female role models may promote cultural changes in surgical training programs to decrease gender bias, in part, by providing indispensable mentorship and leadership advice. This study determines the operative caseload and inclusion of women in surgical training over an 18-year period at a single institution.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of all categorical General Surgery residents and their operative caseloads upon graduation between 2002-2020 at a single institution was performed. The caseloads were stratified by major case subtype (e.g., abdominal, alimentary tract, breast, endocrine, etc.) and compared between female and male surgical residents each year. The total number of female residents prior to the appointment of a woman Chair of Surgery was compared to the total number of female residents in the subsequent 5 years.

 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: By 2020, a total of 25/119 (19%) female PGY-5 residents graduated. In 2015, the total number of female residents among categorical PGY-1 &ndash; PGY5 positions was 8/31 (26%) compared to the ACGME average of 38%. In 2021, there are currently 19/34 (56%) categorical PGY1-PGY5 women in the program compared to the 2019 ACGME reported percentage of female residents of 43%. In a 6-year period, there was a significant 138% increase of the number female general surgery residents. Over this study period, average total major caseloads have steadily increased with no significant difference between men and women.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Female General Surgery residents remained underrepresented at this institution until the appointment of a woman Chair of Surgery. Over this time, women did not experience lighter operative caseloads compared to men. Women may be more inclined to select programs with more female leadership due to the likelihood that greater gender diversity offers mentorship opportunities, challenges workplace discrimination, and provides a sense of equity.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We utilized an embedded mixed methods design to characterize the University of Michigan&rsquo;s (UM) surgical nursing perceptions of medical students. A 13-question Qualtrics survey was developed with Likert scale and verbal frequency scale sections and subsequently distributed via email to 256 UM surgical staff. The survey questions addressed teamwork in the OR and prior knowledge about training received by team members. A subset of participants were recruited to complete semi-structured interviews to further explore staff perspectives. Interview quotes were reported thematically.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Survey response rate was 13% (N=33) with 97% of respondents interacting almost daily with medical students. 97% of respondents agreed that teamwork is an important aspect of the medical student-nurse relationship; yet only 52% agreed that teamwork is emphasized as a big part of the medical student-nurse relationship at UM. 55% agreed with the statement &ldquo;I enjoy having medical students in the OR with the team.&rdquo; Yet only 13% felt that medical students had a good understanding of nurses&rsquo; role on the OR team, and 91% felt that medical students should be exposed to the surgical nursing profession before beginning OR rotations. While most (58%) nurses responded that they understand the role of the medical student in the OR, only 21% felt they had a good understanding of medical student education outside of the OR. Only 28% of nurses agreed that medical students are qualified to be involved in OR patient care, but the majority (55%) agreed with the statement &ldquo;I enjoy having medical students in the OR with the team&rdquo;. Similar sentiments were reflected during interview conversations regarding the dimensions of teamwork, preparation and interprofessional education (Table).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite an overall desire for teamwork, this study provides a new perspective on nurses&rsquo; perceptions of students in the OR, highlighting a general lack of knowledge of each other&#39;s roles. To improve team dynamics in the OR, concerted efforts should be made by both clerkship and nursing leadership to educate members on the benefits of medical students involved in OR patient care, surgical nursing&rsquo;s role in the OR team, and medical student education outside of the OR.

Varman<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: In medical education, there has been a shift from the typical passive didactic teaching methods to more interactive teaching methods that improve teamwork and problem-solving skills. Gaming has been used as an effective teaching method in a variety of applications including role play, board games, video games, and simulations. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a team-based Jeopardy-style review of head and neck anatomy.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A Jeopardy-style review was administered to first-year medical students who completed the head and neck block of anatomy to assess their understanding of the material. Students worked in teams to generate their answers, and a current resident in the head and neck surgery department was available to highlight the clinical context of the material. Upon completion of the activity, students completed an exit survey to evaluate their experience.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Analysis of survey responses from first-year medical students show that students were enthusiastic about the experience. More than 80% of all students who participated in the survey agreed that team-based learning made the experience less stressful and prefer it to an individual learning experience. All students who participated in the activity agreed that having a resident present at the event was highly valuable and helped them to understand the real-life surgical applications of what they learn in the classroom. Interestingly students also responded that Jeopardy-style learning showed them had difficulty with the recall of certain answers or felt &ldquo;tip of tongue&rdquo; syndrome highlighting the difference between recall and recognition with this style of learning.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The application of this Jeopardy-style game review was received positively by students and provided a fun and safe atmosphere where students felt comfortable to actively apply their knowledge of head and neck anatomy. This teaching method can be applied to a variety of topics in medical and surgical education to increase information retention in a collaborative environment. Having residents available at such events is also valued by students.

Arora<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Augusta University, Department Of Surgery, Augusta, GA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Resident performance on the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) is often used by General Surgery programs to assess surgical knowledge and identify residents at risk for failure for the qualifying examination. Additionally, fellowships use ABSITE scores to help stratify the multitude of applications they receive each academic year. We therefore sought to identify program specific gaps in surgical knowledge by analyzing aggregated ABSITE Score reports and altering the basic science curriculum accordingly.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: ABSITE performance reports include standard score, percent correct scores, percentiles and key word or topic incorrectly answered for seven specific subtests. The seven categories include abdomen (ABD), alimentary tract (ALI), breast/endocrine/soft tissue/head &amp; neck (BESH), surgical critical care/trauma (SCC), surgical specialties (SPEC), pre peri op care (PREOP) and general surgical knowledge (GS K). Nineteen ABSITE score reports for the PGY-1, 2 and 3 residents were de-identified, aggregated and analyzed to identify knowledge gaps.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Amongst the seven subtest of the 2019 ABSITE, the following topics were answered incorrectly: pancreatic pseudocyst (90%), pancreatectomy (83%), anorectal abscess (72%), benign breast inflammatory disease (80%), thyroidectomy (80%), sepsis (87%), components of immune system (73%), plastic surgery (97%), pleural effusion (93%), disorders of coagulation (73%), venous thromboembolism (87%) and perioperative assessment of pulmonary risk (87%). Preliminary results of ABSITE scores after curriculum initiation noted improvement in variation of scores amongst residents.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Needs analysis identified topics that majority of PGY-1, 2 and 3 residents answered incorrectly on the 2019 ABISTE. The incorrect topics correlated with gaps in surgical knowledge due to limited exposure to specific surgical specialties and rotations in the first three years of training at the institution. This data was used to alter the programs basic science curriculum tin an effort o address these knowledge gaps. This is a novel approach to structuring junior didactics and future analysis will be performed to assess delta change for incorrect topics.

Approximately 1/5 of the US population lives in rural areas, but only 10% of general surgeons and a minority of surgical trainees pursue rural practice. The lack of local surgical infrastructure in rural communities creates &ldquo;surgical deserts,&rdquo; leading to increased burdens on regional centers, delays in care, and poorer prognosis for patients. The aim of this study was to assess medical student perceptions of rural surgery and healthcare and elucidate factors which influence their decisions for future practice. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We administered an electronic survey to medical students enrolled in 11 medical training institutions in Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan. The survey was designed with guidance by literature review, evaluated by a survey content expert at Indiana University, and piloted amongst a group of students for readability and clarity of survey questions. Student and faculty liaisons at each institution disseminated the survey to all medical students. Survey collection took place from February-May 2021. Descriptive analysis of data was completed using STATA V16.1.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

Respondents included 700 medical students; 60% female with an equal distribution across medical school classes. Ninety-three percent of students believe we &ldquo;lack&rdquo; or &ldquo;are in great need of&rdquo; rural surgeons, and 43% believe the rural surgery field is declining. However, only 16% of students reported interest in &ldquo;pursuing a future career in a rural setting&rdquo; and 44% remained unsure. Only 36% of students reported any exposure to rural practice during medical school, with the overall median of exposures being 0 (range 0-4). Students with fewer exposures were significantly less likely to report a desire to pursue rural practice (p&lt;0.001). However, using binomial logistic regression, students with even one exposure had three-time greater odds of reporting a desire for rural practice (OR=3.13, p&lt;0.001) (Figure 1). Students exposed to a rural health interest group or rural scholarships demonstrated the strongest effect on interest in future rural practice (OR=32.3, p=0.006; OR=1041, p = 0.007; respectively). Exposures to clinical rotations or pre-clinical courses had no significant effect on interest in future rural practice. Lastly, nearly 50% of students from rural areas reported a desire to pursue a rural practice (OR=6.00, p&lt;0.001). 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

While students are unequivocally aware of the need for rural surgery and health, only 16% reported interest in pursuing a career in a rural setting. Exposures to rural health interest groups and scholarships positively correlated with desire for rural practice. However, the lack of positive correlation of clinical experiences warrants further investigation.

The Covid-19 pandemic changed medical education, with strategies supported by virtual platforms and non-conventional scenarios. An example of this is the morbidity and mortality meetings (M&amp;M). The objective of this study is to find the characteristics of virtual M&amp;M meetings in different institutions focused on general surgery resident&acute;s students in Colombia, and how medical residents and professors feel about them compared to the traditional face-to-face meetings. 
<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is an observational, and descriptive study in 21 hospital practice institutions of 17 General Surgery programs in Colombia, where virtual M&amp;M operate. Information was obtained on their objectives, operational characteristics and scope. Additionally, in self-completion surveys, the participants&#39; perception about the usefulness and operation was investigated, this, because of the shift to virtuality. There was participation of 82 residents and 65 professors from different postgraduate programs in General Surgery in the country. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Virtual M&amp;Ms continue in 53&thinsp;% of the practice sites, with a predominance in private institutions. There are differences in their organization, although the traditional M&amp;M model persists: objectives, structure, and scope. There is a longer duration of meetings, unconventional schedules and the perception of a reduced academic level. There is an improvement in the hostile environment, within the virtuality.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: M&amp;Ms have a place in a virtual scenario. Its operation is like face-to-face meetings, and its execution offers opportunities for improvement in terms of form and content.

Montagnese<sup>1</sup>, D. Soybel<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, White River Junction, VT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The graphic narrative medium has become increasingly popular in exploring medical events and themes. The goal of this study was to explore in such narratives the experience of surgical patients and/or their caregivers, by asking: 1) In what ways do graphic narratives portray the experience of the surgical patient that are not present in other mediums? 2) What aspects of the patient&rsquo;s surgical experience are conveyed through graphic novels that might otherwise be hidden from the surgeon? 3) How can the insights from graphic narratives be used by surgeons to improve care for their patients and their own professional development? 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified graphic narrative sources through a search executed on graphic medicine websites, online library curations, and social media platforms. Of 103 results that returned from this search, 31 sources with a key word &ldquo;surgery&rdquo; were identified. Each of the 31 sources were read by two researchers and analyzed according to rubrics of visual and literary themes, target audience, and intended impact. Two sources were further excluded due to little surgical substance.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-nine (29) graphic narratives were identified in which surgical events and themes were prominent. Surgical specialties represented in these graphic narratives included: Ear, Nose, &amp; Throat (2), Neurosurgery, (4), Obstetric (3), Gender-Affirming Surgery/ Plastic + Reconstructive Surgery (2), General/ Abdominal (11), Oral (2), Orthopedic (1), Cardiac (2), Urologic (1), and Unspecified (1). Countries of origin included: United States (16), Canada (1), England, UK (6), France (3), Germany (1), and Belgium (1). Author demographics were specified in 27: 14 identified as cisgender male, one identified as transgender male, 11 identified as cisgender female, and one identified as transgender male. Of the 27 authors, 9 had unspecified ages. Ages of the remaining 18 authors at the time of publication were between 30 and 65 years, the majority between 30 and 44. In our analysis, three dominant themes emerged. The first was that, in 23/29 narratives, surgery is viewed not as a final solution but in the context of the entire journey through illness and convalescence. Second, in 15 sources, the authors utilize this medium to process the life-changing consequences of illness, and ways in which surgery is meant to offset disability and to help the patient cope. Lastly, 22 sources provided descriptions of preparation pre-surgery and convalescence post-surgery which are otherwise not commonly discussed in other media or in face-to-face interactions.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The graphic narrative is an emerging form of communication by patients and their caregivers. Although biased by the nature of the authors, who, by definition, are both literary and artistically moved, such narratives offer windows into the experience of surgical patients that otherwise may not be addressed in standardized encounters and structured patient reported outcomes.

These changes were implemented over a short period of time and the effects on the applicant selection process are not well known. We seek to fill this gap by surveying the general surgery residency program directors to examine changes to their evaluations of applicants, and to gather information on how these changes will affect future application cycles.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study by distributing a 31-question email questionnaire through the Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) listserv during the month of June 2021. The syrvey included responses from general surgery residency program directors and associate program directors. Survey responses were tabulated and analyzed using descriptive statistics. 


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total 42 participants (27 program directors, 15 associate program directors) correspoing to 10% response rate completed the survey from 25 (60%) academic, 9 (21%) community and 8 (19%) hybrid programs. When asked about the away rotations conducted, 36 (86%) are offering in-person away rotations only, 3 (7%) offering both virtual and in-person and 3 (7%) are not offering away rotations at all. Due to the COVID restrictions, 11 programs reported that they reduced the number of away rotations offered. When asked about changes to the interview format in the 2021-2022 application cycle compared to the prior years, 17 (41%) programs reported that they will offer both in-person and virtual interviews, 8 (19%) will offer in-person only and 15 (36%) will offer virtual only. Twenty-two (52%) statied that they anticipate the continued use of the virtual platform for interviews in the future cycles. As far as how much does that change affect the importance of the interview compared to other factors, the majority, 24 programs (57%), stated that no changes on how much it weighs compared to prior cycles, 3 (7%) programs will add more emphasis on interview and 2 (5%) programs with less emphasis on interviews compared to before. Finally, when asked about other factors considered when assessing applicants for interviews, responses remain similar to that reported by studies pre-pandemic, with the highest emphasis on board scores, letters of recommendation from surgeons, personal statement, leadership qualities, evaluations/grades in clinical rotations and perceived commitment to general surgery. 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to noteworthy changes in the residency application processes. We report a shift in preference to virtual interviews, a change that is likely to persist in future application cycles. Criteria for interview selection remain similar to pre-pandemic reports.

Srinivasan<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Emory Univesity School of Medicine, Department Of Surgery, Atlanta, GA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Assessment of surgical resident technical performance is an integral component of any surgical training program. Timely assessment delivered in a structured format is a critical step to sharpen technical skills, but residents often report that the quality and quantity of feedback received is lacking. We therefore planned and implemented a web-based Intraoperative Assessment tool and corresponding summary &quot;dashboard&quot; to facilitate real-time technical performance assessment.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A web form was designed leveraging a cloud computing platform and implementing a modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) instrument; this included additional, procedure-specific criteria for select operations. A link to this was provided to residents via email and to faculty as a Quick Response (QR) code. Residents open and complete a portion of the form on a smartphone, then relinquish the device to an attending surgeon who then completes and submits the Assessment. The data are then transferred to a secure web-based reporting interface; each resident (together with a faculty advisor) can then access and review all of his or her assessments (Figure 1).


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The Assessment form was activated in June 2021 and formally announced to all residents at our general surgery residency program at the beginning of July with residents required to complete at least one assessment per month. To date a total of 62 assessments have been completed for operations performed by 31 trainees supervised by 23 surgical faculty. The median number of procedures assessed per resident was 1 (range: 1-19) and the median number of assessments per faculty member was also 1 (range 1-17). Most residents evaluated were in their fourth or fifth year of training (n=32). Resident initiation of Intraoperative Assessments has steadily increased since the tool was introduced with larger increases at the start of new clinical rotations and feedback received by the residency program has been positive.


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This novel system demonstrates that an online, resident-initiated technical assessment tool is feasible to implement and scale. This model&#39;s requirement that the attending enter performance ratings into the trainee&#39;s electronic device ensures that feedback is delivered directly to the trainee. Whether this aspect of our assessment ensures more direct and specific (and therefore potentially actionable) feedback is a focus for future study. Our use of commercial cloud computing services should permit cost-effective adoption of similar systems at other training programs.

Moorman<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University Hospitials, Trauma, Critical Care, And Acute Carer Surgery/Surgery, Cleveland, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
The Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit at Cleveland Medical Center is a 20 bed ICU that treats over 2000 critically ill patients per year. Experienced and specialty trained nurses are essential to the delivery of high-quality care. In 2020 our unit filled all open nursing positions, many with recently graduated nurses. To prepare the new nurses and to integrate them with the existing team, we created a focused code blue education curriculum to supplement the required ACLS/BLS certification. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
Using the roles of a code blue as content, we created a seven-week curriculum of microteaching sessions with targeted delivery in less than 15 minutes. The curriculum ended with a mock code blue run by participants. Participants completed a pretest and posttest ranking personal comfort level and perceived team performance performing each task. Paired values were analyzed with Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and unpaired values were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U Test.


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
26/40 (65%) of participants completed both a pretest and posttest. After the curriculum, composite average of comfort level rank increased (p = .0001). Participant&rsquo;s perception of team performance in a code improved for Med-box/Reconstitution of medications (p = .0032), Document events of a code (p = .0236), and Communication (p = .0033); overall composite average of perception rank increased (p = &lt;.0001). In subgroup analysis, the inexperienced subgroup began the course less comfortable performing Med-box/Reconstitution of medication (p = .0375), Assign roles (p= .0135), and communication (p= .0147), with an overall lower composite average of personal comfort rank (p = &lt;.0001). The inexperienced subgroup had resolution of all individual role rank discrepancies after the curriculum. The experienced subgroup improved comfort rank for intervention with shock (p = .0369) only. Composite average of personal comfort level rank did not change between the pretest and posttest in the experienced subgroup. The experienced subgroup had improvement in perception of team performance in chest compressions (p = .0369), interpreting EKG&rsquo;s (p = .0418), and communication (p = .0126), with an overall improvement in perception rank across roles (p = &lt;.0001). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:
The curriculum was beneficial for both inexperienced and experienced subgroups. Inexperienced participants improved personal comfort rank performing roles in a code blue and improved perception of team performance in a code blue with the curriculum. Experienced participants had minimal improvement in personal comfort rank, but had improved perception of team performance in a code blue.

Klug<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>University of Tennessee Health Science Center, General Surgery, Memphis, TN, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>University of North Carolina At Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Ergonomics is the study of how humans and machines interact. With its study and importance growing in scope following the invention of the assembly line by Henry Ford in 1913, ergonomics and considerations to be made regarding optimal workplace efficiency have moved into the modern-day operating room. Often found in prolonged, fixed positions and performing strenuous, repetitive motions, surgeons can experience an increased intensity in pain at the end of their careers. With this pain and decline in overall quality of life, surgeons are also arguably at an increased risk of committing surgical errors prior to retirement, thus putting patients and their safety in jeopardy. Pediatric surgeons appear particularly susceptible to task-related physical discomfort, and incorporation of ergonomic principles should be considered. Based off of physician testimonials and experience, as well as analysis of previously printed literature on ergonomics, our objective is to make recommendations that help prolong the career and quality of life for Pediatric surgeons.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Literature review, using &ldquo;ergonomics and pediatric surgery&rdquo; as a key word search, and compilation and analysis of polled, local physician testimonials.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 77% of the polled Pediatric surgeons in practice for at least 10 years admitted to having experienced physical pain at some point in their careers. Reasons cited included restricted freedom of movement, limited peripheral vision, and decreased tactile feedback. Based off of these cited causes of pain, we created six primary areas for consideration regarding ergonomics in the operating room, including monitor positioning, specifically in terms of impact on the neck and eyes, upper extremity, trunk, and lower extremity positioning. The number of foot pedals and shape of instruments were also considered.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We recommend that the monitor be placed one meter away from the surgeon, just below eye level or at 0-15 degrees from natural gaze. The neck should be held neutral or mildly flexed to 5-9 degrees. The shoulders should be relaxed, and the arms should be held close to the body, slightly extended or adducted. The elbows should be relaxed and the operating hand should be 2.5 cm above or 12.5 cm below the elbow depending on the table height. The elbow should be supported while operating as well. The wrist should be in a neutral position while operating and not flexed. If possible, we recommend sitting in a &ldquo;perched&rdquo; position, which has the befits of both sitting and standing. We believe it&rsquo;s important to limit the number of foot pedals, as well as to distribute the force across multiple fingers while using hand instruments. Use of the flexor muscles while operating is also important. Finally, loupes should not be used while performing endoscopic surgery, and the table height should always be considered.

Thoracic surgery residency webpages help applicants determine where they apply and/or accept an interview. However, there is no standardized manner in which relevant information from programs is communicated. We studied what information applicants prioritize in assessing programs through their websites and analyzed the presence of this content. 

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 

We used FREIDA Online to identify residency programs with traditional fellowships. Program related variables included presence or absence of tracks, track duration, annual cardiac and thoracic cases, education curriculum, research, robotic, endoscopy, interventional pulmonology, and endovascular procedure opportunities. Fellow related variables included number of resident(s) a program accepts, case numbers per resident, the fellows/faculty displayed, and the presence of I-6 and 3/4 tracks. Website analysis was done by two independent reviewers. Current cardiothoracic and general surgery residents were asked to rate how important (from extremely important to not important at all) the presence of these variables in program websites. 

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:

71 programs were analyzed and 21 residents filled out the survey. 81% male, 48% interested in academic practice, and 57% are pursuing a career in adult cardiac surgery. Only 24 program websites (34%) mentioned having a cardiac and/or general thoracic track while 67% of residents considered it extremely or very important. 31% reported annual program cases performed and14% reported number of cases performed per resident, values which were considered extremely or very important by 67% and 62% of residents, respectively. Program websites are lacking information on curriculum (11%), research (8%), robotic (58%), transplant (59%) or endovascular (35%) content that were considered extremely or very important by 81% of residents. Residents and faculty displayed on websites were considered extremely or very important by 57% and 81% despite being reported only by 64% and 77%, respectively. A quarter of residents surveyed were dissatisfied with the overall information provided by program websites. 

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Thoracic residency program websites lack crucial content that is deemed extremely or very important by applicants. This study suggests the possible need for either a single comprehensive data repository or a standardized method for communicating information via program websites.

While previous research has determined that tweeted cardiothoracic (CT) surgery articles receive more citations, academic CT surgeons with a social media presence have not previously been characterized. We hypothesized that academic CT surgeons active on Twitter would represent a young, highly academically productive cohort of surgeons.

<strong>Methods</strong>: We created a database of academic CT surgeons (n=1065) at all 79 accredited training institutions in the U.S. in 2020. Surgeon-specific data on professional history, research productivity, National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant funding, and social media activity were obtained from publicly available sources such as institutional webpages, Scopus, Grantome, and Twitter. Data regarding 2020 NIH institution funding were obtained through the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools. Because of non-normal distribution, continuous data are presented as median with interquartile range and analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical data are analyzed with Fisher exact test or the chi-square test.

<strong>Results</strong>: 265 (24.9%) CT surgeons had a Twitter account in 2020 while 800 (75.1%) did not. Surgeons active on Twitter started their account 5.0 [2.0-8.0] years ago, have 164.0 [27.0-509.0] followers, and were following 108.0 [27.0-295.0] accounts. Surgeons active on Twitter were also more likely to be women (14.7% vs 9.3%, p=0.0154), to have obtained a Master&rsquo;s or PhD degree (30.6% vs 23.3%, p=0.0219), and to be thoracic surgeons (38.1% vs 30.1%, p=0.0045). Surgeons with Twitter activity more recently entered practice, having been attendings for fewer years (11.0 vs 16.0, p&lt;0.0001) compared to surgeons without Twitter activity (Table). Nonetheless, surgeons active on Twitter required a fewer number of years from starting as an attending to become an associate professor (6.0 vs 7.0, p=0.0114) and full professor (12.0 vs 13.0, p=0.0870). Regarding research productivity, surgeons with Twitter activity published more first- and last-author papers per year (1.9 vs 0.8, p&lt;0.0001) and more total papers per year (6.0 vs 3.1, p&lt;0.0001) as an attending. Both groups of surgeons were as likely to have received NIH grant funding (17.4% vs 17.1%, p=0.9253) and to currently practice at a top-10 NIH-funded institution (18.5% vs 18.5%, p&gt;0.9999).

<strong>Conclusions</strong>: Academic CT surgeons active on Twitter represent a young, academically productive, and more gender-diverse cohort. These surgeons may demonstrate the utility of a social media presence in building a broader network and amplifying research, providing a model for the future of academic surgery.","Education","Resident Education","Cardiothoracic"

However, applicant selection is heavily influenced by the very subjective face-to-face interview process. In an attempt to objectify personality compatibility, emphasized in a virtual format, we added personality traits testing to the process. This report summarizes our incorporation of Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality evaluation into our pediatric surgical fellow selection process.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All applicants selected for an in-person interview for the 2020 Pediatric Surgery Match were administered the BFI questionnaire, which was scored by a non-voting member of the selection committee. A ranking spreadsheet was created with scores assigned to academic productivity, in-service examination performance, standardized letters of reference strength, laparoscopic skills performance, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) status and interview scores. The initial rank order list (ROL) was created in descending order of cumulative score. The ROL was restructured by input from the selection committee after addition of BFI data. Correlation of specific BFI personality characteristics (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) was assessed with the initial position on the ROL and change in position on the reformulated ROL.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Thirty-four applicants were interviewed and 24(70.6%) were ranked. Linear regression analysis identified a lower neuroticism score to be directly related with position on the initial ROL {r(22)=0.4626, P=0.0228}. No statistically significant associations were identified with extroversion (p=0.37), agreeableness (p=0.75), conscientiousness (p=0.14), and openness (p=0.21) traits. Similar analysis of the reformulated ROL identified a higher conscientiousness score {r(22)=0.5331;p=0.007} and a lower neuroticism score {r(22)=-0.4383;(p=0.03)} to have a significant correlation with an ascending change on the final ROL (Figure 1).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The self-administered BFI adds objectivity to personality determination gleaned from the standard face-to-face interview. Neuroticism score had a significant impact on the position of an applicant on the initial ROL, even when blinded to the BFI data. When BFI data was made available, other personality traits were noted to have a significant impact on the final ROL. Objective personality data may therefore serve as an aid in this difficult process, and help interviewers overcome their innate biases and potential misinterpretations of human behavior.

The knowledge gap and heterogeneity of nursing experience in the perioperative care of surgical neonates can lead to preventable complications. Standardized clinical protocols can help minimize these patient safety events, but cannot replace clinical judgment which relies on a high level of knowledge to execute. We aim to assess the effect of an educational course given by the surgical team on the comfort level and ability of nursing providers in the Intensive Care Nursery/ Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (ICN/NICU) to identify and care for patients with EA/TEF.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A 3-hour virtual course was taught by a team of pediatric surgeons, surgical advanced practice providers, an occupational therapist, and a dietitian. The target audience was nurses and nurse practitioners in the ICN/NICU at a single quaternary care children&rsquo;s hospital. Pre-and post-course and 8-month follow-up surveys included multiple-choice questions to assess knowledge in the following domains of anatomy, surgical repair, and postoperative management. A dependent one-tail T-Test was then used to measure the difference between pre- and post-course test scores as well as pre-course and follow-up test scores.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 32 of the 39 participants completed the pre-and post-course test surveys and 11 of the 32 original attendees completed the 8-month follow-up survey. Knowledge and comfort levels were assessed with a pre-and post-course test format (maximum score of 100%). The participants demonstrated statistically significant higher post-course score (average of 70% [SD 9%]; p &lt; 0.05) and 8-month follow-up test scores (average of 63% [SD 10%]; p &lt; 0.05) compared to the pre-course score (average score of 49% [SD 4%]). Similarly, participants reported a significant increase in their comfort level caring for EA/TEF patients based on 5-point Likert scale with (1) strongly agree to (5) strongly disagree (average pre-course 2.06 [SD 0.98] vs average post-course 1.28 [SD 0.52]; p &lt; 0.05 and vs average follow up 1.63 [SD 0.50]; p &lt; 0.05). All participants after the course endorsed they had gained clinical knowledge that they would use to care for future EA/TEF patients. In the follow-up survey, all participants who had taken care of TEF/EA patients after the course (N=6) agreed that knowledge gained from the course allowed them to provide better care for their patients.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The results of this study support that a targeted course for frontline nursing providers positively affects comfort level and knowledge, which remains true even 8 months later. Knowledge retention may benefit from a short interval refresher course. A virtual platform allowed the course to be recorded, which can facilitate wider distribution and also be a resource for re-education. This study also highlights the role of surgeons in cross-disciplinary education.

This is especially true for rare but lifesaving procedures, such as emergent cricothyrotomy. Videos are convenient, readily available on most phones, and offer the learner the realities and intricacies of performing that procedure. YouTube is the most popular of these resources. While it is free and easy to access, there are no standards for uploading procedural videos. Without standards or verification, the accuracy and quality of these educational videos remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the quality of cricothyrotomy videos available on YouTube through an expert panel of surgeons with objective quality metrics.


<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We surveyed an expert panel of surgical faculty at our urban academic Level 1 trauma center for quality assessment of surgical procedural videos. A YouTube search for &ldquo;emergency cricothyrotomy&rdquo; was performed and the resulting videos were filtered to remove animations, lectures, and irrelevant procedures. The videos also had to demonstrate the procedure on a live patient, cadaver, or realistic model. Videos were then sorted by view count and the top four videos were sent to a panel of surgical attendings for evaluation. An educational quality (EQ) score was generated from a 7-point Likert scale for the chosen videos, which was used to assess the following metrics: identification of procedural indications, anatomical structures, instruments used, and critical maneuvers. Video narration, orientation to patient, viewing clarity, and the presence of safety concerns were evaluated in the same way. A free-response field was also included, to allow reviewers to share their overall impressions of the video. The educational quality of each video was assessed with an EQ score


<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the seven surgical attendings who were invited to participate, four completed the survey. The median EQ score was 6 on a 7-point scale (95%CI &plusmn; 0.3). All but one of the individual qualities had a median EQ score of 6 (95%CI: indications= &plusmn; 1.2, anatomy= &plusmn; 1.0, instruments= &plusmn; 0.5, critical maneuvers= &plusmn; 0.8, narration= &plusmn; 0.4, orientation= &plusmn; 0.6, clarity= &plusmn; 0.6). A crucial exception was the safety measurement, which only had an EQ score of 5.5 (95%CI &plusmn; 1.2). The most variability in median was noted in EQ score regarding the video&rsquo;s ability to properly explain the indications for the procedure (95%CI &plusmn; 1.2). 


<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Overall, the most-viewed online cricothyrotomy videos were given positive ratings by trauma surgeons at our institution, but safety of procedures was deemed of less quality. There is a need for surgical societies to create and disseminate high-quality, efficient and easily accessible videos. Additional studies are needed to determine if medical learners are able to distinguish between high and low quality videos.

Pugh<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Stanford University, Surgery, Palo Alto, CA, USA&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>Stanford University, Cardiothoracic, Palo Alto, CA, USA&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>VA Palo Alto Healthcare Systems, Surgery, Palo Alto, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown promise in facilitating surgical video review by automatic recognition of surgical activities/events. However, training AI algorithms require large amounts of surgical video for each category of surgical activity. This requirement limits the application of these algorithms for recognizing rare occurrences (such as intraoperative complications) where there are not enough AI training samples available. In this study, we focus on video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy where case series report rates of 2.9% to 8.3% for major intraoperative bleeding. There are few public video data sources available that demonstrate this critical event which is insufficient to train AI for reliable video event recognition. We hypothesize that a generative AI algorithm can create artificial massive bleeding images for VATS lobectomy that can be used to augment the current lack of data in this field.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
To generate artificial massive bleeding event images, a generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm is used (CycleGAN). To train the CycleGAN, six videos of VATS lobectomies were used from which 1819 frames of non-bleeding instances and 3178 frames of massive bleeding instances were used. Figure 1 (Top) illustrates the training process of this algorithm.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
CycleGAN was successful in generating images that mimic massive bleeding. The performance of the CycleGAN algorithm was tested on a new video dataset not used during the training process. Figure 1 (Bottom) illustrates four frames of this video that are given as inputs and CycleGAN outputs the corresponding massive bleeding figures. In other words, the trained CycleGAN can transform any laparoscopic lobectomy image into its corresponding massive bleeding version where the content of the original image is preserved (e.g. location of tools in the scene) while the style of each figure is changed to massive bleeding (i.e. blood automatically added to the appropriate locations on the figure).

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The result indicates a promising approach to supplement the lack of data for the rare massive bleeding event that can occur during VATS lobectomy as any non-bleeding image of lobectomy can be transformed to a massive bleeding style. Supplemented data could potentially be used by event/activity recognition AI algorithms to detect instances of massive bleeding in a surgical video and guide the human rater to pinpoint massive bleeding events for faster video review. Future work could be dedicated to developing AI algorithms to identify surgical strategies and actions that potentially lead to massive bleeding and would warn surgeons if their approach could potentially lead to a massive bleeding event before occurrence.

Boyd<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Stanford University, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Palo Alto, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: 
Cardiac surgery has historically been driven by innovation. Incredible diversity characterizes cardiac surgery research, from topics studied to technologies utilized. Here, we examined trends in research for six realms of cardiac surgical practice from 1980 to 2020.

<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 
We created a database of academic cardiac surgeons (n=546) at all 79 accredited cardiothoracic surgery training institutions in the United States in 2020. Surgeon-specific publication data were collected through Scopus and PubMed to find a total of 33,551 unique publications. Abstracts were queried for terms related to transplant, mechanical circulatory support (MCS), coronary revascularization, mitral valve, aortic valve, and aortic surgery to determine the subject of each manuscript. Annual incidence for each term was indexed to the total number of cardiac surgery publications in that year.

<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:
The proportion of transplant papers rapidly increased from 1.9% to 21.3% between 1983 and 1989, but 1995, in particular, marked the absolute maximum of transplant manuscripts at 23.6% (Figure). Since 1995 though, there has been a downward trend in the proportion of transplant papers to 9.1% in 2020. The proportion of coronary revascularization articles has similarly seen consistent decreases over the past two decades from an absolute maximum of 24.1% in 2000 to an absolute minimum of 9.5% in 2020. Conversely, there have been general increases in the proportion of MCS papers over recent years from 5.5% in 2002 to an absolute maximum of 14.8% in 2019. Aortic valve papers comparably increased in proportion from the absolute minimum of 2.1% in 1992 to the absolute maximum of 13.9% in 2017 before decreasing to 8.0% in 2020. Mirroring these trends, mitral valve publications consistently increased in proportion from 3.2% in 1987 to the absolute maximum of 9.8% in 2013 before decreasing to 5.0% in 2020. Finally, we observed an increase in the proportion of aortic surgery papers from an absolute minimum of 1.7% in 1982 to the absolute maximum of 9.3% in 2007. After 2007, however, aortic surgery manuscripts decreased in proportion to 5.0% in 2019.

<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
We characterized trends in academic cardiac surgery research between 1980 and 2020, finding general decreases in the proportion of transplant and coronary revascularization papers, as well as general increases in the proportion of MCS and aortic valve papers, over the past two decades. Such research trends may be driven by rapid technological advancements and may demonstrate how cardiac surgery is a specialty driven by innovation.
