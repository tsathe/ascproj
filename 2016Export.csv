Withanolides are a unique class of naturally-derived Hsp90 inhibitors that are highly efficacious in preclinical TNBC models, but fairly hydrophobic in vivo. Synthetic high-density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanoparticles have been safely used in clinical cardiology trials and recently shown by our group to conjugate to withanolides to improve drug delivery, solubility, and efficacy in aggressive adrenal cancers in vivo. sHDL provides targeted drug delivery as a ligand to the SR-B1 surface receptor leading to cholesterol uptake and efflux. TNBCs highly overexpress SR-B1 and we hypothesize that combining withanolides with sHDL will enhance their delivery to TNBCs through improved targeting via SR-B1.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Validated human TNBC cell lines (MD-MBA468LN,MDA-MB231,SUM159) were evaluated for SR-B1 mRNA expression levels by qPCR, and protein levels confirmed by Western blot. Fluorescent labeled sHDL was used to evaluate SR-B1 mediated drug uptake in vitro under fluorescence microscopy, and used for tumor targeting in vivo with whole body IVIS spectrum imaging of mouse xenograft tumors (MD-MBA468LN). Withanolide (WGA-TA) IC<sub>50</sub> values were obtained using 72 h CellTiter-Glo (CTG) assays.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: All TNBC cell lines had significantly (p&lt;0.01) higher SRB1 expression by qPCR and Western blot compared to fibroblast or Jurkat cells (SUM159 4-5 fold, MDA-MB468LN 8-10 fold, MDA-MB231 2-4 fold). Fluorescent labeled sHDL uptake in vitro demonstrated cytosolic uptake of nanoparticles at significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher levels within the high SR-B1 expressing cell line (MDA-MB468LN) compared to the lower SR-B1 expressing cell line (MDA-MB231). Fluorescent sHDL uptake was almost completely inhibited by receptor saturation through pre-treatment with 10-fold excess sHDL (p&lt;0.05). In vivo tumor uptake of fluorescent labeled sHDL using IVIS spectrum imaging in the MDA-MB469LN mouse xenograft model demonstrated highest radiant efficiency in the tumor, with uptake in the liver where it is metabolized and significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower radiant efficiency in other organs. Using CTG assays, treatment with sHDL up to 20 &mu;M showed no changes to cell viability. In TNBC, IC<sub>50</sub> values of WGA-TA vs. sHDL-WGA-TA were not statistically different with IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations ranging from 18-125 nM. Both formulations had significantly lower IC<sub>50</sub> values when compared to MCR5 control cells (6-41 fold lower; p&lt;0.05).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Conjugation of WGA-TA with sHDL nanoparticles confers improved SR-B1 receptor-mediated targeting both in vitro and in vivo in TNBC without inhibiting the potency of withanolides in these tumor cells. This nanocarrier delivery system warrants further translational evaluation in vivo in patient-derived xenograft of TNBC to determine if improved targeting will confer enhanced treatment benefit and survival.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

At 48 h post-injection (peak liposome accumulation time), ex vivo NIR and CT imaging was performed. A clinical NIR imaging system (SPY&reg;, Novadaq) was used to measure the fluorescence intensity of tumor and adjacent lung tissue. Tumor-to-background-ratios (TBR) were calculated in inflated and deflated states. The mean Hounsfield unit (HU) of lung tumor was quantified using the CT data set and a semi-automated threshold-based method.

Therefore, there is a great need to develop novel therapeutic strategies both to reduce tumor burden and control the release of hormones. To address this need, we developed and optimized a family of novel multifunctional upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP)-based theranostic unimolecular micelles capable of delivering a newly reported anticancer drug AB3 for NET-targeted combination chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and bioimaging. These UCNP-based micelles conjugated with photosensitizer (Rose Bengal, RB) specifically target NET cells  using somatostatin analog (KE108). In the current study we assessed the antitumor effects of the nanotheranostic micelles both in vitro and in vivo.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Stable UCNP-based micelles were prepared in an aqueous solution using multi-arm star amphiphilic block copolymer.  KE108 was conjugated for active tumor-targeting. AB3 was loaded into the photosensitive hydrophobic core of the resulting micelles. The effect of 980nm on singlet oxygen generation and in vitro drug release of the UCNP-based micelles were studied.  Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay in human medullary thyroid cancer cell line (MZ-CRC-1) treated with a family of AB3-loaded micelles (AB3 mM) for 48h with or without 980nm irradiation. The effect of the KE108 targeting ligands on the cellular uptake of the nanotheranostic micelles was measured by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). The antitumor efficacy of AB3-loaded micelles was determined in GI neuroendocrine (BON) xenografts after two intravenous injections performed with 7 day interval with a dose of 20 mg/kgBW. The group treated with UCNP-based micelles containing RB was irradiated for 15 min with 980nm laser at 4h post injection.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The family of UCNP-based NET-targeting unimolecular micelles was developed for targeted delivery of AB3 and RB to NETs. UCNP-based micelles for targeted and combined chemotherapy with PDT exhibited the strongest antiproliferative effect. Moreover, the targeted micelles exhibited a much higher cellular uptake than non-targeted micelles based on flow cytometry and CLSM analyses. Additionally, AB3 loaded micelles conjugated with RB and KE108 (i.e., T-RB-AB3), enabling combined chemo-therapy and PDT, induced the best antitumor efficacy (82% reduction in tumor volume) and did not cause any significant changes in body weight or survival. Pathological assessment of H&amp;E-stained sections of different organs of mice treated with T-RB-AB3 micelles did not indicate any signs of inflammation or necrotic regions.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The AB3-loaded UCNP-based micelles conjugated with both RB and KE108, offering combination chemotherapy and PDT, are more effective at suppressing NET cell growth while having minimal toxicity to non-NET cells.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

Hu<sup>1</sup>, J. Xu<sup>1</sup>, K. W. Liechty<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver,Laboratory For Fetal And Regenerative Biology, Department Of Surgery,Aurora, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  In 2014, the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 29.1 million Americans (9.3% of Americans) were living with diabetes, with the economic burden of diabetes related wound care estimated as $38.6 billion in 2007.  With the global prevalence of diabetes expected to double between 2000 and 2030, there will be an increasing need for innovative technologies to address the commensurate rise in chronic wounds.  We have previously demonstrated that diabetic wounds exhibit markedly decreased levels of the anti-inflammatory microRNA miR-146a.  Furthermore, we have shown improved healing of diabetic wounds after treatment with a lentiviral construct expressing stromal derived growth factor (SDF-1&alpha;). We hypothesize that the improved healing observed in diabetic wounds after SDF-1&alpha; treatment is partly due to increased miR-146a expression and the subsequent decrease in inflammation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   To test our hypothesis we isolated dermal fibroblasts from the skin of 10 week old diabetic (Db/Db) and non-diabetic (Db/+) mice.  These fibroblasts were then cultured and transfected with a lentivirus expressing either SDF-1&alpha; or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a control.  RNA was extracted from these fibroblasts, and real time PCR analysis was utilized to quantify the gene expression of NFkB, TRAF6, IRAK1, IL-6, MIP2 (IL-8), and miR-146a.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  When compared to fibroblasts from the skin of non-diabetic mice, fibroblasts isolated from the skin of diabetic mice demonstrated significantly decreased levels of miR-146a and increased levels of NFkB, TRAF6, IRAK1, IL-6, and MIP2 (IL-8).  When transfected with a lentivirus expressing SDF-1&alpha;, fibroblasts from the skin of diabetic mice demonstrated significantly increased expression of miR-146a, and significantly decreased expression of NFkB, TRAF6, IRAK1, IL-6, and MIP2 (IL-8).<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:  The significantly increased expression of inflammatory mediators NFkB, TRAF6, IRAK1, IL-6, and MIP2 (IL-8) observed in diabetic fibroblasts is nearly reversed with lenti-SDF-1&alpha; transfection.  Similarly, the decreased level of miR-146a observed in diabetic fibroblasts is completely reversed when diabetic fibroblasts are transfected with lenti-SDF-1&alpha;. The accelerated wound healing previously observed in diabetic skin after lenti-SDF-1&alpha; treatment may be due in part to the increased expression of miR-146a and decreased expression of inflammatory mediators NFkB, TRAF6, IRAK1, IL-6, and MIP2 (IL-8).  These results support further investigation of the role of SDF-1&alpha; in the pathogenesis of diabetic wound healing impairment and as a possible therapeutic target in the treatment of diabetic wounds.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

Our lab has previously shown moderate alcohol consumption in a swine model of metabolic syndrome worsens glucose metabolism by altering activation of the insulin signaling pathway in the liver. We examined the effect of alcohol consumption on apoptosis and autophagy signaling in the liver in our clinically relevant animal model of chronic myocardial ischemia and hypercholesterolemia.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Twenty-six Yorkshire swine were fed a hypercaloric, high-fat diet for 4 weeks then split into 3 groups: hypercholesterolemic diet alone (HCC, n= 9), hypercholesterolemic diet with vodka (HCV, n= 9), and hypercholesterolemic diet with wine (HCW,n = 8) for 7 weeks. Animals underwent euthanasia and liver tissue samples were harvested for analysis. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:   There were significant increases in the pro-apoptotic proteins caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9 and cleaved caspase 9 in the HCV group and a trend increase in the HCW group compared to control. There was a significant decrease in pro-apoptotic protein Bad in the HCW and HCV groups compared to control.  There was a significant increase in anti-apoptoic signal BCL-2 in the HCW group compared to the HCV group and trend increase in the HCW group compared to  control.   There were significant increases in pro-survival proteins AKT and p-AKT in the HCW and the HCV group compared to control.   There was significant increase in MTOR in HCW compared to HCV and a trend increase in compared to control. There was a significant increase in p-MTOR in the HCV group compared to the control.  There was a significant decrease in autophagy protein LCB-3 in the HCW and a trend decrease in HCV compared to the control. (See table)There was a trend increase in anti-apoptotic signal  p-BCL-2 in the HCW and HCV groups (p=0.151) compared to control. There were trend increases in the HCV group in AMPKA (p= 0.071) and TNF-alpha (p=0.071) compared to control. There was a trend increase pro- autophagy protein Beclin 1 in the HCW group (p=0.431) compared to control.  There were  trend increases in pro-autophagy proteins Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 in the HCW group and a trend decrease in the HCV group (p=0.120) compared to control.  There were no significant differences in cleaved Caspase 3 (p=0.296), Bax (p= 0.169), p-Bad (p =0.675), LKB-1 (p=0.523), P-AMPKA (p=0.758) or ATG5 (p=0.319) compared to the control.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Moderate Alcohol consumption altered cell survival protein expression related to apoptosis and autophage in pig liver in the setting of hypercholesterolemia.

However, pre-clinical model for the study of liver regeneration is yet to be established. Regeneration process of the liver requires continuous regenerative signals induced by hepatic injury, on the other hand, transplanted cells require functional advantage compared to the remnant cells to repopulate efficiently in recipient's body. One of the sufficient models for these demands is clearly retrorsine with partial heaptectomy (PH) model. However, no study has been reported using large animal including porcine. Here we demonstrate the first established porcine model with retrorsine and PH.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  G&ouml;ttingen miniature pigs were treated with 2 intra-peritoneal administrations of retrorsine in different doses; 30mg, 50mg and 100mg/kg respectively, or saline as a control, 2 weeks apart. Four weeks after the second administration of retrorsine, animals underwent PH in different volumes; 50%, 60% and 85%. The animals were sacrificed on 10, 14 and 28 days after the PH and the resected liver volume and histological alterations were evaluated. Blood samples were obtained every 7 days until and every 3 days after the PH to analyze hepatobilially enzymes and synthesized proteins. The quantity of serum and liver tissue retrorsine concentration was determined by LC-MS/MS.  Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 and EpCAM were performed on the liver tissue.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The Animals injected 100 mg/kg retrorsine or performed 85% PH were resulted in dead with severe liver injury. Blood test demonstrate that distinct liver disorder was sustained after PH. Liver regeneration was inhibited in animals as 20% volume reduction at day 10 of 60% PH animals with pre-surgical administration of 50mg/kg retrorsine. The histological study demonstrated the explosive puff and cytoplasmic vacuoles were remained in retrorsine treated animals at day 10. The immunohistochemical staining showed the expression of Ki-67 in hepatocytes and EpCAM in biliary epithelium were suppressed in retrorsine treated animals. LC-MS/MS determined the quantity of accumulated retrorsine in the liver tissue while retrorsine was not detected in the blood.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We could successfully demonstrate the first large animal model of retrorsine and 60% PH characterized by sustained liver injury with suppression of hepatic regeneration. We believe that it is a promising model for improving preclinical study of liver regenerative medicine.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

Although there are numerous publications on clinical management of obstructive jaundice, there are very few reports regarding the effects of it on cancer biology itself partly due to lack of stable model. The standard murine model for cholestasis is the partial ligation of the common bile duct (pBDL), which is known to have very short survival, usually less than 3-4 days. Recently, a long term survival cholestasis model that totally ligate hepatic bile duct (tHBDL) was reported. Here we compared tHBDL model with standard pBDL model on their characteristics.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  C57Black6 mice were subjected to sham, pBDL and tHBDL operations. For the tHBDL model, total ligation of the hepatic bile duct was performed at the level where left and median lobe bile ducts, as well as the duct from upper right lobe were completely obstructed, whereas right lower lobe bile duct was spared. Of note, cholecystectomy was added to all tHBDL model. For pBDL model, the suture was tied down tightly at the common bile duct with surgical needle placed by the side, and then the needle was removed leaving a defined lumen within the ligation. Survival was determined by humane endpoints and assessed by Kaplan-Meier method. Weights of body, liver and spleen were measured on the indicated days. Intraoperative complications were also recorded.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 24 mice that received pBDL mice died between 3-4 days after operation. On the other hand, mice that underwent tHBDL were observed to survive over 14 days, longest survivor was over 2 months. After 2 days, pBDL model showed the significant body weight loss compared with sham and tHBDL. An increase of liver weight was observed in both pBDL and tHBDL groups, where it was much heavier in tHBDL group than pBDL group. Spleen of tHBDL model was heavier than other groups, on the other hand, weight of spleen in pBDL group was lighter than sham surgery group. In tHBDL model, enlargement of right lobe was observed. Most common complication during the procedure was bleeding from portal vein or liver and technique for tHBDL model was stabilized due to good exposure of procedure field with assistance.    <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Total hepatic bile duct ligation model was clearly more stable model than standard partial bile duct ligation model, which is most commonly used. Given the longer survival, total hepatic bile duct ligation model provide us tool to investigate the biological impact of obstructive jaundice.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","General Surgery"

Implantation of liver organoids generated ex vivo by three-dimensional (3D) culture techniques may serve as an adjunct or alternative to liver transplantation.  Efficient high-engraftment methods of introducing organoids into the liver parenchyma have not been established.  In this study, we aim to develop a reliable surgical technique to implant liver organoids into the liver and assess their ability to engraft and function.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Liver organoids composed of either hepatocytes alone or hepatocytes co-cultured with stellate cells were generated by 3D culture in rotating wall vessel bioreactors.  Primary hepatocytes and stellate cells were isolated from ROSA26 C57BL/6 mice, in which &beta;-galactosidase was expressed under a ubiquitous promoter, so that engrafted cells could be easily identified by X-gal staining when implanted into wild-type mice.  Some recipient mice underwent simultaneous two-thirds partial hepatectomy to determine whether hepatocytes within implanted organoids proliferated in response to acute liver insufficiency. As control, freshly isolated primary hepatocytes were transplanted as single-cell suspensions.  At various time-points after implantation, engraftment of liver organoids was qualitatively and quantitatively determined. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that hepatocytes within liver organoids had cortical actin organization and produced extracellular matrix.  Organoids maintained their 3D structure up to 7 days after implantation within recipient livers and engraftment efficiency was superior to that of single cells.  Generating liver organoids with stellate cell co-culture and performing two-thirds partial hepatectomy on recipient mice did not appear to improve engraftment efficiency.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Implantation of liver organoids generated by 3D tissue culture is promising for development as a novel surgical therapy for ESLD.

It has been reported that the STAT3 pathway is involved in hepatic fibrogenesis. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the major effector cells for liver fibrosis, and HSC activation is characterized by increased proliferation and over-expression of &alpha;-smooth muscle actin, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Recently, our team developed a series of novel small-molecule inhibitors of STAT3 and demonstrated their potent anti-tumor effects in breast cancer cells. In the present study, we tested their anti-fibrogenic effects using activated HSC.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The proliferation of activated human and rat HSC cell lines LX-2 and HSC-T6 were measured by Alamar Blue.

Dekaney<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill,Chapel Hill, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Enteritis is a significant side effect of chemotherapy, and is a potential dose-limiting complication. Pharmacotherapy can diminish symptoms, but there are no effective therapies to prevent or treat the intestinal epithelial injury associated with enteritis, most likely because the mechanisms guiding epithelial damage and repair are unknown. Our preliminary studies suggest that enteric bacteria play a critical role in precipitating mucosal damage after treatment with doxorubicin (Dox), a common chemotherapeutic drug. Following Dox, mice treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABRX) do not show the small intestine crypt loss, increased crypt depth, or alterations in proliferation demonstrated in wild type mice (WT). Bacteria and bacterial products signal via distinct toll like receptors (TLRs), while MyD88 is a key adapter molecule utilized by nearly all TLRs to activate downstream signaling pathways. 'Knocking out' MyD88 in the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) specifically eliminates IEC bacterial signaling, and therefore allows an evaluation of the role of IEC bacterial signaling in mediating the bacterial contribution to enteritis. In the current study, we utilize this knock out model to determine whether elimination of bacterial IEC signaling is responsible for protection from Dox-induced enteritis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  At 10 weeks of age, control or IEC-specific MyD88 KO mice (Villin<sup>Cre</sup>/MyD88<sup>fl/fl</sup>) were treated with a single intraperitoneal dose of Dox (20 mg/kg) and euthanized five days following treatment. The jejunum was fixed and stained with H&amp;E for histologic analysis. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: While ABRX mice demonstrate significantly less weight loss than WT mice five days after Dox, MyD88 KO mice demonstrated weight loss equivalent to WT mice (WT 19.5% &plusmn; 2.4; ABRX 5.1% &plusmn; 4.6; MyD88 KO 17.5% &plusmn; 3.0). ABRX mice demonstrate significantly greater crypt survival than WT mice five days after Dox, and do not demonstrate increased crypt depth typical of WT mice in their hyper-proliferative state after Dox, while MyD88 KO mice demonstrate a phenotype comparable to WT mice (graph). <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: In response to insult with the chemotherapeutic Dox, MyD88 KO mice demonstrate intestinal damage followed by hyper-proliferation similar to WT mice. This suggests that the protection from damage demonstrated in ABRX mice is not due to elimination of epithelial bacterial signaling. Future studies will investigate other potential signaling pathways (e.g. penetration of a compromised epithelial barrier) to elucidate how depletion of bacteria protects from Dox-induced damage. This will allow determination of a prospective molecular target for prevention of chemotherapy-induced enteritis.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

Hispanics have the highest prevalence compared to non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks, with Black patients having the lowest prevalence. Differences in the incidence of NAFLD among race/ethnicity may be related to visceral adipose tissue (VAT), as Blacks have less VAT than Whites and Hispanics.  The exact mechanisms behind the ethnic and racial discrepancies are unclear. Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles that contain messenger RNA, microRNA, and proteins, that are potential mediators of systemic disease via the delivery of genetic material to distant organs. We believe that adipocyte-derived exosomes may be the direct mechanistic link between obesity and NAFLD, and exosomal differences may explain the ethnic and racial disparities. We have previously shown that adipocyte exosomes from mixed race/ethnicity donors lead to a dysregulation of gene expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF&Beta;-1) mediators in cultured hepatocytes.

VAT exosomes from one Black (BMI 51) and one Hispanic (BMI 46) female patient were applied to HepG2 cells in culture with and without TGF&Beta;-1 exposure. PAI-1 protein expression was analyzed with ELISA, and compared via t-test. Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated once for each donor.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:TGFB-1 exposure to HepG2 cells increased PAI-1 expression when compared to control cells (p= &lt;0.05). Addition of exosomes from the Black patient decreased PAI-1 expression in HepG2 cells exposed to TGFB-1 (p=0.034), with expression levels that were similar to baseline (Table).  In contrast, there was no difference in PAI-1 expression in HepG2 cells exposed to TGFB-1 and exosomes from the Hispanic patient when compared to cells co-cultured with TGFB-1 alone. Exosomes from neither donor altered PAI-1 expression in the absence of TGFB (p= &gt;0.05).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:HepG2 cells co-cultured with TGF&Beta;-1 had an increase in PAI-1 protein expression. VAT exosomes from a Black patient inhibited TGFB-1 induced production of PAI-1 in hepatocytes. However, exosomes from a Hispanic patient did not inhibit this TGFB-1 induced upregulation of PAI-1.  Racial differences in exosomal content and function likely exist, and may be the mechanism behind the known ethnic and racial differences in NAFLD prevalence.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","General Surgery"

Joseph<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Texas Tech University Health Sciences,Department Of Surgery,Odessa, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Acute appendicitis can present with a wide range of symptoms from an indolent course to severe peritonitis and overwhelming sepsis. The patients clinical status often indicates the severity of the disease and if perforation and diffuse peritonitis is present. While there have been many attempts to identify patients who may develop sepsis and peritonitis, little has been found as to the cause of the most severe cases.Actinomyces, a gram positive facultative anaerobe, is part of the normal flora of the mouth, GI tract, and female vagina, however when pathologic it causes severe inflammation, gangrene, perforation, and obstruction. Actinomyces can easily be identified on pathologic examination by the formation of sulfur granules. We hypothesized that Actinomyces could be a causative agent in patients who present with perforated or gangrenous appendicitis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We did a retrospective review of the last 102 appendix specimens removed for acute appendicitis at our institution. Pathologic specimens were reviewed by a single pathologist to identify sulfur granules or actinomyces species within the specimen. Demographic data, lab value, and radiology were reviewed for all patients in the review. Appendiceal specimens were categorized as either gangrenous/perforated or acute inflammation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were a total of 20 cases of perforated/gangrenous appendicitis amongst our 102 cases (19.6%). For patients with gangrene/perforation (n=20) there were 7 cases of Actinomyces identified (35%). For the 82 patients with acute inflammation, Actinomyces was identified in 6 specimens (7%). p=0.0008The average WBC level for all patients in our sample was 14.5. No clinically significant difference was found in WBC levels between gangrenous/perforated and acutely inflamed (14.4/ 14.5). However, patients with Actinomyces had a slightly higher average WBC of 15.3.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In patients with gangrenous/perforated appendicitis there is a 35% chance that Actinomyces is present in the appendix. While in patients without perforation/gangrene there is a 7% chance of identifying Actinomyces. Patients with Actinomyces were found to have a slightly higher WBC level then the patients without, however this was not statically significant.This data suggests that Actinomyces may be a cause of gangrenous/perforated appendicitis. Since Actinomyces is best treated with a long course of Penicillin based antibiotics, patients with gangrene/perforation may benefit from penicillin based treatment for longer than the standard 2 week course. Finally, Actinomyces may account for failure of non-operative management in selected patients.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","General Surgery"

Greeno<sup>1</sup>, M. Yamamoto<sup>1</sup>, J. Davydova<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Minnesota,Department Of Surgery,Minneapolis, MN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Interferon-&alpha;  (IFN) is a cytokine known to have direct and indirect antitumor effects. Previous studies have shown that IFN-based chemoradiation therapy (CRT) can improve survival after resection of pancreas cancer. However, its clinical utility to this point has been limited due to the severe toxicity related to its use. Our aim in this study is to evaluate our group's novel oncolytic adenovirus (OAd) which allows targeting IFN treatment to cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. We have previously shown the ability of IFN to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy as well as demonstrated an increased therapeutic effect of the drug in immunocompetent models. This study was conducted to analyze the combination of 5FU chemotherapy and our OAd in vitro in order to assess the interaction of treatments and determine the optimum combined treatment regimen.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Treatments were analyzed in two pancreatic cancer and one esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines: Panc1, S2013, and OE19. Recombinant OAds expressing luciferase rather than IFN were used to isolate the combination of 5FU and the virus. Two viral models were evaluated. Our therapeutic virus (Cox2) selectively replicative in Cox2 expressing cancer cells and a nearly identical but universally replicative virus (wild type) were compared. Cells were treated with 0, 1 or 10 viral particles per cell and 0, 5, 10, or 20 uM 5FU. Three timing regimens were used: simultaneous administration, 5FU 48 hours before virus, and virus 48 hours before 5FU. Crystal Violet and MTS Assays were used to measure cell death. Viral Copy number to assess viral replication was measured using qPCR.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Cell death analysis showed time dependent killing of each virus, with a 2 day delay for the Cox2 virus. 5FU and each virus produced dose dependent cell death independently. There was a nearly full additive effect seen in cell death from combining treatments only with simultaneously given 5uM 5FU and virus. 10 and 20 uM concentrations and virus produced less than fully additive cell death. There was little additive effect seen in treatments of virus 48 hours before 5FU, across all concentrations. Patterns observed were similar for both S2013 and OE19. Studies with Panc1 are in progress. Viral copy experiments are in progress. Treatments with 5FU 48 hours before virus are in progress. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our Cox2 OAd shows a killing effect similar to wild type in multiple cancer cell lines. When combined with 5FU treatment the expected addition in overall cell death from the independent treatments diminishes, more so as 5FU concentration increases. This may suggest an inhibition of the virus by 5FU. The killing ability and interaction of the combination treatments appears different when the timing of treatments is varied, suggesting the possibility of a treatment regimen with optimal therapeutic effect. Further studies investigating different chemotherapeutic drugs should be conducted to examine these trends.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

Increasing rates of antimicrobial resistant bacteria have increased the morbidity, mortality and cost of treating these infections.   Visible light sterilization (VLS) using high intensity LEDs and lasers have been adapted into several medical applications and have shown bactericidal activity. The inactivation mechanism is believed to be oxygen dependent photoexcitation of bacterial endogenous porphyrins, which leads to the production of a cytotoxic singlet oxygen species. While some research has been done in this field, an in depth comparison of common clinically pathogenic bacteria in a single study has not been published. Here we demonstrate a comprehensive evaluation of common gram-positive and gram-negative species at varying treatment times, intensities, bacterial concentrations, and photokinetic doses. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Visible light emitting diodes centered at 403.0-nm &plusmn; 10.8 were used to illuminate a panel of four relevant HAI facultative anaerobic bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus Aureus (ATCC 29213), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Streptococcus Pneumoniae (ATCC 49619). The E. coli K-12 strain transformed with the pCIG mammalian expression vector conferring ampicillin resistance via expression of the &beta;-lactamase gene.

MTC commonly metastasizes to the liver, and when diffusely disseminated remains a therapeutic challenge as there are currently no curative options. The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of an in vivo model of MTC liver metastasis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: TT, a human MTC cell line, was genetically engineered to overexpress Notch3, a tumor suppressor in MTC, in the presence of doxycycline. Prior to injection, the cells were plated, and treated with doxycycline every 48 hours for 12 days to ensure adequacy of the inducible construct in vitro. 1x10<sup>7 </sup>TT-Notch3 cells were injected intra-splenically into male nu/nu mice. The cells were allowed 2 minutes to enter circulation, and a splenectomy was performed. The mice were then recovered, given a standard chow diet, and the tumors were allowed to propagate. Physical examination of the mice at 4, 6, and 8 weeks revealed no external signs of intra-abdominal tumor burden such as ascites or palpable masses. Each mouse was imaged via computerized tomography (CT) scan with Fenestra VC contrast agent (MediLumine Inc, Montreal, Quebec) to evaluate for presence of tumors at 12 weeks. The mice were then sacrificed to determined correlation with CT findings and gross specimens. Lastly, the liver tumors were quantified with the use of Inveon Research Workplace (IRW, Siemens Healthcare).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Western blotting analysis for the Notch3 protein revealed maintenance of induction in the TT-Notch3 cells over a period of 12 days in vitro. There was 100% survival of these mice at 12 weeks. When imaged, 100% of mice demonstrated the presence of liver metastasis on CT scanning with Fenestra VC contrast. The imaging results correlated well in 80% of mice on necropsy with grossly visible tumors (Figure 1).

Chao<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch,Surgery,Galveston, TEXAS, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch,Pharmacology And Toxicology,Galveston, TEXAS, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is progressive disease involving irreversible histologic damage and pancreatic insufficiency. CP is the result of repeated acute pancreatitis RAP, where damaged pancreatic tissue is replaced with scar. There is no cure for CP, and current treatment options are limited to supportive care and symptom palliation rather than targeting disease pathogenesis. Development of a novel therapeutic that reduces the severity of RAP would thereby prevent or delay progression to CP.  We have found that the naturally-occurring flavanoid, apigenin, induced a protective phenotype in a preclinical mouse model of RAP, preserving pancreatic architecture and limiting stromal fibrosis. As a potential molecular target, we investigated the effect of apigenin on MAPK pathway activation during pancreatitis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  RAP was induced in 6-8 week-old C57BL/6 mice (Harlan Laboratories, Houston, TX) using serial cerulein (CR) injections: 50 &mu;g/kg, 5 hourly intraperitoneal (IP) injections, 3 d/wk, for 4 wks  (Bachem, Torrance, CA):. Apigenin treatment was initiated after one week of RAP-induced pancreatitis: 50 &mu;g, oral gavage, once daily, 6 d/wk, for 3 wks (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Control mice received the vehicles (saline IP, and 0.5% methylcellulose with 0.025% Tween20 by oral gavage) following the same schedule. Mouse pancreata were harvested, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a heat-mediated antigen retrieval method, avidin/biotin blocking, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit and DAPI-containing mounting medium (Vector Lab, Burlingame, CA). Slides were counter-stained with hematoxylin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). Ten non-overlapping 400x images of each pancreas and analyzed using the validated free-ware ImmunoRatio program, which calculated the percentage of positively DAB-stained nuclei. Nuclear translocation of pERK served as conjugate for MAPK pathway activation. Statistical analysis consisted of one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Basal pERK expression was predominately cytoplasmic within the vehicle and apigenin groups. CR-induced RAP resulted in significant MAPK pathway activation, i.e. pERK translocation to the nucleus (nuclear positivity). Daily 50 &mu;g doses of apigenin, while continuing to induce RAP, resulted in a significant reduction of pERK nuclear translocation (p &lt; 0.001) compared to pancreata treated with CR alone. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Apigenin inhibited MAPK pathway activation by limiting pERK nuclear translocation. The down-stream effector of the MAPK pathway, pERK, may serve as a transcription factor for the expression of genes regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Thus, down-regulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway is one of apigenin's molecular mechanism by which pancreatic injury is reduced during RAP.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

An<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Chicago,Department Of Surgery,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Ulcerative colitis (UC) has an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) due to the genomic instability caused by chronic inflammation, demonstrating a cumulative risk as high as 18% after 30 years of disease duration. Though sporadic CRC has a well described step-wise pattern of genetic and molecular alterations leading to malignancy, the dynamics of CRC arising in the setting of chronic inflammation is still not fully understood. In order to better understand the complex set of events leading to the development and progression of colitis-associated cancer, we will use a dynamic agent-based computational model (ABM) of colonic epithelium, termed the GI Cancer ABM (GICABM). The GICABM reproduces genetic events in colonic epithelium that lead to cancer, with the effect of inflammation manifested as increased rates of DNA damage. The GICABM is used to generate in silico patient populations, and is validated by matching epidemiological colon cancer rates seen in both sporadic and UC populations.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The GICABM is comprised of agents representing colonic epithelial cells and utilizes the DNA damage-repair functions from our prior oncogenesis ABMs. Rules for the GICABM were derived from existing literature concerning genetic factors associated with colon cancer. DNA damage was generated by a variable probability of mutation in a group of thirteen genes which have been implicated in the development of colon cancer: p53, telomerase, K-Ras, EGFR, TGF-beta, APC, Beta-catenin, PIK3CA, DCC, E-cadherin, SMAD4, BRAF, and C-src. The effect of chronic inflammation was modeled by increasing the rate of DNA damage. Sporadic colon cancer rates were retrieved from the SEER database, and a literature survey was used to generate a normalized risk progression for UC patients.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The GICABM produced in silico populations (N = 1 million patients) over 60 years of simulated time that effectively reproduced the epidemiological data for both sporadic and UC CRC, with UC patients exhibiting a 2-5 fold increase in CRC risk when compared to sporadic CRC rates. Analysis of mutational patterns reproduced known patterns of mutational progression for sporadic CRC, and further suggested a conserved sequence for UC CRC involving impairment of DNA repair, followed by proliferation/immortality mutations.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The GICABM effectively reproduces existing data concerning sporadic CRC, and extrapolates the behavior of UC CRC. It allows visualization of the complex, lengthy processes involved in oncogenesis, and provides insight into mutational and evolutionary dynamics that lead to cancer under different conditions. This GICABM can potentially augment more traditional oncology research as both a hypothesis generating tool as well as a means for in silico hypothesis testing.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","General Surgery"

Recent studies in a variety of settings have provided evidence that targeted therapy with purified omega-3 fatty acids or synthetic pro-resolution lipids may attenuate acute inflammation and hasten the transition to healing.  Administration of highly processed nutraceutical agents may, however, be attended with unanticipated toxicities or undesirable pharmacologic effects. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that resolution of peritoneal inflammation would be enhanced by pre-treatment with fish oil rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), precursors to more potent lipid mediators of resolution. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  C57/BL6 mice were begun on a daily oral gavage of 200uL Marinol&reg; C-38, a fish oil blend containing 17% DHA and 22% EPA (FO) or saline as a control (C).  At day 7, 3% thioglycollate media was injected into the peritoneum to create a chemical peritonitis, and exudates were collected by peritoneal lavage at 0hr (no injection), 48hr, and 96hr.  Lipid inflammatory mediators in lavage fluid were assessed via ELISA (Leukotriene B4 {LTB4}, Resolvin D1 {RvD1}).  Cells harvested via lavage were isolated for differential Wright-Giemsa staining, and cells collected at 96hr (95% macrophages) were assessed for macrophage differentiation markers via quantitative PCR.  Additional cells were incubated in media alone for 16hr or with the addition of LPS (100ng/ml).  Ex vivo cytokine secretion was assessed in culture media via ELISA (IL-6, IL-10, IL-1&beta;, TNF&alpha;), and phagocytic capacity was assessed via uptake of fluorescent E. coli bioparticles.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Fish Oil (FO) increased the ratio of RvD1/LTB4 in the peritoneal cavity at 0hr.  No significant changes were observed in total counts of polymorphonuclear cells, macrophages or lymphocytes in the lavage fluid, and FO did not significantly alter mRNA markers of macrophage phenotype.  FO interestingly increased ex vivo TNF&alpha; secretion after stimulation with LPS in cells harvested at 96hr.  No effect of FO was seen on LPS-stimulated particle phagocytosis.   <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our findings provide evidence that nutraceutically relevant doses of FO supplements enhance production of pro-resolution lipid mediators such as RvD1 relative to that of pro-inflammation mediators such as LTB4 following induction of chemical peritonitis, without altering counts or transition states of local innate immune cell populations.  These observations stand in contrast to more powerful and global effects of purified compounds, suggesting that the latter may be more effective in enhancing resolution, but also in inviting unwanted pharmacologic sequelae.  Further studies will be required to determine whether FO-induced alterations in the RvD1/LTB4 ratio can hasten resolution without compromising other homeostatic functions.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

Recently, integrated laparoscopic devices, which simultaneously combine bipolar and ultrasonic energies, has resulted in increased interest in this technology for open surgery.  This study was performed to quantitatively compare heat transfer and collateral tissue damage that may be associated with these devices.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Three serial firings for each setting of the bipolar (Ligasure Small Jaw), ultrasonic (Harmonic Focus), and integrated (Thunderbeat Open Fine Jaw) devices were applied in vivo to various porcine tissue types including: liver, muscle, and thyroid.  Thermocouplers were inserted into surrounding tissue at 1 mm intervals to measure temperatures over time as the devices were fired.  Temperature was reported in degrees Celsius. Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) monitoring was performed to determine the practical implications of the heat generation in tissue. This was done with firings of each device at successively decreasing distances from the RLN until signal was lost.  Statistical analysis included t-tests and ANOVA was performed using STATA.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The amount of heat generated in the tissue between the lowest and highest settings was similar for each device tested (p=0.11-0.81).  However, when comparing heat generated across these devices for the peak temperature reached at 1 mm, the peak temperature recorded in liver tissue was observed with HF (103.4 &plusmn; 44.1), in muscle tissue &ndash; with OFJ (57.9 &plusmn; 16.9); and in thyroid &ndash; with LS (54.8 &plusmn; 25.1). RLN signal was lost after firing 1mm away from the RLN for all devices while nerve monitor signal was not affected by firing at &ge;2 mm.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Comparable quantitative data on heat dispersion and collateral tissue damage by surgical energy devices is one of the important factors that surgeons use to make informed decisions regarding the devices they choose for surgery. Our findings conclude that heat transfer as a function of depth was similar among all three devices with the exception of HF resulting in significantly higher temperatures than OFJ and LS in the liver. Liver tissue showed the most consistent results between experiments therefore we recommend that liver tissue be used for any future experiments on heat transfer to tissue.  Although collateral heat transfer is an important consideration, tissue cutting speed and dissection capability are also key factors when choosing a surgical device for clinical applications.  Further studies are required to evaluate all relevant performance attributes in a controlled clinical environment.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

While the exact mechanistic pathogenesis of IBD remains elusive, its origins are known to be both complex and multi-factorial; involving variants in gene expression, exposure to environmental agents, and a dysregulated immune response. At the heart of suspected disease expression lies the tenet that aberrant gut-derived immune factors play a central role in pathogenesis. This work is based on the hypothesis that potential decreased expression of the brush border enzyme, Intestinal Alkaline Phosphastase, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, may contribute to disease development in these populations.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Colonic biopsy samples were obtained from 17 patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, as well as from 10 healthy controls. In IBD patients, specimens were obtained both from inflamed and non-inflamed areas. Inflammatory cytokine levels and IAP mRNA was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:When compared with tissue from healthy controls, IAP mRNA expression was decreased in both inflamed and non-inflamed samples taken from patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC), with the most significant decrease seen in inflamed tissue( Healthy Controls: 1.15, UC non-inflamed 0.85 (p=0.07), UC inflamed 0.19 (p=0.01)) . In a smaller sample size, tissue samples from Crohn's patients did not reveal a significant difference in IAP expression when compared to healthy controls (Healthy Controls: 1.15, Crohn's disease inflamed and non-inflamed: 1.16, 1.02). Inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-8 were higher in IBD patients, specifically in inflamed tissue, with expression in Ulcerative Colitis patients being particularly high, correlating to lower levels of IAP, a gut derived anti-inflammatory enzyme (IL-8: HC 0.82, CD non-inflamed and inflamed 8.4 and 276 (p=0.2 and 0.002), UC non-inflamed and inflamed 22.5 and 3441 (p=0.06 and 0.007) TNF-a: HC 0.91, CD non-inflamed and inflamed 1.76 and 6.24 (p=0.05 and 0.006), UC non-inflamed and inflamed 9.17 and 47.3 (p=0.002 and p=0.01)).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Decreased levels of IAP expression, correlating with increased cytokine levels in the inflamed mucosa of patients with Ulcerative Colitis may indicate a role for the enzyme in disease pathogenesis and could lay groundwork for use of this agent as a therapeutic modality in future clinical studies.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","General Surgery"

Studying these effects in normal colonic mucosa is challenging due to the limited availability of in vitro models. Recently developed complex culture systems allowing the maintenance and expansion of multicellular structures derived from colonic mucosa, also known as colon organoids or epithelioids, have allowed new insight in colon tumorigenesis and response to inflammation. The goal of this study was to use colon organoids to investigate whether IL-17 promotes stemness in normal colonic mucosa.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Freshly isolated mucosa without evidence of malignancy was collected from human colon according to an established IRB-approved protocol. Samples from different areas of the colon were cultured independently and expanded in media containing R-Spondin, Noggin, EGF and Wnt3a. Each cultured sample was split in two grossly equal fractions that were subsequently treated with either IL-17 (100ng/ml) or vehicle control. After 24 hours, the organoids were harvested and mRNA was isolated. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to measure mRNA expression levels for interleukin-6 (IL-6), a known target of IL-17 used as positive control, as well as stem-cell markers ALDH1, and CD44. Paired t-test was used to compare expression levels between stimulated and control organoids.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Organoid cultures were established successfully and expanded for 10 days before experiments were performed. IL-17 stimulation resulted in significant upregulation of IL-6 expression compared to control (fold change 18.1, p=0.003). In addition, IL-17 induced CD44 (fold change 1.5, p=0.04), and ALDH1 (fold change 1.7, p=0.03).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In this proof-of-concept study, inflammatory stimulation in the form of IL-17 induced stem-cell associated genes in normal colonic mucosa. Colon organoids enable in vitro studies of tumorigenesis and allow the assessment of mucosal response to various stimuli.

Metformin has been shown to disrupt the mTOR pathway and is currently the subject of an ongoing phase III randomized trial as adjuvant treatment in breast cancer (NCT01101438). The flavone baicalein, which is present in the herb thyme and in asian herbal remedies, appears to be non-toxic in animals and humans. We have previously demonstrated that baicalein effectively inhibits cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting mTOR signaling. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of baicalein with metformin in triple-negative breast cancer.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  MDA-MB-468, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line, was treated with baicalein (0-80 uM) and metformin (0-10,000 uM) for 24-72 hours. Total protein lysates were obtained for immunoblot analysis of the mTOR pathway mediators S6K1 and S6, as well as the mTOR inhibitor DNA Damage-Inducible Transcript 4 (DDIT4). Cytotoxicity after 72 hours of treatment was evaluated by MTT assay. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Baicalein demonstrated dose-dependent growth inhibition of MDA-MB-468 in micromolar concentrations. By comparison, metformin required over a 60-fold higher concentration to achieve similar cytotoxicity (Figure 1A). Dose-dependent inhibition of phospho-S6K1 (pS6K1) and phospho-S6 (pS6) were observed following treatment with both baicalein and metformin. However, baicalein-induced phosphorylation blockade was more effective at a far lower concentration. The activity of DDIT4, an mTOR inhibitor, increased with higher concentrations of baicalein (Figure 1B). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Baicalein effectively inhibits growth of triple-negative breast cancer in vitro.

The 5-year relative survival rate is approximaly 6% for all stages. Up to 60% of the patients are found to have distant metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, at which median survival is around 6 months. The most common sites for distant metastases are the liver (80%), peritoneum (60%), lung and pleura (50-70%), and adrenal glands (25%). Prognosis of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), dissemination of cancer cells throughout the abdominal cavity, are particularly poor with median survival of only 6 weeks. This poor overall 5-year survival rate has not significantly changed over the past 5 decades, which reflects the fact that there is no effective treatment available for this condition. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid mediator produced by sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), plays critical roles in many aspects of cancer progression, such as cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. We have recently published that S1P link inflammation and cancer in colitis-associated cancer progression (Cancer Cell 2013). Given the fact that inflammation is known to be essential for establishment and progression of PC, where cancer cells need to adhere to the peritoneum and form a nodule, we hypothesized that S1P levels regulated by SphK1 and SphK2 in the host animal may have different mechanism in promoting progression of pancreatic cancer PC depending upon its levels. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma panc02-luc cells were intraperitoneally injected into SphK1 wild type (WT) or knockout (KO), or SphK2 WT or KO mice to generate PC model. Tumor burden was quantified using bioluminescence imaging. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. PC nodules were harvested 14 days after injection and analyzed. The proliferation was assessed by Ki-67 staining and apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL assay. We also compared mRNA expression by RT-PCR.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Circulating S1P levels were lower in SphK1 KO mice and higher in SphK2 KO mice compared with respective littermate WTs probably due to compensatory elevation of SphK1. Panc02-luc cells developed significantly less tumor burden, less inflammatory cell infiltration, and less cancer cell proliferation, but with no difference in apoptosis in PC of SphK1 KO mice. These results suggest that host S1P promotes PC progression by stimulation of proliferation of cancer cells. Interestingly, SphK2 KO mice developed less tumor burden, longer survival with elevated CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte infiltrates in PC.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results implicate an intriguing possibility that S1P levels in the host may have different mechanisms in promoting progression of pancreatic cancer PC depending upon its levels.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Despite the recent improvement in survival of patients with small resectable tumors, prognosis of unresectable PC that collectively represents over 80% of individuals remains dismal with the 5-year survival of 5% and median survival is within ten months. The classical clinical sign of pancreatic head cancer is painless jaundice. There have been numerous publications regarding the clinical benefit of bile drainage in obstructive jaundice, however, the effect of it on pancreatic cancer biology, such as tumor growth, has never been thoroughly investigated. We have recently published that conjugated bile acids (CBAs) binds to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), and it activate nuclear SphK2 that epigentically regulate gene expression (Nagahashi, Takabe, Zhou et al, Hepatology 2015). Indeed, it was reported that CBAs promote growth of cholangiocarcinoma through S1PR2. Thus, we hypothesized that CBAs from obstructive jaundice aggravate the pancreatic cancer progression via S1PRs.<br><br><strong>Method</strong>:  Expression of S1P receptors (S1PR1-5) in murine (panc02-luc) and human (MiaPaca-2) pancreatic cancer cell lines were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Cells were treated with CBAs with or without JTE-013 (S1PR2 antagonist) and viable cells were quantified using WST-8. Panc02-luc cells were implanted in the left lobe of the liver of C57/Bl6 mice with or without obstructive jaundice, created by left and middle bile duct ligation with cholecystectomy. Tumor burden was quantified using bioluminescence imaging on the indicated days and tumors were harvested on day 18.<br><br><strong>Result</strong>: Hielarchial cluster analysis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in The Cancer Genome Atlas (N=183) demonstrated that S1PR2, S1PR5 and SphK1 gene expressions have strong positive correlations. Among 5 S1P receptors, S1PR2 is the only one expressed in panc02-luc cells and S1PR2 and S1PR5 are expressed in MiaPaca-2 cells. CBA-mediated cell growth was inhibited by JTE-013, but JTE-013 alone was also found to be growth inhibitory even in the absence of CBA. In obstructive jaundice mice group, significant increase in tumor burden was observed by bioluminescence. Left lobe+tumor / body weight ratio was significantly larger in obstructive jaundice group.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Conjugated bile acid signaling via S1PR2 promotes pancreatic cancer cell growth. Obstructive jaundice aggravated pancreatic cancer, and further study is warranted to investigate the possibility of targeting S1PR2 as a potential new therapeutic for pancreatic cancer treatment.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Novel therapies are imperative as aggressive metastasis, chemo-resistance, and limited treatment options precipitate a 5-year survival to less than 10%. We have shown that Notch1 alteration reduces CCA cell growth in vitro; therefore, suggesting the importance of Notch1 in carcinogenesis.  More recently, we have identified xanthohumol (XN), a prenylated chalcone from hop plants, inhibits both hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinoma through Notch1 reduction. Despite this investigation, the role of XN in CCA remains unclear. We hypothesize that XN inhibits CCA proliferation through reducing Notch1 signaling. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Notch isoform expression in CCA cell lines (CCLP-1 and SG-231) was determined via Western analysis. The anti-proliferative effect of XN on CCA cell lines was assessed through 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide  (MTT), real-time imaging and colony forming assays. To determine mechanism of action, cell lysates were analyzed via Western blot for Notch1 signaling pathway members and apoptotic markers. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Western analysis revealed that basal levels of the Notch1 isoform were highly expressed indicating an integral relationship in CCA carcinogenesis. Statistically significant (p-value&lt;0.01) reductions in cell viability, when compared with control, were observed with XN treatment at concentrations of 5, 10, and 15&micro;M by approximately 23%, 46%, and 56% for CCLP-1 and 9%, 25%, and 38% for SG-231, respectively.  The colony formation assay showed apparent growth reductions formation starting at 5 &micro;M XN. Both cell lines demonstrated a dose dependent decrease in Notch1 expression. Reduced viability was mediated through apoptosis evidenced by decreases in cyclin D1 and survivin proteins.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Xanthohumol effectively inhibits CCA growth through the inhibition of Notch. Based on these findings along with reports in other organ-specific cancers, this provides further evidence of the importance of Notch signaling in carcinogenesis as well as XN as a novel anti-carcinogenic treatment.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Although there are multitudes of reasons for its aggressiveness, recent studies suggest that cancer stroma and stellate cells play a major role in tumor aggressiveness. PDA is extremely desmoplastic; almost 90% of the tumor is stroma. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) contribute extensively to this desmoplastic reaction. PSCs are activated by cancer cells, and vice versa leading this feedback loop to create a niche for pancreatic cancer in the primary and metastatic lesions. Triptolide (TPL) is a terpenoid compound with therapeutic potential against various cancers including PDA. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether triptolide and its water soluble prodrug, Minnelide (currently in Phase I trials), could inhibit the cancer cell-stellate cell cross talk to effectively suppress pancreatic cancer growth. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  In vitro, we used human PSCs and two human PCC lines: S2-VP10 and MIA PaCa-2. The effect of various chemotherapeutic drugs (Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, TPL, and TRAIL) on the viability of these cells was evaluated using the WST-8 assay.  The PCC-PSC interaction was studied by co-culturing the cells in transwell chambers. Effects of pretreatment of one cell type with TPL were studied on the other cell type in a co-culture setup. . Viability, migration and invasion were measured using the WST-8 and the Boyden chamber assay respectively. Expression of various ECM components (collagen, fibronectin), activation (&alpha;SMA, vimentin), and invasion markers (N-cadherin, MMPs) was estimated using qPCR and Western Blot.In vivo, quantification of desmoplastic reaction in the spontaneous pancreatic cancer murine model (KPC) was done by measuring collagen and &alpha;SMA expression in the Minnelide and saline treated tumors.  Kaplan-Meier survival curves were obtained for same model comparing the two groups.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Viability of PCCs was significantly decreased by various drugs while PSCs were only affected by TPL treatment. The proliferation of MIA PaCa-2 and S2-VP10 was markedly augmented in co-culture with untreated PSCs while TPL pre-treated PSCs did not show this effect. The invasive phenotype of PCCs, as suggested by their migration and invasion, was significantly augmented by co-culture with untreated PSCs while co-culture with TPL pre-treated PSCs failed to do so. TPL treatment resulted in decreased expression of &alpha;SMA, fibronectin HSF-1, HSP 70 and 47 in PSCs and reduced collagen production as compared to other drugs.Minnelide treated tumors in KPC mice had significantly decreased collagen and &alpha;SMA content. Minnelide treatment also increased the survival of these mice significantly as compared to saline arm<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our findings indicate that triptolide/Minnelide effectively targets ductal cancerous compartment and its associated stroma leading to disruption of the tumor-stroma interaction in pancreatic cancer.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Triptolide, a derivative of a Chinese herb and its water soluble pro-drug Minnelide, which was developed by our laboratory, has been previously shown to be effective against various solid organ cancers.

Xenograft mouse models using GBC cell lines (GbD1and NOZ) in athymic nude mice were used to analyze the efficacy of Minnelide against GBC.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In vitro, triptolide treatment (0-200 nM) resulted in a significant dose and time dependent decrease in cell viability in all three cell lines (p&lt;0.05). As opposed to our previous studies in pancreatic cancer cells in which triptolide induced apoptotic cell death, western blotting did not demonstrate apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a G1/S phase arrest following treatment with triptolide as compared to control treated cells in all three cell lines.Triptolide treatment results in a significant dose and time dependent decrease in the protein and mRNA levels of transcription factor SP1 in all three cell lines.

Mammen<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Kansas,Surgery,Kansas City, KS, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The incidence of melanoma has increased dramatically over the last few decades making it one of the fastest growing malignancies in the United States. Melanoma expresses a plastic and aggressive phenotype, lacking the majority of regulatory mechanisms due to the aberrant activation of various signaling pathways. In this context, aberrant activation of the Notch signaling pathway in melanoma has also been reported by our laboratory as well as by others. Also of importance, the oncogenic mutation predominantly at codon 600 in the BRAF gene (present in nearly 40&ndash;50% of melanoma patients) has changed treatment options for melanoma over the past decade. Unfortunately, recent studies report that the majority of patients treated with the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib eventually develop drug resistance. The mechanisms of resistance are still poorly understood. In the present study, we explore the role of Notch signaling in vemurafenib induced drug resistance in melanoma cells. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: For our experiments, we used various melanoma cell lines (SKMEL-28, UACC275 and A2058 cells). The hexoseaminidase assay was used to determine cell proliferation and to calculate the IC50 (drug concentration causing 50% growth inhibition) in drug sensitive and drug resistant cell lines. Drug-resistant cells were developed by repeatedly growing cells in culture media with increasing doses of drug with time. The surviving daughter resistant cells were compared to the parental sensitive cells using proliferation assay. The IC50 for these paired cell lines was used to determine the increase in resistance. Protein expression studies in cells were done by using standard immunoblotting techniques. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We observed an increased IC50 value of vemurafenib in drug resistant UACC275 cells. IC50 values at the 72hr time point for UACC-RV-10, UACC-RV-10(1), UACC-RV-15(1) and UACC-RV-15(2) (UACC275 isogenic cells) were ~15, 14, 25 and 22 &micro;M respectively as compared to the IC50 value for parental wild type UACC275 cells of ~0.50 &micro;M. We observed a similar pattern of increased IC50 values in other melanoma cell lines (B16/F10, SKMEL-28, A2058, M14, and melanoma patient derived cells). After several passage of culture in vemurafenib, we also noted changes in cell morphology with cells becoming small and round compared to their usual elongated and stretched appearance. We further evaluated the expression pattern of various Notch receptors in drug sensitive cells as compared to drug resistant isogenic cell lines. Levels of cleaved Notch-2 (10 fold) and -4 (3 fold) were significantly higher in drug resistant cells.(n=5) <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:A reductionist model of vemurafenib resistance can be developed using the UACC275 cell line.  Both Notch-2 and -4 levels are higher in vemurafenib resistant melanoma cells in this model.  Notch signaling may directly or indirectly play an important role in the development of vemurafenib drug resistance in melanoma cells.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

New polynuclear platinum analogs, Triplatin and TriplatinNC, were developed to overcome the pitfalls of the former platinum agents; drug resistance and severe toxicity (Farrell et al, Chem Soc Rev 2015). Pharmacokinetics limited the clinical efficacy of Triplatin in Phase II clinical trials. Development of TriplatinNC resolved the PK issue. With less cytotoxic properties it is expected to be more clinically useful if it is in fact as effective as Triplatin. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: MTT assay determined the IC50 of murine breast cancer 4T1-luc2 cells, and tube formation assay compared tube length of HUVEC cells when exposed to treatment. 4T1-luc2 cells were orthotopically implanted in female Balb/C mice 76 weeks of age. Tumor size was measured by caliper and bioluminescent imaging. Mice were randomized based on tumor size on day 1. Triplatin (0.3mg/kg), TriplatinNC (25mg/kg) or Saline was given ip on Day 1, 5, 9 and mice were sacrificed on Day 20. Lung metastasis was evaluated by ex vivo imaging. Pancreatic cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis, generated by ip injection of 1 million panc02-luc cells into C57/Blk6 mice, was used as a distant metastasis model.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:IC50 of 4T1-luc cells at 24, 48, and 72h were 89, 25, and 9&micro;M for Triplatin, and 61, 24, and 8&micro;M for TriplatinNC. Tube formation at 10&micro;M concentration of Triplatin and TriplatinNC, using the student's t-test a significant difference was found between groups, p=0.005 and p=0.002. Additionally 0.1&micro;M TriplatinNC was statistically significant, p=0.003. In 4T1-luc2 implanted model, Triplatin and TriplatinNC suppressed tumor size to 20% and 43% of the control respectively, by Day 20. Bioluminescent imaging on Day 7 demonstrated reduced tumor growth in Triplatin and TriplatinNC to 54% and 57% of the control, respectively. However, imaging data turned out to be inaccurate after day 10 due to ulceration and necrosis of the tumor. Triplatin and TriplatinNC significantly reduced the amount of lung metastasis to 14% and 21% of the control, respectively. In pancreatic cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis model, Triplatin reduced carcinomatosis to 14% and 35% of the control, TriplatinNC by 39% and 39% of the control, in female and male mice on Day 9, respectively. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Both Triplatin and TriplatinNC effectively suppressed 4T1-luc2 breast cancer cell growth, and angiogenesis in vitro. Both agents demonstrated growth suppression of the primary tumor. However, striking effects were observed in advanced models, both lung metastasis and peritoneal carcinomatosis.

S1P exerts its regulatory functions after it is secreted out of cells and by binding to specific G protein-coupled receptors. We previously demonstrated that S1P is a crucial mediator of breast cancer-induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, generation of new blood and lymphatic vessels, and promote metastasis to the lymph nodes and to the lung. Although important roles of S1P in breast cancer progression has been repeatedly reported in experimental models, the research field suffers from very few data on human patients due to the difficulty in accurate measurements of S1P levels in the clinical samples. In this study, we measure the levels of sphingolipids including S1P in serum from the patients with breast cancer utilizing state-of-the-art mass spectrometry.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective analysis was conducted on 49 patients who were pathologically diagnosed with stage I or II breast cancer. The serum from the patients were obtained at the time of diagnosis, prior to any treatment. Sphingolipids were measured by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). The levels of sphingolipids including S1P were analyzed with patients' clinical demographics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The levels of sphingolipids including sphingosine, dihydro-sphingosine, S1P, dihydro-S1P were detected successfully in the serum from 49 breast cancer patients. Despite our expectation, no significant differences in serum S1P levels were identified by age, hormone receptors (ER, PgR) and HER2 status, Ki-67 index, nuclear grade, lymphatic and vascular invasion of the tumor, pT, and pStage. Interestingly, however, S1P levels in patients with pathologically proven lymph node metastasis (median 2198, range 1575&ndash;3462 pmol/ml) was significantly higher than that in patients without lymph node metastasis (median 1977, range 1309&ndash;2746 pmol/ml) (P = 0.029). In contrast, levels of sphingosine in patients with lymph node metastasis showed trend to be lower compared to patients without lymph node metastasis (P = 0.073).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results indicate an important role of S1P during the process of lymph node metastasis of breast cancer patients. It may also implicate that serum S1P level may have a role as a biomarker for lymph node metastasis. Further study is required to investigate the mechanisms how S1P promotes the lymph node metastasis in human patients and whether S1P levels correlate with lymph node metastasis.

The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the major etiologic risk factor for the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anus, with greater than 90% of anal cancers being HPV positive (high-risk subtypes HPV16 and 18). With HPV infection, two viral oncoproteins (E6 and E7) are expressed and their intracellular molecular changes enhance cellular growth and inhibit cell death, promoting an environment for carcinogenesis. We have developed a double transgenic mouse model (K14E6/K14E7 mice) of anal carcinogenesis in which the two oncoproteins are expressed in the stratified squamous epithelium. Topical treatment with the carcinogen dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) induces histologic changes progressing from dysplasia to SCC of the anus. Using this model, we have previously described the up-regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. mTOR is an upstream inhibitor of the protective cellular pathway called autophagy. Autophagy is important in the removal of damaged organelles/proteins through lysosomal degradation to maintain cellular health. The goal of this project is to examine the autophagic response throughout anal carcinogenesis. There are two autophagic proteins that are examined in this proposal, first is LC3 that is attached to the autophagosome membrane and second is the autophagic-specific substrate p62.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Cohorts (3-14 mice/cohort) of K14E6/K14E7 mice were treated topically with DMBA for 5, 10, 15 or 20 weeks. Control mice were not treated with DMBA for the same time points. Anal tissue was collected at the end of treatment, fixed, and serially sectioned. Every 7<sup>th</sup> section was stained with hemotoxylin and eosin and analyzed by a trained pathologist for the presence of dysplasia or SCC. Immunofluorescence (IF) was performed to detect autophagic proteins, LC3 and p62. Electron microscopy (EM) was performed at each time point.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:IF demonstrated an increase in LC3 protein levels throughout neoplastic progression, whereas p62 levels were noted to be high in dysplastic lesions and low in invasive SCC. EM demonstrated an accumulation of lysosomes and mitochondria as lesions progressed from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia, and normalization of lysosome numbers and late autophagosome appearance in SCC.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This study provides evidence of late autophagic flux inhibition during anal carcinogenesis in an HPV mouse model as indicated by increased p62 levels in the setting of increased LC3. This indicates that autophagy is induced, but then the autophagosome is inhibited from fusing to the lysosome resulting in an accumulation of p62. In anal SCC, the levels of p62 expression decreased with the continued increase in LC3 expression, demonstrating that autophagy is able to go to completion in established tumors. These findings support our hypothesis that inhibition of autophagy plays an important role in anal cancer development.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Neuroblastoma tumor-initiating cells have been successfully isolated from patient tumor samples and bone marrow using sphere culture, which is well established to promote growth of neural crest stem cells. However, the mechanisms that are responsible for sphere formation remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that a dedifferentiation program mediates neuroblastoma sphere formation and that more stem cell-like cell lines will form spheres at a higher rate than their more differentiated counterparts.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Four human neuroblastoma cell lines (BE(2)-C, I-type, MYCN amplified; IMR-32, N-type, MYCN amplified; SK-N-SH, S-type, MYCN single copy; SK-N-AS, S-type, MYCN single copy) were examined for intrinsic frequency of sphere formation by limiting dilution analysis in serum-free media supplemented with EGF (20 ng/ml) and bFGF (40 ng/ml). 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA, 5 &micro;M) is clinically used as a differentiating agent for high-risk neuroblastoma. Protein levels were assessed by SDS-PAGE. Multiple group comparisons were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Two group comparisons were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. In all cases a p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Both MYCN amplified and MYCN single copy cell lines formed spheres, contrary to previous reports that this phenotype depended on MYCN amplification. BE(2)-C cells demonstrated the highest frequency of sphere formation and significantly differed from the other 3 cell lines (6.58% vs. 0.7%, 1.5% and 2.26%, p&lt;0.05). bFGF regulated sphere formation in a dose-dependent fashion while EGF did not (20-60 ng/ml, 3-5x fold change, p&lt;0.05). Serial passage in sphere culture conditions increased frequency of sphere formation two fold (p &lt;0.05), and increased expression of the stem cell factor Oct4. The related factor Nanog did not change expression from baseline. 13-cis-RA (5 &micro;M) nearly completely blocked sphere formation in the BE(2)-C cell line (6.58% vs. 0.57%, p&lt;0.05). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: BE(2)-C cells are I-type neuroblastoma cells that have previously been shown to exhibit stem cell features. BE(2)-C is the most avid sphere-forming cell line, and this phenotype is inhibited by induced differentiation with 13-cis-RA. Furthermore, sphere culture affected the expression level of a critical stem cell factor in a manner consistent with previous reports. Hence, the in vitro model system of sphere formation correlates with known parameters of stem cell-like behavior in neuroblastoma and is therefore a valid system for the study of neuroblastoma stem cells.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

The purpose of our study was to: (i) determine expression of pAkt (Ser473), Akt1 and Akt2 in primary and metastatic CRCs, and (ii) develop an effective nanocarrier for lung-selective delivery of pan-PI3K inhibitors as targeted therapy of CRC lung metastasis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  (1) To determine the expression of PI3K/Akt pathway components, we obtained primary CRCs (n=12) and CRC lung metastases (n=10).

The inability of chemotherapy to eradicate quiescent cancer stem cells is a leading hypothesis for cancer recurrence. New therapies that do not rely on cellular proliferation for cytotoxic effect must be developed. The tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells irrespective of cell proliferation, was thought to be such a therapy but the anti-cancer effect identified in preclinical models was not realized in clinical trials due to resistance. Our lab has identified a novel small molecule (ML327) that sensitizes colorectal cancer cell lines to TRAIL. We hypothesize this effect is due to loss of the anti-apoptotic protein c-FLIP, a potent inhibitor of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway initiated by TRAIL.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: CRC cell lines were pre-treated with ML327 or vehicle control at a 10-&mu;M concentration for 24 hours. TRAIL was then added at 100 ng/mL for 4 hours. Cells were lysed and Western blot was performed with antibodies against cFLIP and cleaved caspase 3. Cells were also fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with propidum iodide for FACS analysis. Cells were then treated with ML327 at a 10-&mu;M concentration for up to 4 hours and lysed at hourly increments. Western blot was performed with antibodies against cFLIP.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:24 hours of ML327, but not vehicle, pre-treatment increased TRAIL-induced cleaved caspase 3 protein levels (Fig. A). cFLIP protein level was abundant in vehicle treated cells but was nearly undetectable after 24 hour ML327 treatment (Fig. B). These findings were associated with increased cell death after TRAIL exposure as confirmed by a statistically significant increase (p = 0.002) in the Sub G<sub>0</sub> population on FACS analysis (Fig. C). ML327-induced reductions in cFLIP protein occurred quickly, with reduced levels evident by 1 hour and complete loss by 4 hours (Fig. D).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:ML327 is a novel small molecule that sensitizes CRC cells to the TRAIL ligand as evident by increased apoptosis and subsequent cell death. This sensitization is associated with loss of cFLIP. Ongoing analysis will determine whether this is a cause and effect association and further elucidate the exact mechanism of cFLIP loss. It will be of interest to determine the in vivo efficacy of ML327 induced TRAIL sensitization. With these experiments, we hope to develop a novel therapeutic that will induce cell death in cancer cells irrespective of cell proliferation.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

HNPCC is associated with different clinical manifestations and improved survival but respond poorly to 5-FU based chemotherapy compared to sporadic CC patients.HCT116 is a widely used experimental Dukes' D CC cell line not commonly known to be derived from an HNPCC patient. A molecular characteristic of HNPCC is inherited mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) leading to MSI. We have demonstrated different microRNA (miR) expression patterns between HCT116 and other sporadic CC cell lines with respect to miR-99a. This miR is an established inhibitor of mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR). Increases in mTOR protien have been shown to increase cell growth, proliferation, migration, invasion and decrease apoptosis. Thus miR-99a is a potential pathway for CC treatment and metasistis. We hypothesize the influence of miR-99a on the mTOR pathway, with respect to cell proliferation and motility, is dissimilar between MMR proficient (MMR+) and deficient (MMR-) CC cell lines.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Dukes C and Dukes D MMR- (HCT15, HCT116), MMR+ (HT29, T84) and normal colon epithelium (CCD841) cell lines (ATCC&reg;) were transfected with miR-99a mimic (99M) and a negative control (M).

Chung<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Vanderbilt University Medical Center,Pediatric Surgery,Nashville, TN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogeneous pediatric solid tumor with diverse outcomes ranging from spontaneous regression to clinical progression despite our most aggressive therapies. MYCN-amplifications are common with high-risk NB, a designation that portends &lt;50% survival. Myc-driven tumors are 'glucose addicts' relying predominantly upon glycolysis for energy production even in the presence of adequate oxygen, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. Lactate dehydrogenase is the terminal enzyme of glycolysis. One of its isoforms, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), is preferentially expressed in Myc-driven tumors and avidly converts pyruvate to lactate. FX11 [3-dihydroxy-6-methyl-7-(phenylmethyl)-4-propylnaphthalene-1-carboxylic acid] is a gossypol derivative that selectively inhibits the LDHA isoform and demonstrates preclinical efficacy in C-myc driven pancreatic cancer and lymphomas models. However, the efficacy of FX11 in N-Myc driven NBs is unknown. We hypothesized that MYCN-amplified NBs would be susceptible to LDHA inhibition using FX11.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   We first evaluated the protein expression of LDHA in twelve of our NB cell lines (eight MYCN-amplified and four MYCN-single copy). Two MYCN-amplified cell lines (BE(2)-C and IMR-32) and two MYCN-single copy cell lines (SK-N-SH and SK-N-AS) were used to evaluate the effects of FX11 on NB growth. Cell viability was examined using a tetrazolium-based assay with validation completed by manual cell counts. Immunoblotting for PARP and caspase 3 cleavage products was our measure of apoptosis induction. Lactate concentration was quantified from culture supernatants using a colorimetric assay.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: LDHA was ubiquitously expressed in both MYCN-amplified and MYCN-single copy NB cell lines. Treatment with FX11 (10 &mu;M) significantly decreased the levels of lactate at 6 h, validating that FX11 effectively blocks lactate production in NB cells. Both tetrazolium-based measures and manual cell counts demonstrated that FX11 decreased cell viability of NB cells after three days of treatment in our MYCN-amplified cell lines (BE(2)-C and IMR-32) and four days for MYCN-single copy cell lines (SK-N-SH and SK-N-AS). These time courses coincided with induction of PARP and Caspase 3 cleavage in MYCN-amplified cell lines. Notably, no Caspase 3 products were detectable with FX11 treatment in MYCN-single copy cell lines (Fig.).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: FX11 has comparable in vitro efficacy in MYCN--amplified NBs to those previously reported in C-Myc driven pancreatic and lymphoma models.

Our central hypothesis is that the relative prematurity of patients with NEC puts at them at greater risk of intestinal inflammation due to the underdeveloped nature of their enteric nervous system.  Evidence from our lab and others suggests enteroglia may play a significant role in modulating intestinal inflammatory disorders through the maintenance of gut barrier function.  Specifically, we have found that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid, and FTY720, a known S1P agonist, mitigates intestinal inflmmation.  To more fully understand the link between enteric glia, bioactive lipid signaling and NEC, we are now extending our studies into models of pediatric disease.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using in-vivo approaches involving DSS induced colitis in the mouse model, and in-vitro approaches involving the study of rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells we investigated the putative signaling properties of the bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)--known to cause calcium signaling in enteric glia, which bear its receptors based on our prior studies. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The S1P analog FTY720 (0.3 mg/kg daily by oral gavage) markedly attenuated the inflammatory response induced by 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) by H&amp;E analysis compared with controls in a mouse model of colitis at 3 and 5 days. Cultured rat intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) demonstrated enhanced tight junction formation (Occludin staining and transepithelial resistance) in response to enteric glial cell (EGC)-cultured media within 48 hours. By flow cytometry, Rat EGCs display traditional markers and the Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4). By QPCR, Rat EGCs show diminished expression of TLR4, TNFa, IL-1b, and iNOS response to S1P (1uM) treatment.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our data suggest that the sphingolipid analog FTY720 and S1P have effects upon inflammation in-vivo and in-vitro, respectively.

Here we show that spring-mediated lengthening can be achieved outside the intra-abdominal cavity through a stoma.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using Sprague-Dawley rats, the defunctionalized limb of a Roux-en-y jejunojejunostomy was exteriorized from the peritoneal cavity through a defect created in the anterior abdominal wall (n=8). An encapsulated polycaprolactone spring was placed into the extra-abdominal segment. The stoma containing the spring was secured under the skin to protect it from desiccation and destruction. After 4 weeks, segments were retrieved for histological analyses. Animals who had blank capsules placed in the extra-peritoneal de-functionalized limb served as controls (n=3). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Stomal segments were successfully lengthened from 1.0 cm to 2.5 &plusmn; 0.4 cm, whereas control segments were lengthened from 1.0 cm to 1.5 &plusmn; 0.1 cm (p&lt;0.05). After lengthening, the exteriorized bowel remained viable and patent. Lengthened segments had increased smooth muscle thickness and crypt depth when compared to normal jejunal mucosa. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Spring-mediated mechanical lengthening is not limited to the abdominal cavity. Extra-peritoneal lengthening yields greater than a 2-fold increase in intestinal length. Lengthening through a stoma removes the need to enter the abdomen for subsequent re-lengthening of intestinal segments.","Basic Science","Developmental Biology/Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering","Pediatrics"

Whereas some colonizing bacteria may act as opportunistic pathogens, other bacteria might be innocuous and even protective. In our previous studies, the presence of E. coli CE10 in 4 day old rats negatively correlated with NEC. Here we tested the hypothesis that CE10 is capable of colonizing neonatal rats and protecting them from NEC.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  E. coli CE10 was transformed with a plasmid (pJK_proK14_eGFR) conferring ampicillin resistance and expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Transformed bacteria were introduced to neonatal rats with the first feeding. Afterwards, the animals were subjected to 4 days of the NEC-inducing formula-feeding/hypoxia (FF/H) regimen. NEC was scored histologically. Stool and ileum samples were plated for total bacterial load and the numbers of E. coli C10. The level of apoptosis was analyzed using TUNEL staining and fluorescence microscopy.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: E. coli CE10 established itself as a first colonizer in animals that received it. FF/H alone caused NEC in 60% of neonatal rats. Introduction of E. coli CE10 reduced the incidence of NEC to 39% (p = 0.027). FF/H yielded a higher rate of apoptosis than E. coli CE10 via TUNEL staining. EC was scored histologically. Stool and ileum samples were plated for total bacterial load and the numbers of E. coli C10. The level of apoptosis was analyzed using TUNEL staining and fluorescence microscopy<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: E. coli 07:K1 CE10 is an efficient first colonizer in neonatal rats. CE10 significantly reduced the incidence of NEC. Bacteria similar to this strain can be used for the prophylaxis of NEC.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

This discrepancy may be attributed to high-risk patients presenting with widely disseminated disease, of which only 25% survive despite cytotoxic therapies. Metastatic Nb cells display increased chemoresistance and a hypoxic environment has been shown to dedifferentiate Nb cells to an immature neuroblastic state with rapid growth and cell survival advantage. Our preliminary data demonstrates that hypoxia induces expression of DNA Ligase III (lig3), a mediator of an alternate nonhomologus end-joining (altNHEJ) DNA repair program in Nb cells. Additional work from our laboratory has shown increased expression of this efficient yet error prone repair pathway in tumorigenic Nb cell lines and in tumors of patients with poor survival outcomes. Given this, we hypothesized that induction of altNHEJ confers a survival advantage to Nb cells in hypoxic microenvironments and to standard chemotherapeutic agents.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  S-type Nb cells (SHEP) were divided into three treatment groups and cultured for 1) 72h at 21% O2, 2) 72h at 1% O2, and 3) 72h at 1% O2 followed by 24h reperfusion. Cells were fixed and analyzed by immunocytochemistry (ICC) for gH2AX and lig3 with DAPI mounting solution. Images were generated with fluorescent microscopy at 40x. Quantitative analysis was carried out with ImageJ software, expressed as mean number of foci/nucleus&plusmn;SD. SHEP and IMR32 Nb cells were then cultured under the above conditions with doxorubicin, a standard cytotoxic utilized in Nb treatment (0, 1, 5, and 10&micro;g/mL). Cell viability was determined at 72h by trypan blue exclusion. Lig3 expression was analyzed by ICC as described above. All experiments were repeated in triplicate and statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In hypoxic conditions, Nb cells acquired more DNA damage compared to normoxic controls (0.080&plusmn;0.014 vs. 0.025&plusmn;0.021 gH2AX positive foci/nucleus, p&lt;.05) with decreased overall survival (38%&plusmn;4 vs 78%&plusmn; 12, p&lt;.01). Hypoxic Nb cells had relative resistance to increasing doses of doxorubicin compared to normoxic controls at 1, 5, and 10&micro;g/mL( p&lt;.05). Lig3 expression increased in surviving hypoxic, doxorubicin-treated Nb cells in a dose-dependent manner (p&lt;.0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Lig3, a major DNA repair factor in altNHEJ is activated in hypoxic conditions and confers Nb cell survival advantage to Doxorubicin.

The aim of this study was to assess lung development during AP support.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Institutional guidelines for animal research were followed.  AP lambs of estimated gestational ages 116-120 days (term=145 days) were cannulated for VV-ECLS (internal jugular vein drainage and umbilical vein reinfusion) on placental support and delivered.  They were intubated and the endotracheal tube filled with fluid and clamped (n=3) or held at a constant pressure of 8cmH<sub>2</sub>O (n=2).  Tissue control (TC) animals were delivered and immediately euthanized.  These were divided into early gestational age (115-122 days, n=4) and later gestational age (123-129 days, n=3).  A bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained during necropsy on all animals and spun down to remove the solid cell component.

Intersectin 1 (ITSN1) protein is involved in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, which has been shown to stabilize the MYCN oncogenic transcription factor. Silencing ITSN1 in vitro significantly reduced the anchorage-independent growth of neuroblastoma cells. We hypothesize that silencing ITSN1 with shRNA in neuroblastoma cells leads to decreased tumor growth in an orthotopic mouse model.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We have previously created stable SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cell lines with empty vector (pSR) and vector that contains scrambled shRNA (pSCR), that served as control lines, or vector that contains shRNAs to ITSN1 (Sh#1 and Sh#2). Orthotopic neuroblastoma tumors of each cell line were established in three immunocompromised mice by injecting 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells directly into the adrenal gland.  Tumor volume was monitored weekly with ultrasound, using tumor volume &gt;1000mm<sup>3 </sup>as the end point.  Harvested tumors were analyzed with anti-ITSN1 antibody on Western blot. Tumor growth was analyzed using Kaplan Meier curves and student's T-test, with p&lt;0.05 deemed statistically significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Orthotopic tumors were successfully created in all cell lines. At day 25-post injection, tumor size for pSR was 1235.7&plusmn;761.2mm<sup>3</sup>, pSCR was 1311.4&plusmn;296.5mm<sup>3</sup>, Sh#1 was 574.4&plusmn; 539.9mm<sup>3</sup>, Sh#2 was 439.5&plusmn;95.3mm<sup>3</sup>.  Sh#2 was significantly smaller than pSCR (p=0.027), and there was a trend toward significance that Sh#1 was smaller than pSCR (p=0.13).  Overall survival was superior in Sh#2, 31&plusmn;1.7 days, compared to pSCR, 25&plusmn;0 days (p=0.025).  Again, a trend towards overall survival in Sh#1, 31&plusmn;7.2 days, compared to pSCR, 25&plusmn;0 days (p= 0.11).  There was no difference in tumor growth between pSR with the other groups, likely due to high variance within this group, overall survival of 29.67&plusmn;14.1 days.  Western blot analysis of the harvested tumor showed decreased ITSN1 expression in experimental groups Sh#1 and Sh#2 compared to the control groups pSR and pSCR.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Silencing ITSN1 expression in neuroblastoma cells leads to decreased tumor growth in vivo. We demonstrate that orthotopic animal models can serve as an authentic 'read out' of molecular manipulation of ITSN1 signaling in vitro. Thus, understanding the role of ITSN1 signaling pathways in tumor development may provide new insight into neuroblastoma tumorigenesis.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

Our laboratory recently described a novel surgical mouse model of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and rescued the IUGR phenotype using intraplacental adenovirus mediated gene transfer of human insulin-like growth factor-1 (Ad-IGF-1). Mouse birthweight, growth trajectory, glucose tolerance and blood pressure correct to control levels. The mechanism by which fetal reprogramming occurs has yet to be fully elucidated. We hypothesize that Ad-IGF-1 intraplacental gene transfer restores the bioavailability of serum levels of IGF-1 in IUGR pups.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In time-mated e18 C57/BL6J dams, one of two naturally occurring mesenteric uterine artery branches were ligated in one pup (excluding the pups at the uterine ends), inducing IUGR (n=3). Control pups were those with dual arteries on the opposite uterine horn as well as sham-operated pups (n=5). A subset of IUGR pups (n=3) received 5 ul intraplacental injections of 1x10^8 pfu adenovirus expressing human IGF-1 after artery ligation. Serum samples were obtained by decapitation of the pups following delivery via hysterotomy at e20. Serum and placenta homogenate levels of mouse IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were measured in duplicate by ELISA. Bioavailability of IGF-1 was defined as the molar ratio of IGF-1 to IGFBP-3. Statistical analysis was by Student's T-test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Serum levels of bioavailable IGF-1 were significantly reduced in IUGR pups compared to controls (P=0.01) and were restored with Ad-IGF-1 gene transfer (p&gt;0.05).

Chemokine (C-C) ligand 3 (CCL3 or macrophage inflammatory protein-1a, MIP-1a) and Interleukin-12 (IL-12) are key chemokines/cytokines in this process.  CCL3, a chemokine, recruits immune cells such as monocytes and neutrophils to the site of injury and induces the release of other pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). IL-12, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, recruits and activates immune cells including T cells and NK cells.. We hypothesized that CCL3 and IL-12 expression in the ileum might be increased in the context of NEC-associated inflammation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to groups by litter. CONTROLS were delivered vaginally and dam-fed. NEC groups were delivered by C-section 12 hours prematurely, formula fed, exposed to intermittent cold and hypoxia, and given a single oral dose of lipopolysaccharide. Ileum samples were obtained at 0, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours of life and western blots were performed with antibodies against CCL3, IL-12, and b-actin for normalization by individual animal. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-way ANOVA and a priori P&lt;0.05.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Ileal CCL3 and IL-12 protein expression (see Figure) in NEC was below Control levels at 24 hours, but increased at 72 hours versus Controls (*P&lt;0.05).

Chung<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Vanderbilt University Medical Center,Pediatric Surgery,Nashville, TN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Neuroblastoma is responsible for nearly 15% of all pediatric cancer-related deaths and remains a difficult pediatric solid tumor to cure. Acute tumor hypoxia in neuroblastoma is known to promote dedifferentiation and drug resistance in part by stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1&alpha; and HIF-2&alpha; ) which function as key drivers of glycolysis, and has been well characterized. Chronic tumor cell hypoxia is also likely to exist in aggressive solid tumors such as neuroblastoma, yet its exact role in tumorigenicity remains poorly understood. We hypothesize that chronic hypoxia is a microenvironmental stress stimulus that plays a critical role in driving neuroblastoma progression. The aim of this study was to establish an in vitro model of chronic hypoxia to assess neuroblastoma cell growth.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Human neuroblastoma cell lines, BE(2)-C (MYCN-amplified) and SK-N-SH (MYCN-single copy), were cultured in 1% ambient oxygen for 1, 3, 7, or 10 d. Post-hypoxia cell viability was assessed over a time course (0 to 96 h) using CCK-8 assay. Soft agar colony formation after 2 weeks incubation in 0.4%/0.8% agarose gel was used to assess anchorage-independent growth. SDS-PAGE was used to assess protein expression. Two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis and a p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Ten days of 1% O<sub>2</sub> increased the proliferative capacity of both cell lines compared to controls cultured at ambient O<sub>2</sub> (p &lt;0.01 for each individual comparison). Specifically, MYCN--single copy SK-N-SH cells demonstrated a two-fold increase in proliferation following 10 d exposure to 1% O<sub>2</sub> compared to controls cultured in 21% O<sub>2</sub>. A more modest increase (1.5-fold) was observed in the MYCN-amplified BE(2)-C cells. Anchorage-independent growth was also observed in both BE(2)-C and SK-N-SH cells cultured for 10 d at 1% O<sub>2</sub>. The well-established mediators of the acute hypoxic response HIF-1&alpha; and HIF-2&alpha; were both upregulated by 1 d as expected, validating the hypoxia culture chamber. Interestingly, expression levels of both factors returned to basal levels by 10 d of continuous hypoxic exposure. Hexokinase-1 and lactate dehydrogenase-A, two downstream markers of glycolytic flux, were similarly decreased at 10 d of continuous exposure to 1% O<sub>2</sub>.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Neuroblastoma is a pediatric solid tumor with significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity featuring areas of necrosis and hemorrhage that may implicate chronic hypoxia as a key microenvironmental regulator of tumor progression. Our model shows that prolonged continuous exposure to subnormal oxygen levels induces a phenotype that enhances both cellular proliferation and anchorage independent growth. This behavioral change appears to be both a HIF- and glycolysis-independent phenomenon.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

Their sequelae are staggering &amp; appear not only to have anatomical effects, but also functional, emotional &amp; psychological morbidities including bladder &amp; bowel incontinence, paralysis, musculoskeletal deformity, &amp; shunt malfunctions &amp; infections. Ultimately, its compound nature results in an immense financial burden amounting to $1,400,000. The morbidity &amp; mortality associated with having a NTD is secondary not only to ongoing spinal cord injury as a result of prolonged mechanical trauma to the neural elements, but also chemical inflammation associated with exposure to amniotic fluid. Currently, pre-natal repair is performed relatively late, around 22-26 weeks of gestation &amp; is associated with a 50% reduction in the need for ventriculoperitoneal shunting. However, it is associated with an increased risk to both mother &amp; fetus including premature labor &amp; prematurity among others. Reverse Thermal Gels are a group of biomimetic polymers that can undergo reversible phase transition from liquid to physical gel upon temperature change without the need for reactive species or outside energy sources making them suitable for biological use.

Degradation in both human &amp; sheep amniotic fluid was studied using Gel Permeation Chromatography. Finally, proliferation of murine embryonic fibroblasts was measured using an MTT proliferation assay kit.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our polymer possesses a unique surface ultrastructure dictated by concentration and is tied to its biological properties. A 15% m/v sample has smaller pore sizes when compared to 10% &amp; 13% samples. Permeability to fluorescein is predictable and depends on the pore sizes. At 1 day, 10% m/v polymer is more permeable to fluorescein than 13% &amp; 15%. However, after 8 days, it is equivalent. There is minimal permeability to albumin. The polymer does not degrade in neither human nor sheep amniotic fluid for up to 30 days. Finally, compared to control media, murine embryonic fibroblasts possess a similar proliferation profile when subjected to polymer extract. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our polymer is stable in amniotic fluid and possesses a unique ultrastructure and functional characteristics that supports its use as an innovative bioengineering approach to open fetal repair of NTDs.","Basic Science","Developmental Biology/Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering","Pediatrics"

Lack of representative animal models is a challenge in clarifying the pathogenesis of NEC.  In depth molecular analysis of human tissue is hence required for understanding the mechanisms involved in NEC development.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Six premature infants that had a surgical resection for NEC and 6 age-matched ileal atresia controls were identified from the medical records.  RNA was isolated from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using the Rneasy FFPE kit from Qiagen.  RNA quality was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer and by performing reverse transcription real time PCR analysis of housekeeping genes (GAPDH and 18S).  Only RNA that exhibited good quality with both methods was used for microarray analysis.  Gene expression analysis by microarray was then performed with the Illumina HT-12_V4 chip.   A subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was then done to identify top canonical pathways and regulators involved.  All studies were done in accordance after approval by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board.   <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Greater than 47,000 genes were screened.

Warner<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Washington University,Pediatric Surgery,St. Louis, MO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Following massive small bowel resection (SBR), an important programmed compensatory process takes place in the remaining bowel termed adaptation. This adaptive response is characterized by increased enterocyte proliferation leading to taller villi, deeper crypts, and an expanded mucosal surface area. The magnitude of adaptation is regulated at least in part by intact epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Recently, we have found that adaptation is also associated with diminished oxygen delivery, increased hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF1&alpha;) expression, and subsequent enhanced angiogenesis within the villi and submucosal layer in the remnant bowel. The aim of this study is to elucidate the potential role for EGFR signaling as a regulator of HIF1&alpha; expression in both enterocytes and endothelial cells. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Rat Intestinal Epithelial Cells (RIEC) and Human Intestinal Endothelial Cells (HIMEC) were serum-starved for 24 hours. The cells were then treated with either EGF (50ng/ml) alone, EGF plus EGFR inhibitors (Geftinib (ZD1839) or Analinoquinazolin (AG1478)) or the EGFR inhibitors alone for 1 hour. This was followed by a period of either normoxia or hypoxia (0.5 % Fi02) for another 4 hours. Cells were washed and harvested directly into 1X SDS sample loading buffer.   A Western blot was then performed to assess the effects of EGFR signaling manipulation and expressions of HIF1&alpha; in these cell lines<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  HIF1&alpha; expression could be detected only under hypoxic condition in both epithelial and endothelial cells.  EGFR is activated at both normoxia and hypoxia conditions as demonstrated by EGFR phosphorylation in both cells. EGFR inhibitors effectively diminished EGFR  and MAP-Kinase activity in both normoxia and hypoxia cells upon EGF stimulation. Interestingly HIF1&alpha; expression is also reduced in those cells with blunted EGFR activation.        <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  EGFR signaling appears to play a role in the stimulation of HIF1&alpha; expression in both enterocytes and endothelial cells.

Gourlay<sup>1</sup>  <sup>2</sup>Children's Hospital Of Wisconsin,Neonatology,Milwaukee, WI, USA <sup>1</sup>Children's Hospital Of Wisconsin,Pediatric Surgery,Milwaukee, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) is an enzyme secreted from the mucosa of the gut which exerts a number of beneficial effects on the gut, including the enhancement of barrier function, reducing excessive inflammation, maintaining commensal bacteria and detoxifies lipopolysaccharide.  The premature gut has a permeable intestinal barrier and an immature microbiome which predispose the premature neonate to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).  Minimal research has focused on the activity of IAP in the premature gut, thus we sought to determine normal IAP activity levels for premature infants. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is an observational prospective trial involving 10 neonates, ranging in age from 26 to 37 weeks estimated gestational age, in the neonatal intensive care unit at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW).  Inclusion criteria included: capable of per rectum stooling, parents/guardians consent to the study, and born at or transferred to CHW within 72 hours of life.  Patients were excluded if they had life threatening congenital anomalies, congenital intestinal obstruction, or colostomy/ileostomy due to causes other than NEC.  If possible, the first stool was collected and then weekly thereafter.  The stool was homogenized and the amount of protein per volume determined.  An AP activity assay was performed using a p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) colorimetric assay.  Absorbance of all samples was measured in triplicate at 405nM.  The AP activity was measured in the presence of IAP and tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase inhibitors.  A standard curve of pNPP dilutions was used to quantify the amount of AP activity. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  AP activity in all stool samples of premature infants is almost completely inhibited by phenylalanine, an IAP specific inhibitor, but minimally inhibited by a tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase inhibitor.  This cohort of premature infants has a heterogeneous amount of AP activity.  For the majority of patients, there is a substantial drop in the AP activity beginning at approximately day of life 4.  This decline was followed by an increase in AP activity over the following 2-3 weeks which generally reached and just exceeded the AP activity in the first stool.  Only one patient, who had stool samples at the appropriate time points, did not follow this trend of increasing AP activity after an initial drop and this patient was being treated with meropenem for bacteremia. <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:  AP activity in the stool of premature infants is almost exclusively due to IAP as it is inhibited by phenylalanine.  The activity of IAP, while initially higher, declines rapidly within days of birth and then rises slowly over the following 3 weeks.  The relatively high initial level of AP activity could explain the decreased incidence of NEC in the early postnatal period.  Larger studies will be necessary to determine if the heterogeneity of the baseline IAP levels has a physiologic significance.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

Ford<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Children's Hospital Los Angeles,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) affects premature infants and its etiology remains largely unknown. Colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal (GI) tract with opportunistic pathogens, such as Coronobacter muytjensii, is thought to be a prime initiating event. Opportunistic pathogens compromise the gut barrier, leading to bacterial translocation, inflammation, and, ultimately, intestinal necrosis. Lactobacillus biotics have been shown in a number of studies to protect against NEC. However, results of Lactobacillus trials remain inconclusive due to the use of different species/strains and doses in different trials.  Moreover, an important question of whether the lactobacilli used as probiotics are colonizing the intestine remains unanswered. We propose that an efficient probiotic strain should not only protect the intestinal epithelium, but should also be capable of colonizing the GI tract. To identify naturally occurring colonizing lactobacilli, we sought to isolate and characterize the strains of this genus in the intestines of 4 day old rats. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Animal experiments were approved by CHLA IACUC. Neonates were obtained from timed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats purchased from Charles River or Harlan Labs. The neonates were kept in a temperature and humidity controlled incubator, and fed with formula for 4 days. Care was taken not to introduce extraneous bacteria during handling and feeding. To enumerate and isolate the lactobacilli, the content of the large intestine was serially diluted and plated on MRS agar. After 2 day incubation at 37<sup>o</sup>C, the emerging colonies were classified according to their appearance, and numbers in each class counted. Pure cultures were established for each class and maintained as frozen stocks. The lactobacilli were identified as Gram+ or Gram+/- non-spore-forming rods. The species identity was established by sequencing a variable region of the 16S rRNA gene and by biochemical tests. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Seven morphologically unique strains of lactobacilli were isolated from 138 rat pups belonging to 18 litters (Figure 1). Among the identified species, there were L. reuteri and L. murinus. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Various lactobacilli are common first GI tract colonizers in neonatal rats. Availability of the pure cultures of the natural colonizing Lactobacillus strains will allow us to experimentally evaluate their ability to colonize the intestine and protect against NEC.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) may have an important role in neonatal intestinal vascular development and control. We hypothesized that the gene and protein dysregulation that occurs during experimental NEC results in altered VEGFR-2 protein expression.   <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly separated into NEC and CONTROL groups by litter.  NEC groups were delivered by C-section 12 hrs prematurely, formula fed, exposed to intermittent cold and hypoxia, and given a single oral dose of lipopolysaccharide (n=95). CONTROLs were delivered vaginally and dam-fed. Ileum samples were obtained at 0, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours of life and Western blots were performed with antibodies against VEGFR-2 and &beta; -actin for normalization by individual animal. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-way ANOVA and a priori P&lt;0.05.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In NEC animals, ileal VEGFR-2 levels increase markedly from the 0 time point, peaking at 24 hours, before returning to baseline levels at 96 hours of life (see Figure 1).  In the CONTROL animals, ileal VEGFR-2 concentration was significantly lower than in NEC animals until 96 hours of life.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: VEGFR-2 is the major signaling receptor for VEGFA, the vasoactive form of VEGF. In this experimental model of NEC, VEGFR-2 expression is increased in NEC compared to CONTROL animals, suggesting dysfunction in this intestinal microvascular angiogenesis pathway.  When coupled with alterations in VEGFA levels in NEC, this could provide an explanation for vascular dysfunction and poor intestinal perfusion in NEC.","Basic Science","Developmental Biology/Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering","Pediatrics"

A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare HP/MF groups with each other and with a larger data pool encompassing a wide range of surgical diagnoses to obtain alpha and beta-diversity. Weighted and unweighted UniFRAc distances were calculated using permanova and anosim tests. UniFRAc distances were measured between the HP or MF (5 pairs each) and the specimen in continuity with the same patient's fecal stream.

Despite recent therapeutic advances, about 60 % of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma experience relapse.  The carcinogenic mechanisms driving these cancers are poorly understood, so advances in this area are much needed.  The transcription factor ASCL1 is expressed in the early stages of neurogenesis and plays an important role in neuronal fate determination.  It has been shown to be highly expressed in neuroendocrine tumors, including neuroblastoma.  Results from the overexpression (in non-endocrine airway epithelial cells of transgenic mice) and depletion (in lung cancer cells) of ASCL1 suggest an oncogenic role for this protein.  Its downregulation may therefore be a potential treatment strategy for neuroblastoma.  In this study, we examined the biological consequences of ASCL1 depletion in neuroblastoma cells.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  NGP cells were transfected with a doxycycline-inducible shRNA sequence against ASCL1 to create an NGP-ASCL1 knockdown (KD) cell line.  As a control, non-specific, no-target scrambled sequence containing plasmid was transfected.  These cells were selected on puromycin media.  Western analysis was used to study the effects of doxycycline treatment on levels of ASCL1, apoptotic proteins, and neuroendocrine tumor markers for up to eight days.  The proliferation of both control and doxycycline-treated cells was measured by MTT assay.   <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Doxycycline treatment induced RFP expression and decreased ASCL1 protein levels in NGP-ASCL1 KD cells.  The amount of ASCL1 reduction was dependent on the amount of doxycycline added to the media.  ASCL1 knockdown was associated with decreased cellular proliferation at the 4 day (21 % reduction, p=.005), 6 day (48 %, p=.001), and 8 day (61 %, p&lt;.001) time points.  Knockdown cells also exhibited lower levels of the neuroendocrine tumor marker CgA, the cell cycle driver cyclin D1, and the pro-survival proteins Mcl1 and survivin.       <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The controlled system we have developed for regulated expression of ASCL1 allows direct analysis of loss?of?function, with ASCL1 reduction being dependent on the amount of doxycycline added to the media.  ASCL1 knockdown in NGP neuroblastoma cells inhibits their proliferative abilities, apparently through an apoptotic pathway.

Intestinal ischemia leads to pathophysiological disruption that typically presents as increased fluid secretion into the lumen of the intestine with increased levels of ischemia. The aim of this study was to understand the fluid alterations that occur with intestinal ischemia, and determine if FITC-Inulin measurement is sensitive to measure the changes in fluid movement across an intact rat intestinal graft as a real-time measurement of ischemic injury. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Male Sprague Dawley rats (average weight of 400g) were operated on in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University. Two 10 cm small intestine segments were procured from the rats. The intestinal segments were cleansed with HEPES (pH: 7.40, Osmolarity 300&plusmn;5 at 37&deg;C) solution to clear remaining intestinal contents. The intestinal segments were connected to customized intestinal chambers that are part of a perfusion device. The chambers were kept in a water bath maintained at 37&deg;C. Both intestines were perfused on the vascular side with HEPES buffer solution (pH: 7.40, Osmolarity 300&plusmn;5 at 37&deg;C). The control HEPES reservoir was open to air, while the experimental reservoir was sealed and bubbled with 100% Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) to mimic an ischemic environment. Inside both lumens, 3ml of HEPES containing 50 &micro;M FITC-Inulin was continuously perfused at a rate of 1ml/min. Intraluminal samples of the perfusates were collected at three 30 minutes' intervals to measure FITC-Inulin concentration using a nanospectrofluorimeter.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:When comparing measurements of FITC-Inulin in both intestines, there was a mean 37% reduction of FITC-Inulin concentration in the control versus a mean 57% reduction in the experimental arm, thus indicating increased fluid secretion that was stimulated by the ischemic environment.  After examining and comparing the ischemic with the control tissue, an approximate doubling of the amount of secretion was observed over the same time period. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:FITC-Inulin can be used effectively as a volume marker that equates to the ischemic state of the intestinal tissue. This is a practical method to measure real time fluid changes inside a small intestine graft.

The objective of this study was first to establish an ex vivo assay of bandage adhesion to liver and then to test our hypothesis that use of FG containing recombinant Factor XIII (rFXIII) would improve the adhesion strength (AS) of bandage glued to liver compared to FG without rFXIII.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Customized FG (0.2 mL; 9 mg/mL plasma-derived fibrinogen, pdFI, + 106 U/mL r-thrombin + 0.36 mg/mL rFXIII) or commercial FG (0.2 mL Tisseel; Baxter), an FG that contains ~75 mg/mL pdFI and only trace pdFXIII, was applied to a 1&times;2 cm interface between custom electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) mesh and a fresh porcine liver strip, and the interface was compressed with a 170 g weight for 5 min at 37&deg;C (default setup). A T-peel adhesion test was performed with an Instron 5943 tensiometer with a 10 N load cell. Force vs. displacement data were used to calculate AS (N/cm), defined as average force during the peel divided by the interface width. AS data were compared with ANOVA (&alpha;&lt;0.05) and unpaired t-tests (p&lt;0.05).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Using the default setup, AS of custom FG was ~2-fold greater by gluing the PCL mesh to the capsular surface of the liver vs. raw parenchyma (Fig. 1A), so use of the liver capsule was incorporated into the default setup. Neither capsular surface wetness (patted dry vs. pre-wet with PBS) nor prolonged compression time (5 vs. 10 min) affected AS (Fig. 1B). There appeared to be decreased AS with lower temperature during compression (25 vs. 37?C), but this was not significant (Fig. 1B). Decreasing FG volume by 50% (0.05 vs. 0.1 mL/cm<sup>2</sup>) resulted in a lower AS (Fig. 1B). Increasing FG volume beyond 0.1 mL/cm<sup>2</sup> was ineffective secondary to glue spillage during compression. Removing rFXIII from the default setup decreased AS by ~50%, but doubling the [rFXIII] did not increase AS (Fig. 1C). AS of customized FG vs. commercial FG was not different (Fig. 1C).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:An ex vivo adhesion test of synthetic resorbable mesh applied to porcine liver with customized FG was optimized with respect to liver surface qualities, adhesion compression time and temperature, and FG quantity. AS was augmented by rFXIII in the FG. The customized FG produced AS similar to that of commercial FG, despite the former having only ~1/8 the pdFI. The AS equivalence between these two FGs likely was a result of the added rFXIII to the customized FG, suggesting that efficacy testing of rFXIII addition to biologic hemostatic devices may be warranted.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

The primary mediators of these phenotypes are tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a driving force behind hyperfibrinolysis, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor that couples tPA nullifying its physiologic effect. Endothelial cells activate during stress and are capable of releasing tPA and PAI-1, but their role in critically injured patients remains unclear. Thrombin is a key agent which can stimulate shutdown or enhancement of fibrinolysis. While it is known that tPA is stored in Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelium, the timing and source of PAI-1 remains unclear. We hypothesize that thrombin causes PAI-1 release from preformed vesicles in endothelium thus serving as a rapid counter-regulation of tPA release.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (HLSECs) were grown to an 80-90% confluence in wells after passage 3. HLSECs were treated with thrombin at a concentration of 5units/ml known to be present in the plasma of trauma patients. Supernatant samples were collected at 15 and 30 minute timepoints. Each timepoint was run in duplicate. The supernatants were analyzed with ELISAs for total (free) tPA, total (free) PAI-1, and tPA-PAI-1 complex.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Thrombin-stimulated endothelial cells released more PAI-1 than the control (&gt;600ng/ml for thrombin 15 min and 30 min vs 441ng/ml control). Free tPA was lower in the thrombin treated cells (0.781ng/ml at 15m, 0.617ng/ml at 30m, 0.977ng/ml control). tPA-PAI-1 complex values were slightly higher from the control at 15min and lower at 30min for the thrombin-treated cells (10.95ng/ml for 15m, 8.56ng/ml for 30m, and 10.2ng/ml control). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Thrombin provokes the rapid release of PAI-1 from hepatic endothelium with the subsequent formation of tPA-PAI-1 complexes causing a decrease in free tPA and an increase in PAI-1 resulting in fibrinolysis shutdown.

Succinate receptors are highly expressed on platelets and dysfunctional platelets play a pivotal role in trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC). However, the contribution of post-shock succinate accumulation to platelet-mediated TIC is unknown. Fibrinolysis is an important cause of early post-traumatic death due to hemorrhage, yet the mechanism driving acute platelet/fibrin clot failure remains elusive. We hypothesize that succinate alters platelet function, accelerating fibrinolysis, at plasma concentrations observed during hemorrhagic shock.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Venous whole blood (WB) from healthy individuals (n=8) was mixed with 5&mu;l of succinate solution to achieve 250-1000&mu;M concentrations per 500&mu;l of WB. Tissue plasminogen activator (75ng/mL, +tPA) was added at each concentration to simulate post-shock endogenous tPA release. Samples were analyzed using native thromboelastography (TEG) and functional fibrinogen (measurement of clot formation independent of platelets, FF-TEG) assays. Repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment was used to determine statistically significant change from baseline TEG and FF-TEG parameters at increasing succinate concentration &plusmn; tPA.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Elevated succinate concentrations (&plusmn;tPA) decreased time to clot initiation (R), while increasing clot potentiation (angle) and the maximum amplitude of clot formation (MA) (R 250&mu;M+tPA vs. R WB+tPA, p=0.026; angle 500&mu;M+tPA vs. angle WB+tPA, p=0.004; MA 500&mu;M+tPA vs. MA WB+tPA, p=0.026, Figure 1). tPA independently decreased R and increased angle (R WB+tPA vs. R WB, p=0.016; angle WB+tPA vs. angle WB, p=0.016); however these effects were more profound in the setting of succinate (R +tPA vs. R succinate+tPA, -33% vs. -51%, p=0.042; angle +tPA vs. angle succinate+tPA, +37% vs. +67%, p=0.001). Functional fibrinogen levels (FLEV) were unchanged by elevated tPA and succinate concentration &plusmn; tPA. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Pathophysiologic concentrations of succinate in whole blood accelerate clot initiation and potentiation, precipitating earlier tPA-mediated fibrinolysis. Functional fibrinogen levels, measuring clot formation independent of platelets, are unchanged by increasing succinate (&plusmn; tPA), implicating platelets as culprit mediators. These data support succinate's role in a platelet-dependent mechanism that drives early post-shock hyperfibrinolysis.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

An<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Chicago,Surgery,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:   Acinetobacter baumannii is a microbe of growing importance in trauma related soft tissue infections (STIs), and is currently one of the most common causes of late mortality following combat injuries.  It has also become a significant cause of multi-drug resistant infection in the intensive care setting. Injury and ischemia have been shown to enhance A. baumannii virulence, both directly and by altering the fitness function of any microbes present in the wound. Characterizing for the ecological dynamics of host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) in the wound milieu will provide insight into tipping points that lead to A. baumannii STIs (AbSTIs). Towards this end we have adapted a prior agent-based model (ABM) of STI to incorporate virulence activation mechanisms of A. baumannii in order to characterize the dynamics of wound HPI and identify conditions that promote AbSTI.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Our prior muscle wound ABM (MWABM) was extended by adding known A. baumannii virulence mechanisms and host tissue responses to hypoxia and inflammation. The resulting ABM incorporates muscles cells, neutrophils, macrophages, avirulent commensal bacteria, and the detailed representation of A. baumannii.  Parameter sweeps were performed to evaluate dynamic patterns of of injury, microbial community composition, virulence activation and host mediator levels in relation to the generation of non-healing and the development of AbSTI. Simulation interventions included differing levels of wound debridement and topical antibiotic therapy. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Simulation experiments identified a series of interconnected thresholds of microbial population composition, degree of initial injury and residual damaged tissue leading to AbSTIs.  We demonstrated the role of free iron in the activation of virulence in relation to A. baumannii's ability to sequester iron via siderophore production.  Decreased free iron increased accumulation of HIF1&alpha; and decreased iNOS dimerization, which improved with greater debridement. Paradoxically, early topical antibiotic therapy demonstrated decreased microbial populations but increased relative rates of AbSTIs, suggesting the importance of microbial ecological suppression of A. baumannii virulence.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  The modified MWABM effectively provides dynamic knowledge representation of A. baumannii virulence in the pathogenesis of AbSTI, demonstrating the effect of debridement, and also the unexpected result that topical antibiotic therapy may have adverse microbial ecological effects on the development of AbSTIs. These findings suggest the importance of incorporating intact microbial communities in future experimental wound healing STI studies in order to make them more clinically relevant. This type of model can serve as a framework to add more detailed mechanistic knowledge as well as investigate novel anti-virulence strategies.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

We have shown that Thailandepsin-A (TDP-A), a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, can induce apoptosis in carcinoid tumor cells in vitro and reduce tumor size in vivo. However, treatment with TDP-A alone achieved only cytostatic effect. The suppression of anti-apoptotic proteins with concomitant TDP-A treatment could induce cytotoxic effect of both drugs. Therefore, our goal was to investigate a potential synergistic effect on apoptosis in carcinoid cells in vitro with dual treatment of TDP-A and siRNA silencing of three different anti-apoptotic markers, cyclin D1, MCL1 and BCL2.<br><br><strong>Method</strong>:  siRNA of three anti-apoptotic oncogenes, cyclin D1, MCL1 and BCL2, were transfected into gastrointestinal carcinoid cells (BON) using Lipofectamine. Treatment with TDP-A 7 nM (previously tested IC<sub>50 </sub>value of the drug) occurred 4 hours following siRNA transfection. Cells were incubated for 48 hours before harvesting. qRT-PCR analysis was completed to assess the efficiency of siRNA silencing and flow cytometry was analyzed to determine the apoptotic induction.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In flow cytometric analysis, we assessed pre-apoptotic and apoptotic percentages of total cells after 48 hours of treatment with either siRNA alone, TDP-A alone or siRNA and TDP-A. Figure 1A represents a summary of pre-apoptotic and apoptotic percentages of total cells observed in all samples. We observed a synergistic induction of apoptosis when MCL1 siRNA and TDP-A were applied concurrently. Figure 1B depicts flow cytometric images visualizing the synergistic induction of apoptosis.  For qRT-PCR, we observed reduction in relative gene expression in all target genes following transfection of siRNA as compared to scrambled siRNA transfection.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While BCL2 and cyclin D1 siRNA did indeed knock down the expression of their target genes, no synergistic induction of apoptosis occurred with the treatment of both the siRNA and TDP-A. However, combined MCL1 siRNA and TDP-A treatment resulted in a synergistic induction of apoptosis in BON carcinoid cells. These results suggest selective gene silencing of MCL1 enhanced TDP-A induced apoptosis in carcinoid cells in vitro, and warrants further investigation into the relationship between MCL1 knockdown and concomitant treatment of TDP-A.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","General Surgery"

We have previously shown that increased fibroblast age is associated with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. Recent evidence suggests that one of the most important regulatory factors of protein production are microRNAs. One such microRNA, microRNA-146a (miR-146a), regulates the inflammatory response by suppressing interleukin-8 (IL-8). Epigenetic regulation such as histone modification has been implicated as a modulatory factor in microRNA expression.  We hypothesize that differentially expressed miR-146a in different age groups is under epigenetic control, and that the increased production of proinflammatory cytokines by fibroblasts with increasing age may be due to decreased expression of miR-146a.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   With IRB approval, we isolated fibroblasts from the discarded foreskin of young (&lt;1 month of age) or old (&gt;6 months) males undergoing elective circumcision.  Fibroblasts were isolated and expanded no more than 5 passages.  Young or old fibroblasts were then cultured for 24 hours with or without two different pan Histone Deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) conditions: suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA), or Apicidin. Total cellular RNA was isolated.  Expression of IL-8 and miR-146a was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis.  Expression at baseline and following HDACi treatment was compared to vehicle (DMSO) control.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Young fibroblasts had significantly decreased IL-8 gene expression compared to the older fibroblasts.  Young fibroblasts also had significantly increased miR-146a expression compared to older fibroblasts. Treatment with an HDACi resulted in an increase in miR-146a expression in both young and old fibroblasts.  In addition, expression of IL-8 was significantly decreased in the older fibroblasts under both HDACi treatment conditions (SAHA p &lt; 0.01, Apicidin p &lt; 0.05).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  These findings identify age specific molecular mechanism(s) that modulate the inflammatory response. Increased inflammation and subsequent scar tissue formation with increasing age may be due to decreased expression of miR-146a.  Our results also indicated that anti-inflammatory miR-146a is differentially expressed with age, and that the mechanism governing this differential expression may be under epigenetic control. Further studies are warranted to examine miR-146a as a potential therapeutic target to modulate the inflammatory response, and decrease the complications of fibrosis and scar formation.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","General Surgery"

MYCN amplification is directly related to poor tumor prognosis and has been previously shown to attenuate RGS5, a regulator of G-protein signaling involved in tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis. It has been previously shown that a decrease in RGS5 expression has been associated with increased tumor aggressiveness. Next Generation sequencing has enabled many advancements in cancer research and has enabled researchers to look at potential cancer markers to help further stratify how cell types react to treatments. We hypothesize that MYCN amplification correlates with RGS5 expression.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: To test this hypothesis we performed Next-Generation Sequencing on IMR-32 (MYCN amplified) cell line as well as MYCN knockdown in the same cell line. Next, total cellular RNA was isolated from the human neuroblastoma pre-treatment cell lines (SK-N-Be(1), SMS-KAN, IMR32) and post-treatment cell lines (LA-N-6, SK-N-As, SK-N-FI). The pre-treatment cell lines have overexpression of MYCN.  The expression of RGS5 was measured using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Utilizing Next Generation sequencing, we demonstrated that the expression of RGS5 in MYCN amplified cell lines showed attenuated expression when compared to post-treatment cell lines where MYCN was non-amplified. The qPCR data using both pre and post-treatment cell lines followed the same pattern and showed that RGS5 expression was decreased in the MYCN amplified pre-treatment lines.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:RGS5 is differentially expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines with and without MYCN amplification. There is an inverse correlation of MYCN and RGS5, which follows the theory that low levels of RGS5 and high MYCN expression lead to a worse prognosis. It has been shown that RGS5 works in many cell growth, metastatic, and neovascularization pathways. This work further correlates the connection between expression of MYCN and RGS5. Because RGS5 expression levels are increased in post-treatment cell lines, RGS5 could serve in the future as a possible marker to further stratify and characterize the aggressiveness of recurrent neuroblastoma.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","General Surgery"

The aim of this study was to assess the optimal preservation technique for intestinal grafts intended for transplantation by comparing the static cold preservation against continuous cold perfusion in a rat model.Materials and <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Comparison between static cold preservation (Control Group) with University of Wisconsin (UW) Preservation Solution versus Continuous Cold Perfusion with UW for perfusion (UW Perfusion Group) or a Modified Preservation Solution (MPS) containing UW with L-Arginine (MPS Perfusion Group) with rat intestinal grafts.30 cms. of Male Sprague-Dawley rats's small intestine were procured. The intestinal lumen was flushed with HEPES solution (pH 7.40) to remove intestinal debris. Two intestinal loops (10 cm each) were then connected to two custom perfusion chambers of an intestinal perfusion device. One chamber received a constant flow of UW solution and the other MPS solution and both submerged in a bath of deionized water at 4&deg;C. A third intestinal loop was placed in cold static preservation with UW solution. Intestinal tissue samples were taken at T0, T1 (1 hr), T3 (3 hrs.), and T6 (6 hrs.), fixed in Formalin at 10%, and sent to pathology for processing, analysis, and grading according to Park/Chiu Scoring System for Grading Intestinal Ischemia.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Both the UW and the MPS Perfusion groups better preserved the intestine in comparison to the static cold preservation after T6. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Continuous cold perfusion can better preserve intestinal grafts when compared to static cold preservation.

A safe and effective preservation solution is a precondition for successful small intestine transplantation. The most commonly used hypothermic preservation solutions for intestinal transplantation are the University of Wisconsin solution (UW) and histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK). We have previously shown that intestinal ischemia results in an increased fluid shift towards the lumen of the intestine. In the present study we demonstrate that as the temperature increases (4-37 C) the HTK becomes more acidic. Using this knowledge, our aim was to evaluate the effect of the UW and HTK solution on the viability of an intestinal preparation at normothermic temperature in a rat perfusion model.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Male Sprague Dawley rats (average weight 440g) were anesthetized and euthanized in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University. Two sequential small intestinal segments were procured and flushed with regular HEPES solution (with a pH 7.40, mOsm 300 at 37 C) to remove any remaining intestinal debris. The intestines were then connected to our intestinal chambers, which allowed both luminal and extraluminal perfusion. The first intestine was filled intraluminally with 1.5ml of UW Solution including 50&micro;M of FITC-Inulin, and was surrounded by standard UW solution on the vascular side. The second intestine was filled with 1.5ml of HTK Solution including 50&micro;M of FITC-Inulin, and was surrounded by HTK solution on the vascular side. Both chambers were maintained at 37<sup>o</sup> C. Sample measurements of intraluminal perfusate were made to measure FITC-Inulin concentration, using the Nanodrop 3300&trade;and  were taken at times 0,45,90 and 120 minutes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: When comparing the FITC-Inulin concentration in both intestines, there was a mean reduction of 43.25% of FITC-Inulin concentration in the UW arm vs a 9.5% decrease in the HTK arm, indicating more fluid secretion in the intestine exposed to UW.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have shown that UW solution increases the fluid shift towards the lumen at normothermic temperature compared to HTK solution. Surprisingly, we did not observe the expected amount of secretion from the acidic HTK. With that response, we recognized that UW is a better preservation solution at 37 C due to either it's buffering capacity in the intestinal lumen, or starch component present in it's composition. We hypothesize that UW results in decreased cellular swelling in the small intestine cells at normothermic conditions, and thus could leed to a a better outcome for intestinal preservation at normothermic temperatures.","Basic Science","Immunology/Transplantation","Transplantation"

Costantini<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of California - San Diego,Trauma, Surgical Critical Care, Burns And Acute Care Surgery,San Diego, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  In humans, the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a7nAChR) is encoded by the CHRNA7 gene and mediates an anti-inflammatory response to injury and infection. However, the human genome also encodes a uniquely human gene called CHRFAM7A that is an antagonist to a7nAChR-mediated signaling. Several studies have suggested that in humans, the ratio of CHRNA7 to CHRFAM7A modulates receptor activity. We have previously shown that: a) CHRFAM7A is highly expressed in human leukocytes; b) the ratio of CHRNA7 to CHRFAM7A gene expression in leukocytes varies widely amongst individuals; and c) CHRFAM7A is biologically active in the human THP1 pre-monocyte cell line. Here, we postulated that PMA differentiation of these monocyte precursors to monocytes might alter the CHRNA7 to CHRFAM7A ratio and alter monocyte gene expression. The effects of preventing a change in differentiation-induced CHRFAM7A gene expression was evaluated by its constitutive expression using gene delivery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  THP-1 cells were used in all experiments and monocyte differentiation was induced by incubation with PMA for 3 days in culture. Cell appearance and viability was assessed by light microscopy and flow cytometry respectively. CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7 gene expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Constitutive expression of CHRFAM7A was achieved with lentiviral transfection prior to PMA-induced differentiation. Gene expression in transfected CHRFAM7A and GFP-transduced differentiated monocytes were compared using RNA-seq with subsequent pathway analyses.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: CHRFAM7A expression was decreased by 70% in PMA-differentiated monocytes compared to untreated THP-1 cells. In contrast, there was no difference in CHRNA7 expression resulting in a net 5-fold increase in the expression of CHRNA7 compared to CHRFAM7A (see Figure). Over-expression of CHRFAM7A in differentiated monocytes produced viable cells with monocytic phenotype based on microscopic appearance and the presence of monocyte cell surface markers like CD14, CD22 and CD163. In contrast, the constitutive expression of CHRFAM7A in differentiated monocytes changed the expression of genes in pathways traditionally associated with regulating inflammatory response signaling and antigen presentation.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: The ratio of CHRNA7 to CHRFAM7A gene expression in THP1 cells changes after differentiation to monocytes. Preventing this change by gene transfection, CHRFAM7A has no effect on differentiation but alters the expression of genes that mediate the inflammatory response. Because CHRFAM7A is unique to the human genome, these data support the existence of a human-specific mechanism that regulates a7nAChR anti-inflammatory signaling and hence, the human immune response to injury and infection.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Trauma/Critical Care"

Responders were stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and monitored for proliferation via flow cytometry.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The human transcription factor CIITA functions as an up-regulator of SLA class II, producing cells with constitutive and stable class II expression. Both whole and CD4+ isolated PBMCs incubated with fibroblasts lacking expression of SLA class II demonstrated considerably less proliferation (0.39 and 0.15% respectively) compared to responders incubated with SLA class II positive cells (1.73 and 1.22%) given the near identical proliferation seen in whole PBMC versus isolated CD4+ population. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This novel swine adherent cell MLR assay facilitates the analysis of cross-species reactivity using human PBMCs, providing for a new assay for xenotransplant study.

HDAC2-/- mice tolerated 35 minutes of ischemia with comparable renal injury to that observed in WT mice after 28 minutes of IRI (p=0.48, Figure 1). Prolongation of the ischemic time by a further two additional minutes (37 min) resulted in non-survivable injury in HDAC2-/- mice.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Murine HDAC2 gene deletion leads to significant extension of renal IRI tolerance.

Specifically, subnormal monocyte function (seen in approximately a sixth of all such patients) has repeatedly been shown to be associated with infection-related complications. However, identifying the 'at risk' patient, as well as understanding the pathophysiology behind this disturbance, continues to elude the investigators. MicroRNAs hold the potential as stable biomarkers that fine tune host defenses. We aim to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) associated with the impaired monocyte response.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We produced 'impaired' human monocytes by exposure to LPS 10ng/mL (each containing 2.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> monocytes) and compared them to similarly incubated na&iuml;ve monocytes. Both preparations were then challenged with LPS 100ng/mL and the production of TNF&alpha;, IL-6 and IL-10 (ELISA) and HLA-DR expression (flow cytometry) were determined. MiRNA profiling was undertaken using microfluidic array technology (n = 4 for each determination).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Monocytes exposed to LPS 10ng/mL were found to have lower TNF&alpha;, IL-6 and IL-10 production in response to an LPS 100ng/mL challenge, when compared to the na&iuml;ve monocyte (p &lt; 0.05, paired T-test). Furthermore, these impaired cells had lower HLA-DR expression (p&lt;0.05). MiRNA profiling revealed that when compared to the na&iuml;ve monocyte, the LPS-impaired cells had upregulated miRNA- 487a &amp; miRNA-655, yet downregulated miRNA-433 &amp; miRNA-450a (p = &lt;0.05).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The precise processes behind immune dysfunction that appear following major trauma remain unclear. We have identified four dysregulated miRNAs associated with the impaired monocyte inflammatory response. Further study of these, and approximately 20 more differentially expressed miRNAs based on our preliminary data and literature consultation, may identify other markers, some of which may be associated with important signaling mechanisms present in the high risk patient.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

Previous work has shown that hydrophobically modified (hm) chitosan has great hemostatic potential.  This work aims to create a hm-chitosan coated gauze to directly compare to CG as well as ChitoGauze&reg; (ChG) in a lethal in vivo hemorrhage model.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Twelve Yorkshire swine were randomized to receive either hm-chitosan gauze (n = 4), ChG (n = 4), or CG (n = 4). A standard hemorrhage model was used in which animals underwent a splenectomy prior to a 6 mm punch arterial puncture of the femoral artery. Thirty seconds of free bleeding was allowed before dressings were applied and compressed for 3 minutes. Baseline mean arterial pressure was preserved via fluid resuscitation. Experiments were conducted for three hours after which any surviving animal was euthanized.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Hm-chitosan gauze was found to be at least equivalent to both CG and ChG in terms of overall survival(100% v 75%), number of dressing used(6 v 7), and duration of hemostasis (3 hrs v 2.25 hrs).  Total post-treatment blood loss was significantly lower in the hm-chitosan gauze treatment group (4.7 mL/kg) when compared to CG(13.4 mL/kg) and ChG(12.1 mL/kg) groups (p =&lt; 0.0001)<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Hm-chitosan gauze appears to have outperformed both CG and ChG in a lethal hemorrhage model.  However given the small treatment group size, the only measured outcome that was significantly different was total post-treatment blood loss.  Future comparison of hm-chitosan gauze to CG and ChG will be performed on a hypothermic and coagulapathic model that should allow for outcome significance to be differentiated under small treatment groups.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

The pathophysiology of ALI/ARDS is multifactorial, but can involve alarmins, activated immune cells, and inflammatory chemokines/cytokines.  DPR improves intestinal and hepatic blood flow to prevent gut-associated inflammatory changes and thus might also prevent or mitigate ALI/ARDS.  We hypothesized that soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), which is sloughed from endothelial cells in inflammatory conditions, might be elevated in resuscitated HS, and that DPR might prevent that event.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: ~~Male Sprague-Dawley rats (225-250g) were anesthetized and randomized to groups (n=8/group): 1) Sham (no HS, no conventional resuscitation or CR); 2) HS/CR; or 3) HS/CR+DPR.  HS was 40% of mean arterial pressure for 60 minutes.  CR was shed blood plus two equal volumes of lactated Ringers over 30 minutes total.  DPR was 25mL of pre-warmed 2.5% glucose peritoneal dialysis solution at the time of blood infusion.  Serum and lung tissue were collected at 4 hours post-CR.  Adhesion molecule levels were measured by ELISA: serum sICAM-1, lung integrin-alpha L (ITGAL or LFA-1), and lung integrin-alpha M (ITGAM or MAC-1). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:~~HS/CR increased sICAM-1 levels compared to Sham, and DPR increased sICAM-1 further compared to Sham or HS/CR (see Figure).   There were no differences in lung LFA-1 or MAC-1 levels in HS/CR or HS/CR+DPR compared to Sham. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:~~These data suggest that circulating levels of sICAM-1 are not mediated by gut blood flow and/or gut-associated inflammatory mediators in this model of resuscitated shock at this 4-hour post-CR time point.  Other post-resuscitation time points might reveal a benefit to DPR, which has been shown to improve the number of lungs suitable for organ transplant in human organ donors compared to donors who did not receive DPR treatment.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

HDM-2 over-expression in the cancer cell membrane may be a potential anti-cancer target. We tested this target using a p53-derived, HDM2-binding peptide for anti-cancer activity in MDR ovarian cancer. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Western blot analysis was used to demonstrate expression of HDM-2 in MDR SKOV-3 human ovarian cancer cell membranes compared to the membranes of untransformed fibroblasts. 5x10<sup>4</sup> cells were treated with HDM2-binding construct PNC--27 and control peptide. Anti-cancer activity and mechanism of PNC-27 were studied for cell viability (MTT), necrosis (LDH), apoptosis (Caspase-3) and co-localization of HDM-2 with PNC-27 (immunofluorescence).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  HDM-2 was strongly expressed in the cell membranes of MDR SKOV-3 by western blot analysis.  Accordingly, PNC--27 was selectively cytotoxic to these cells, inducing nearly 100% reduction in cell proliferation compared to control PNC--29 and untreated cells (p&lt;0.001; See Figure).  We observed a rapid (4h) cellular necrosis with a 2.5 fold increase in LDH (p&lt;0.001) and no caspase-3 activity.  This was shown to occur in a dose-dependent manner.  In contrast, PNC-27 had no effect on untransformed fibroblasts.  This observed effect was due to over-expression of HDM-2 in MDR SKOV-3 cells which demonstrated co-localization of PNC--27 and HDM--2 along their membranes.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  These findings demonstrate that HDM-2 over-expression in MDR ovarian cancer cells may be used as a potential target for anti-cancer therapy.

Improper catheterization can lead to unnecessary catheter associated urinary tract infections and urethral trauma, increasing patient morbidity. To prevent such complications, guidelines were created by the American College of Surgeons on how to insert and troubleshoot urinary catheters. As nurses have an increasing responsibility for catheter placement, resident responsibility has shifted to more complex scenarios. This study examines the clinical decision making skills of surgical residents during simulated urinary catheter scenarios. We hypothesize that while placing catheters, residents will make consistent choices for initial and subsequent catheters.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Forty-five general surgery residents (PGY 2-4) in Midwest training programs were presented with three of four urinary catheter scenarios. Scenarios varied in difficulty: A) female trauma patient with a bladder injury, B) female patient with labial constriction, C) male patient with complete obstruction of the urinary tract, and D) male patient with benign prostatic hypertrophy with partial blockage of the urinary tract. Residents were allowed 15 minutes to complete three scenarios. Scenario A was performed by all residents. Residents were presented with five different catheter choices and the option to consult an on-call Urologist. A Chi Squared test was performed to examine the relation between initial and subsequent catheter choices and to evaluate for consistency of decision making for each scenario.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: All (N=45) residents performed scenario A; 45% performed scenario B; 67% performed scenario C and 82% performed scenario D. For initial attempt for scenario A-C, the 16 French Foley catheter was the most common choice (38%, 54%, 50%, p&#39;s&lt;.001), whereas for scenario D, the 16 French Coude was the most common choice (37%, p&lt;.01). The variation in first choice of catheters is shown in Table 1. Residents were most likely to be successful in achieving urine output in the initial catheterization attempt (p&lt;.001). Chi-Square analyses showed no relationship between residents' first and subsequent catheter choices for each scenario (p's &gt;.05). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Evaluation of clinical decision making shows initial catheter choice may have been deliberate based on patient background, as evidenced by the most popular choice in scenario D.

Takabe<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Virginia Commonwealth University School Of Medicine And Massey Cancer Center,Division Of Surgical Oncology, Department Of Surgery,Richmond, VA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Traditionally, exposure to surgery to preclinical medical students has been remarkably limited which leads to an unfair, negative connotation towards the specialty. Restriction is not only limited in time, but also to learning in the operating room. Use of alive animals for training preclinical medical students has been a topic of debate, from animal protection and cost stand point. Use of an alive porcine model was reported to most closely prepare the medical students for the anxiety and perioperative demands required in the OR, with most students reporting that it was an imperative part of their education. On the other hand, porcine operations are widely expensive. Therefore, we hypothesize that even small animal (murine) models will be a vital component of training preclinical medical education. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Murine breast cancer E0771 cells were orthotopically implanted in female Blk/6 mice to generate breast tumor. A radical mastectomy, defined as the surgical removal of the tumor with surrounding skin and pectoralis major muscle, was performed on Female C57Blk6 mice of various ages. Wound parameters, time to complete procedure, number of sutures per minute, and weight of tissue removed, were recorded.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Improvement of surgical skills was observed in all parameters we recorded. Wound closure was successful in all widths attempted from 0.5cm to 1.5cm. The number of stitches per minute nearly doubled after only 6 wound closure experiences. The time required to complete the radical mastectomy procedure decreased by almost half by the 9<sup>th</sup> case. Finally, the appropriate stitch interval of 2-3mm was ascertained after the 5<sup>th</sup> wound closure. Notably a single animal died immediately after the operation, which was found due to inappropriate anesthesia management during the removal of a large tumor, which was contrary to the anticipation that death can occur by inexperienced surgical skills such as failure to control bleeding or unable to close the wound. However, it was the lack of understanding of the overall operative environment that actually resulted in the death of the animal. This highlights the importance of preclinical medical students being exposed to an environment that resembles the stress and responsibility that the OR demands, where a life is at stake, even if it is an animal's. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The animal model to train preclinical medical students provides an invaluable learning experience, not only to improve surgical skills, but also to realize the importance of overall operative care, such as anesthesia management, even in small animals. Learning surgical techniques in an environment that can simultaneously teach medical students 'what is essential to maintain life in the OR', will without question improve preclinical medical education, in addition to positively shifting the attitudes of medical students towards the field of surgery.","Education","Simulation Training (Technical and Non-technical)","Cross Disciplinary"

When these events are analyzed, poor communication and failure of the surgical team are the most common underlying cause. While the emphasis within the hospital has been on teamwork and communication, medical school education has not adapted these techniques. This has led to a number of students never working in multidisciplinary teams and student dissatisfaction.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We developed an interprofessional curriculum for medical students, PA students, and nursing students to help promote communication and teamwork in simulated surgical scenarios. Students are briefed prior to simulation and teams are formed. The team is allowed to spend some time interacting and developing rapport. Nursing students are introduced to the clinical scenario and allowed to assess prior to calling for the medical and PA students. The team is allowed to manage the clinical scenario for 15 minutes. The scenarios are recorded and monitored by faculty. After completion of the scenario debriefing and film review is done with faculty insight. Circular evaluation and team dynamics are also used to encourage student engagement. After completion of the curriculum, the students are surveyed on the effectiveness of the team dynamics as well as their perceptions of team training. Surgical scenarios are chosen from cases the students have been exposed to during their surgical rotation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Since implementation 51 students have participated. Of all participants 66% have shown growth and improvement on post-curriculum survey. 100% of participants believe the curriculum was educational and met their needs. 20% of students have requested to repeat the curriculum. Amongst nursing students the majority felt better equipped to work in a surgical setting and felt comfortable to speak up during sentinel events. Medical students showed the greatest decline in their abilities when faced with moral and ethical scenarios. The students felt undertrained to deal with these scenarios during their non-clinical years of medical school.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This data indicated that formalized communication training utilizing simulation scenarios enhances teamwork amongst students. Furthermore, early training of students allows for the fundamental aspects of communication and teamwork prior to entrance into clinical practice.By exposing students to interprofessional education, we have shown that student satisfaction and perceptions of learning have significantly improved. Finally, we have identified knowledge gaps within medical student education that can be addressed during their clinical years and prepare them for medical practice.","Education","Simulation Training (Technical and Non-technical)","Cross Disciplinary"

However, the impact of such training and the retention of skills and knowledge have not been studied in detail.  This work provides information on long-term follow up on the training, evaluation, and skill retention in medical students.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All the medical students received simulation based palliative care training in their third year of Surgery clerkship at our institution.  The training included three scenarios that reflected surgical patients and conditions commonly encountered during the surgical clerkship.  Moreover, the training was intended to expose students to: (i) learning about diversity and importance of religious beliefs, (ii) experience with advance directives, (iii) learning about palliative care management, (iv) giving bad news, (v) end-of-life preferences/DNR, (vi) talking about death and dying, (vii) talking about religious/spiritual values as they contribute to end-of-life care. All the students were surveyed after one year to ascertain if they used any skills/knowledge learned in this training in their other rotations, any knowledge they retained, and their overall perception of the training. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The survey was sent to all the graduating fourth year medical students (105) in our program out of which 69 students completed the survey (66% response rate), where 57% were male. All (100%) students agreed that the palliative care training is essential in medical school training.  Seventy percent of the students agreed that the training they received at our institution helped them develop the skills needed for palliative/end-of-life care communication with the most useful part of the training being &lsquo;giving bad news' (85%).  Moreover, when a question on knowledge or skill retention was asked after a year of training, the majority of students felt that they had retained the skills on giving bad news (80%), talking about death and dying (45%), and end-of-life preferences/advance directives/DNR (44%).  A small number of students (16%) claimed they retained their skills on talking about religious/spiritual values.  Several students mentioned that more of such training (probably in other rotations) would be beneficial and also indicated the value of seeing their residents or physicians leading these conversations during their clinical rotations.    <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Early training in palliative and end-of-life care communication is feasible during clerkships and students retain the skills and knowledge they gain from this experience.

However, the best method to implement and assess the results of a department-wide mentorship program in surgery is unclear. METHODS               We implemented a departmental faculty mentoring program in July 2014 that consisted of both structured and informal meetings between junior faculty mentees and assigned senior faculty mentor.  All senior faculty mentors attended a brief mentor training session.  We then developed an evidence-based mentorship instrument that featured standardized metrics of academic success.  This instrument was completed by each mentee and then reviewed at the junior faculty's annual career conference with their division chief.  A survey was distributed in July 2015 to assess junior faculty satisfaction with the new mentorship program. RESULTS               Junior/senior faculty consisted of 6/3 women and 16/11 men respectively.  Junior faculty were 38&plusmn;3 years of age and had been an attending for 4&plusmn;3 years.  Mentorship meetings occurred approximately 3 times during the year (range=0 to 10).  Total meeting time with senior mentors was a mean of 90 minutes (range=0 to 300 minutes).  Over 75% of junior faculty were very or somewhat satisfied with the mentorship program and would like to continue in the program.  The best aspect of the program was the opportunity to meet with an accomplished surgeon outside of their division.  Opportunities to improve the program included better matching of mentor to mentee by disease or research focus.  Interestingly, almost the entire junior faculty tended to have at least 2 other mentors besides the mentor assigned to them in this program. In terms of program outcomes, junior faculty agreed that the mentorship program improved their overall career plans and enhanced their involvement in professional organizations, but did not help with academic productivity, home/work balance, and overall job satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS               A mandatory, structured mentorship program with senior surgeons benefits most junior faculty in terms of academic advancement.  More research is required to understand the best method to pair mentors and mentees and more objective measurements of academic surgery success.","Education","Continuing Medical Education","Cross Disciplinary"

However, nearly 88% of members of the Association of Women Surgeons perceived gender based discrimination in residency. We observed a trend of junior female residents being assigned to more breast cases than their male counterparts. We hypothesized that a gender bias begins in the early years of surgical training with the assumption that females are more interested in a career in breast surgery. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We reviewed all partial mastectomies performed at our institution from July of 2010 through June of 2015 and recorded the PGY level and gender of the resident participating. A total of 850 cases were identified. Cases with no resident participating were excluded as well as cases with a male and a female resident scrubbed in together. The data was compared by PGY level as well as categorical vs. non-categorical status. Data was analyzed with SPSS to calculate significant differences using the Chi-square test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Female residents at our institution comprised 30% to 55% of the resident compliment depending on the academic year. When divided into PGY-level, female residents were responsible for a larger than expected proportion of the hookwire cases than their male counterparts for all but one year. The disproportionate representation reached statistical significance with a P of &lt;.05 in 6 categories (2011-2012 all residents, PGY1-3, and categorical PGY1-3; 2012-2013 Categorical PGY1-3; 2013-2014 Categorical PGY-1, and 2014-2015 categorical PGY-2)  When we looked at the attrition rate of the program there were 4 residents, all female, who left the program during the time period examined. Three left after the second year of residency and of the 3 residents who left after second year each had the highest percentage of hookwire cases of their class in the PGY-1 year.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There appears to be a trend in resident case assignment towards a higher proportion of female residents being assigned to breast cases compared to their male resident counterpart. This bias is likely multi-factorial but may have a significant influence on a female resident's career choice.  This bias may not only assume that a female resident only wants to perform breast surgery but also assumes conversely that they are not interested in a broad based surgical career.  Further multi-institutional studies are needed to better assess this trend.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

A chart audit was also performed post-intervention to determine physician compliance with the distributed best practice guidelines.       <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 567 physicians completed the survey in 2012 and  375 completed it in 2015. Post-intervention, statistically significant improvements were seen in the percentage of surgeons and anesthesiologists combined who reported changing their management of morbidly obese surgical patients to comply with best practices preoperatively (89% vs. 59%), intra-operatively  (71% vs. 54%), post-operatively (80% vs. 57%,), and overall (88% vs. 72%).  Results were similar when surgeons and anesthesiologists were analyzed separately. A chart audit of 170 cases from the four hospitals combined found that 167 (98%) cases were compliant with best practices.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: After distributing the morbid obesity perioperative care map, the percentage of surgeons and anesthesiologists who reported changing their management to match best practices significantly improved.  These findings highlight the beneficial impact this educational intervention can have on physician behavior.  Continued investigation is needed to evaluate the influence of this intervention on clinical outcomes.","Education","Continuing Medical Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Social media such as Twitter allows educators to cost-effectively distribute information across geographical borders while allowing learners to customize the information they receive. However, there has been a lack of research on assessing the use of social media to further surgical education. We sought to examine the use of Twitter for surgical education.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Individual tweets were identified using the hashtag 'surgicaleducation' for one entire month. Individual users who generated these tweets were identified to determine user characteristics such as location, gender and type of affiliation. The content of the tweets were qualitatively analyzed to determine whom the tweet was directed towards, the overall purpose, the associated surgical discipline, the contents of links, and if the tweets were associated with a scholarly conference. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In total, 84 English language tweets with the hashtag 'surgicaleducation' were collected with 52 unique users. Overall, 48 (57.14%) of the tweets were directed exclusively towards other clinicians and a majority of the tweets contained content that was an opinion about surgical education (26 [30.95%]) followed by promotion of scholarly activity (23 [27.38%]) and announcing an educational event or opportunity (13 [15.48%]). In total, 18 (21.43%) of the tweets were related to a surgical conference. There were 53 (63.10%) tweets that had an associated link and of these links a majority were to a peer-reviewed journal article (19 [35.85%]), followed by healthcare-related websites (15 [28.30%]), and multi-media (10 [18.87%]).  A majority of the users were located in the United States (32 [61.54%]) with the central (10 [31.25%]) and northeast (9 [28.13%]) regions of the United States having the most users. 28 (53.85%) of the users were private users, of whom 17 (60.71%) were identified as male. Overall, 29 (55.77%) were affiliated with university hospitals, 8 (15.38%) with non-profit organizations and 6 (11.54%), with peer-reviewed journals. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Social medial platforms, such as Twitter, are a powerful tool to share information in the field of surgical education. Of those who use Twitter for surgical education, most are from university programs in the United States and use the medium to share personal opinions, promote scholarly activity and inform others about educational events and opportunities. Future efforts should be directed at better understanding and utilizing this new paradigm in scholarly communication.","Education","Continuing Medical Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Mental skills are psychological strategies designed to enhance performance and reduce the impact of stress to consistently facilitate the ideal mental conditions that enable performers to perform their best. Mental skills have been used routinely in other high-stress domains (e.g., with Navy SEALs, military pilots, elite athletes, etc.) to facilitate optimal performance in challenging situations. We have developed a novel mental skills curriculum (MSC) to aid surgical trainees in optimizing their performance under stressful conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of this MSC in reducing novices' stress.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The MSC was implemented with a convenience sample of surgical novices over 8 weeks. Two stress tests were administered prior to and after completion of the MSC to assess its effectiveness in reducing trainee stress. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)  is a validated method of measuring participants' stress responses; it was implemented by giving participants ten minutes to prepare for an impromptu presentation, and five minutes to present it in front of a medical education expert who would be assessing them. The O'Connor Tweezer Dexterity Test (OTDT) is a test of fine motor dexterity; participants competed against each other in small groups who would complete the test the fastest. Such competition has been shown to cause acute stress in performers.To assess stress, heart-rate (HR), perceived stress (STAI-6), and perceived workload (NASA-TLX) were completed during all testing sessions.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Nine novices (age 23 &plusmn;7 years, 55% women) completed the MSC. While heart rate increased significantly during all tests, participants perceived less stress during the TSST and OTDT tests (p&lt;.05) after completion of the MSC.  In addition, they reported significantly less workload during the second OTDT administration (p&lt;.05) and showed a trend towards faster completion of this test (see table 1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The novel mental skills curriculum implemented in this study was effective at reducing surgical novices' perceived stress and workload based on two validated stress tests. Although not statistically significant, participants' enhanced performance during the OTDT is encouraging. This curriculum may be valuable to help surgical trainees and surgeons reduce intraoperative stress and increase patient safety in the operating room. Additional study utilizing a larger sample size is currently underway at our institution to validate the effectiveness of this curriculum.","Education","Simulation Training (Technical and Non-technical)","Cross Disciplinary"

Stain<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Albany Medical College,Department Of Surgery,Albany, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) tracks 30-day surgical outcomes. Improvement in clinical outcomes has been displayed by providing NSQIP data to surgeons. Recently, the ACS created the Quality In-Training Initiative (QITI). QITI is provides surgical residents with their own NSQIP outcomes data. We aim to show that current surgical residents have limited knowledge of their personal clinical outcomes. With current resident duty hour requirements and increasing shift towards outpatient management of diseases, we believe surgical residents' perception of their outcomes is anecdotal.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: IRB approval was obtained and an anonymous electronic survey was distributed to general surgery program coordinators for distribution to general surgery residents. Objective data collected includes training program, post-graduate year, major cases logged, and NSQIP and/or QITI participation. Subjective data includes resident perception of post-op length of stay (LOS), surgical site infection (SSI), readmission, and death. The remaining data collected relates to the resident's perceived benefit of receiving personal surgical outcome data, the frequency resident's follow patients post-operatively and until discharge. Statistical analysis of this data was performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:To date, 40 survey responses were received. Residents training in academic programs included 28/40 (70%). There are 24/40 (60%) PGY-3 or above residents. The average number of cases logged amongst respondents was 503. Most residents' programs participate in NSQIP, 37/40 (92.5%). However, only 4/40 (10%) of residents' programs participate in QITI. All programs that participate in QITI provide outcomes data to the residents, of which all residents report &lsquo;excellent' knowledge of their surgical outcomes (LOS, SSI, readmission, deaths). From the programs that do not participate in QITI, resident knowledge of surgical outcomes was &lsquo;fair,' 32/36 (89%) &lsquo;agree' or &lsquo;strongly agree' QITI outcomes data would improve their training, and 27/36 (77%) &lsquo;agree' or &lsquo;strongly agree' QITI outcomes data would improve their surgical outcomes. Lastly, 36/40 (90%) were &lsquo;likely' or &lsquo;highly likely' to follow their post-operative patients to discharge, but only 5/40 (12.5%) were &lsquo;likely' or &lsquo;highly likely' to see their post-operative patients in clinic.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:Resident perception of their personal postoperative outcomes (LOS, SSI, readmission, death) is limited without the use of QITI data. Further contributing to residents being unaware of postoperative outcomes may be the limited outpatient follow up. Residents believe receiving QITI data will improve their training experience and improve their postoperative outcomes, which we plan to study in a future trial.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

These protocols are designed to promote patient safety, service quality, and cost-effectiveness.  We evaluated analytical skills of surgical residents and fellows in relation to various 'pathways.' Our hypothesis was participants would 'default to a protocol', instead of critical thinking in critical care scenarios.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  After IRB approval, we developed a 14 question, multiple-choice survey for residents and fellows.  The questions were validated by experts, and focused on common scenarios encountered in the ICU.  The questions evaluated decisions to 'follow the protocol' for the given stem, either as a distractor or the correct answer.  Critical thinking was defined as answering the question correctly.  The questions were distributed to residents and fellows at three regional institutions.  Data was analyzed using frequency statistics and paired samples t-tests.  An alpha of .05 assumed significance.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 342 residents and fellows were emailed surveys.  When choosing the correct answer, 81.3% of the time, critical thinking was used.  When the incorrect answer was chosen, it was attributed to not thinking critically 66% of the time. Ultimately, participants chose to incorrectly follow the protocol 34.3% of the time.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study shows a trend for trainees to follow a protocol as a reflex, without critical assessment or decision making.  Our findings cast doubt on the use of protocols in training residents and fellows. As surgical educators, we cannot allow learners to defer critical thinking abilities in favor of easy established protocols.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

We hypothesized that skills modules in introduction to the laparoscopic tower, endoscopic tower, and laparoscopic abdominal access during surgery intern orientation would increase intern confidence and ability in these skills.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In this intern orientation-based pilot of three introductory curriculum modules, six categorical general surgery interns underwent attending-led modules on introduction to the laparoscopic tower, endoscopic tower, and laparoscopic abdominal access. Both confidence and ability to perform the skill were assessed pre and post module on a 1-5 Likert scale (1=unable to do, 3=able to do with verbal cues, 5=able to do independently). Paired t-tests were used to compare means.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of 6 interns, 1 had zero hours of simulation training in medical school, 3 had 1-5 hours, and 2 had 6-10 hours. History of simulation training did not correlate with pre-module confidence in any module (p&gt;0.05).The introduction to the laparoscopic tower module assessed the ability to identify components of the tower, completely set up the tower, assemble the scope, white balance the scope and turn on the insufflator, and troubleshoot an alarming insufflator. Intern confidence increased significantly from a pre-module mean of 2.83 to a post module mean of 4.77 (range 1-5 to 4-5, p&lt;0.01). Ability to perform the skills increased from a pre-module mean of 3.12 to post-module mean of 4.97 (range 1-5 to 3-5, p&lt;0.01).The introduction to the endoscopic tower module assessed the ability to identify an upper and lower endoscope, identify the function of the buttons and dials, assemble the tower, and troubleshoot the scope camera. Intern confidence significantly increased from a pre to post module mean of 2.56 to 4.06 (range 1-4 to 2-5, p&lt;0.01) and ability to perform the skills increased from a pre to post module mean of 3.90 to 5.00 (range 3-5 to 5, p&lt;0.001).The introduction to laparoscopic abdominal access assessed the ability to identify different approaches (Hassan, Veress, optical), explain complications and contraindications, and obtain abdominal access. Intern confidence significantly increased from a pre to post module mean of 1.90 to 3.90 (range 1-4 to 2-5, p&lt;0.01). Due to time constraints, pre-testing was not assessed for the abdominal access module. On post-test, the mean score was 2.88 (range 1-4).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our pilot study showed a statistically significant increase in both intern confidence and ability to perform skills on three introductory modules. By incorporating these modules into surgery intern orientation, we were able to introduce important basic skills to better prepare for residency.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

The Association of American Medical Colleges lists it among the eight procedures in which all graduating medical students should be competent. However, it was reported that 30% of third year, and 23% of fourth year medical students have never placed an IV. IV cannulation can be a source of anxiety for medical students as it is often their first procedural patient care. We sought to investigate what barriers medical students face in successfully honing this skill and what factors have a positive impact on the success rate of IV placement. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A confidential web-based survey consisting of 12 free response and multiple choice questions was created and distributed via email to total of 367 third and fourth year students at a single US allopathic medical school. The responses were collected over a 2-week period in July 2015. The data were then imported and analyzed by two-tailed, unpaired T-tests. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The response rate was 49.0% (180/367). The mean age of respondents was 25.4 years old, with males making up the predominant sex at 54.8%. 65.5% of the M3 class and 21.8% of the M4 class have never even attempted to place an IV due to lack of opportunity in the hospital environment but this is most likely because the survey was conducted at the beginning of the year. Common difficulties cited include: improper positioning of the needle and failure to identify the most appropriate insertion site. Also contrary to our expectation, prior preparation such as reading, watching videos or lectures did not increase the success rate. Interestingly, 91.6% of students who reported 1 attempt were successful in that first placement. With each successive attempt the mean rate of failure trended down from 50.0% at 2 attempts to 25.6% for over 9 attempts. The success rate was significantly better after 10 attempts than at attempts 2-9. Students who had training prior to medical school demonstrated a significantly higher success rate compared to students without. As we expected the success rate was significantly higher in EMTs (81.4%, p=0.038) but surprisingly it was also higher in lab researchers (86.6%, p=0.014). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A significant percentage of students were not given opportunities to attempt IV cannulation. We found that neither the type of preparation nor the preferred location of placement has any affect on success rate. The first attempt had a high rate of success likely due to an increased level of supervision and attention. Prior experience, not only as an EMT but also as a lab researcher, significantly increases the success rate. Therefore, it is important for medical educators to target those with no prior experience in the healthcare field and ensure adequate training so that this impediment to their success can be overcome.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Poor interprofessional communication has been associated with medical error and patient harm. We explored the enablers and barriers to interprofessional communication between surgical residents and ward nurses with a view towards improving residents' educational experiences and the quality of surgical patient care.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a qualitative, ethnographic study of interprofessional communication between general surgery residents and nurses in surgical wards of two Toronto academic hospitals, Centres A and B, totaling 126 hours of observations.  Additional data were derived from semi-structured interviews (n= 33) with residents and nurses. Data were collected and analyzed iteratively to the point of theoretical saturation. Data were compared between the two centres for analysis of context-specific variables influencing communication. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Constraints on communication between residents and nurses at the two centres derived from contested meanings of space and time. Residents experienced the contested spatial boundaries of the surgical ward when they perceived nurses to project a sense of territoriality. Residents were thus found to engage in ward avoidance behaviours and they perceived ward work to be devoid of collaborative interprofessional work or educational opportunity. Nurses expressed difficulty getting residents to respond and attend to pages from the ward, and to have a poor understanding of the nurses' role. Contestations over time spent in training and patient care were found in resident-nurse interactions, wherein residents perceived seasoned nurses to devalue their clinical knowledge on the ward.  Nurses viewed the limited time that residents' spent in clinical rotation on the ward as adversely affecting communication. Residents felt nurses' tacitly and explicitly diminished residents' extensive education and clinical expertise resulting from a perceived unfamiliarity with the ward itself.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:There are numerous challenges to enhancing communication between nurses and residents at academic health centres that are rooted in culture. Interventions to improve the culture of interprofessional care have proven effective in some settings. Our study underscores that improvement efforts must (a) identify and target the many social and cultural dimensions of healthcare team member relations; (b) recognize how power is deployed and experienced in ways that negatively impact interprofessional communication; and (c) enhance an understanding and appreciation of each others' professional attributes and be delivered within a framework that incorporates the temporal and spatial dimensions of interprofessional care.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

This Chief served in the role for one year, and was a member of several Department of Surgery and institutional committees. The Chief's duties included: developing interventions targeted to areas with opportunity for improvement within the department and the institution, as well as overseeing the QI/PS projects required of each surgical resident. The QI/PS Chief created an institution-wide, multidisciplinary Resident QI/PS Committee which reported to the Graduate Medical Education (GME) Committee as well as a formal residency didactic curriculum based on Quality in Training Initiative (QITI). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:At least six successful initiatives were implemented during the inaugural QI/PS Chief year. A required progress note phrase was implemented in the electronic medical record (EMR) to improve Surgical Care Improvement Program compliance. The EMR phrase was modified to improve communication surrounding discharge planning. A treatment team 'face-sheet' was deployed to help patients recognize the members of their care team. An early post-operative Colorectal Mobility Initiative was implemented. The Resident QI/PS Committee, comprised of appointed residents, program directors, institutional officials, and the Director of QI/PS, met six times over the year. The agenda included PS events involving residents, best practices across campus, and preparation for the annual campus GME Quality Symposium.  A formal didactic for QI/PS curriculum was created based on the ACS NSQIP QITI guidelines.  Additionally, we found a significant increase in resident participation in our institutional GME Quality Symposium; participation increased 3-fold after the creation of the formal role. <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:The benefits of a QI/PS Chief include: increased participation of surgical residents in developing solutions to improve patient care quality and PS, identification of new QI/PS issues by an active group of providers with established pathways to enact change, and dissemination of QI/PS issues to a surgical residency by a peer group member. During their tenure, QI/PS Chiefs experience personal growth, advanced QI/PS education, and active engagement and involvement in institutional-wide change.

With its widespread use, residency training programs have started to incorporate OSN profile screening as an additional tool for evaluating applicants, a technique widely used in the hiring process of other professional industries. However, the value of screening residency applicants on social media websites remains undefined and controversial. The aim of our study was to prospectively examine the online social media presence of residency applicants before and after the residency match, and to characterize applicants' perspectives on the use of OSN screening in the residency selection process.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Two independent investigators searched several prominent social media websites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, MySpace, and GooglePlus) to determine whether they could identify the OSN profiles of students applying to a single surgical residency program at the University of Toronto. The search was performed in three iterations: the first during the 2014/2015 Canadian residency matching process, the second after the residency match was finalized but prior to the start of residency training, and the third several months after the start of residency training. The degree to which profiles were publicly accessible was noted.  After the last search was complete, applicants were surveyed on their OSN use as well as their OSN behaviour during the application cycle.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The most frequently used OSN website is Facebook, with 17% (8 of 46) of applicants being identifiable during the match compared to 39% after the match was complete. Only 7% of applicants were found on Instagram; this increased by 13% after the match was complete. The presence on Twitter and LinkedIn remained unchanged (13% and 45%, respectively). Moreover, the profile content on LinkedIn was limited to what was available in a candidate's application. The majority of profiles were only identifiable when an applicant's photo was used (72%). Moreover, identifying profiles of candidates with more common names was largely unsuccessful. Although inter-rater reliability of identifying profiles was adequate (kappa = 0.843), the search process was time consuming (average 10 minutes per candidate). Applicant survey responses are being actively collected and analyzed.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This study suggests that residency applicants limit their public OSN presence during the application cycle, with a re-emergence of OSN use after residency spots have been secured. Moreover, the majority of OSN platforms are of low yield, and searches cannot be performed without photographic identification, which may pose ethical concerns. If OSN profiling is to become a standard part of the residency application process, searches must be limited to high-yield platforms, and guidance must be sought from other industries to maximize the efficiency of OSN profiling and to ensure an ethical practice.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Over the past two decades, many medical schools have started offering a surgical 'boot camp,' or surgical capstone course, in the fourth year of medical school in an effort to improve students' performances when they begin surgical internship. The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive review of the literature to date evaluating the effects of a surgical boot camp.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Multiple searches of Pubmed were conducted to identify published papers to August 2015. Key search terms included surgical boot camps, capstone courses, and medical education reform. Abstracts and presentations at meetings were not included. Relevant articles were categorized by their method of evaluating boot camp outcomes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 14 studies evaluated the outcomes of surgical boot camps. Of these studies, 10 evaluated the impact of boot camps by rating student/intern confidence, while 8 assessed student/intern competence (2 studies evaluated both confidence and competence). The 10 studies that assessed confidence were unanimous in their finding that boot camps increase student and intern confidence. The 8 studies that assessed competence were unanimous in their finding that boot camps increase performance (on exams, procedures, or clinical tasks). However, only 3 of these 8 studies followed-up on performance into the intern year. These 3 studies assessed the competence of interns either by subjective methods (e.g. Likert scale ratings) or objective methods (e.g. OSCE scores), and the assessments occurred either in the simulated setting or the clinical (i.e. hospital) setting, as far as 6 months into internship. One study used objective and subjective methods to evaluate 29 interns in a simulated setting; another study used objective methods in a simulated setting and subjective methods in a hospital setting (n = 84 interns); the third study used objective methods in a simulated setting (n = 19 interns). None of these 3 studies evaluated intern competence using objective methods in the hospital setting. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite the demonstrated success of boot camps in improving the confidence of students and interns, the effect of a surgical boot camp on the actual clinical or operative performance of interns in a non-simulated hospital setting has not been studied.

A multifaceted Balance in Life program designed to improve residents' physical, psychological, professional, and social wellbeing was implemented at an academic residency program. This study evaluated the value of the individual program components amongst the residents.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  General Surgery residents (n=64) completed a voluntary electronic survey in 2014 and 2015 regarding utilization and perceived value of key components of the Balance in Life program during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 academic years. Program components included group psychological counseling sessions, a refrigerator stocked with healthy food, a Resident Peer Mentorship Program, a Class Representative System, social events, a ropes course, and a 1-day offsite resident retreat. Means and standard deviations were calculated for Likert responses overall, as well as by gender and PGY-level; t-tests were performed to assess for differences between subgroups.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Residents perceived all components of the program as valuable. The most valued components were the resident retreat (mean=1.27, 1=extremely valuable, 2=moderately valuable, 3=somewhat valuable, 4=slightly valuable, 5=not at all valuable) and the refrigerator (1.43), followed by social events (2.25), group psychological counseling sessions (2.33), the ropes course (2.38), the Resident Peer Mentorship Program (3.02), and the Class Representative System (3.11). Group psychological counseling sessions were valued highest by preliminary general surgery residents compared to categorical residents (1.96 vs. 2.59, p=0.03) and junior residents compared to senior residents (2.00 vs. 2.58, p=0.047). Gender differences between perceived value of the components were identified. Females valued the group psychological counseling sessions (p=0.02), refrigerator (p=0.03), social events (p=0.03), and Class Representative System (p=0.003) more than male residents. There were no statistical differences in perceived value of the components between the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 years.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A novel multifaceted Balance in Life program to address the physical, professional, and psychosocial wellbeing of surgical trainees is feasible and highly valued by residents. Gender and PGY-level differences exist in the perceived value of components, with females, junior residents, and preliminary residents placing higher value on specific components of the program. Further research is needed to quantify the effectiveness and longitudinal impact such a program has on resident depression, burnout, and other psychological factors.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Transitioning residents from observers to assistants to safe independent practitioners, while keeping patient safety paramount, is a complex feat. Faculty must make entrustment decisions and determine the degree to which they can safely release gradual responsibility to residents. It is imperative to better understand faculty-resident interactions in the operating room and means by which to identify entrustment that would allow for progressive autonomy. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Field notes were documented from 30 general surgery cases resulting in 160 hours of operating room observations with variations in pairing among 20 general surgery residents and 10 faculty. All observations were conducted at a single institution. Thematic analysis of field notes in combination with preliminary data from 32 resident interviews informed development of the Faculty-Resident Operative Entrustment Tool &ndash; OpTrust. OpTrust focuses on assessment of faculty-resident interactions which enhance or inhibit intraoperative entrustment decisions.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Through a highly iterative process of systematically reviewing OpTrust, the tool was refined to 6 items and 4 levels of descriptive anchors with each item describing behaviors on both sides of the faculty resident dyad. The 6 items are: (?) types of questions asked; (?) operative plan; (?) instruction; (?) problem solving; (?) leadership by the surgical resident; (?) near miss or error. Collectively, these items and leveled anchors provide a robust and multi-dimensional view of faculty-resident operative entrustment interactions, and the impact of behavior of each in achieving autonomy (Figure 1). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Identifying intraoperative behaviors and the level of entrustment associated with each behavior for both faculty and residents, OpTrust provides a novel pedagogical intervention to enhance resident progress towards greater autonomy.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Unregulated SMC migration leads to neointimal hyperplasia and eventually restenosis. We sought to develop an in vitro co-culture model to study SMC physiology under conditions of injury. We hypothesized that disrupting quiescent co-cultures would lead to stimulation of SMC chemotaxis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  SMC/EC co-cultures were established by growing human aortic EC to confluence onto the bottom surface of 0.45&micro;m porous polycarbonate membranes in 6-well Transwell<sup>&reg;</sup> inserts. Human aortic SMC were then grown to confluence on the top/inner side of the membranes and the co-cultures were then incubated for 48-72 hours to reach equilibrium. The porous membrane allows both chemical and physical communication between the cells, but maintains the layered architecture found in the vessel wall in vivo. To confirm this, the model was characterized using multiphoton fluorescent microscopy. Migrating SMCs were grown to confluence, serum starved for 48 to 72 hours, and seeded onto a second 24-well Transwell<sup>&reg;</sup> insert with 8.0 &micro;m pores. These inserts were then suspended into SMC and EC monocultures, as well as our co-culture model, both uninjured and injured. Injury of co-culture was created using a cell scraper. Migration was measured using a 4 hour modified Boyden chemotaxis assay. Comparisons were performed using a Student's T-test. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Using a Z-stacked technique, 3-Dimensional renderings and transverse sections of co-culture membranes demonstrated not only the establishment of healthy co-culture, but also the presence of cell-cell contact through the pores. Under serum-free stimulant-free conditions, SMC demonstrated a low baseline level of migration. SMC exposed to either EC or SMC monoculture alone demonstrated significantly increased migration (P&lt; .0001). SMC exposed to uninjured SMC/EC co-culture demonstrated migration that returned to unstimulated control levels (* P&lt; .0001). SMC exposed to injured SMC/EC co-culture exhibited significantly increased migration levels compared to uninjured conditions (** P&lt; .0001). Migrations results are summarized in Figure 1.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Confocal microscopy demonstrated the viability and utility of our co-culture model in studying vascular injury physiology in vitro. SMC and EC grown in co-culture induce a quiescence compared to either cell type alone, and as such had no influence on SMC chemotaxis. In contrast, disrupting this quiescence, by injuring the co-culture lead to a significant stimulation of SMC migration. This model holds promise to more accurately study the mechanism of restenosis.","Basic Science","Endothelial/Vascular Physiology","Vascular"

We have previously demonstrated testosterone (TST) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation in a dose dependent manner in vitro. Furthermore, we have shown that AD increases intimal hyperplasia (IH) in vivo in a rodent model of vascular injury, while physiological TST replacement attenuated this effect. Urotensin II (UTS) is a potent vasoconstrictor and can stimulate cellular proliferation. Activation of the UTS/UTS receptor mechanism has been shown to exacerbate vascular pathologies. Here we investigated the role of UTS in AD-induced IH.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Three groups of aged orchiectomized (AO) male rats underwent TST supplementation via controlled release pellet (0.5-5 mg). Young and aged intact (YI, AI) and AO placebo (Plac) groups served as controls. All groups underwent balloon angioplasty of the left common carotid following 14d TST therapy. Carotid tissue was collected 14d post-injury, and stained for UTS quantification. Human male VSMCs were treated with TST or DHT (0-3000nM) for 24h then subjected to qPCR for UTS/UTS receptor expression or PCNA/Ki67 proliferation marker analyses. Cells were stained with Phalloidin-FITC for visualization of cytoskeletal organization.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:UTS receptor staining was low in injured vessels of YI, AI, and Plac controls but was significantly upregulated in all AO groups receiving TST supplementation, irrespective of dose (Fig1A/B). UTS peptide in the tissue was not affected by TST exposure. In vitro exposure to DHT increased the expression of UTS receptor in VSMCs in a dose-dependent manner, with 3000nM increasing expression by 55&plusmn;13% vs. 0nM; n=3; P&lt;0.05. However, this did not correlate with any change in proliferative markers PCNA or Ki67. Phalloidin staining of filamentous-actin revealed that DHT induced cytoskeletal organization in a dose&ndash;dependent manner (Fig1C).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:AD alone does not affect the UTS/UTS receptor mechanism. However TST and DHT increase the expression of UTS receptor, in vivo and in vitro, respectively. This regulation has no effect on proliferative markers but does correlate to a shift in filamentous-actin organization. Analyses of this organization in the presence of UTS receptor agonist/antagonists, and its downstream effect on vasotone, are ongoing. Future studies will examine the potential for exogenous TST therapy to exacerbate dysfunctional vasoconstriction via the upregulation of UTS receptor. These studies are needed in determining if TST replacement in AD men should be evaluated for attenuation of vascular pathogenesis.","Basic Science","Endothelial/Vascular Physiology","Vascular"

Autophagy is an important cellular process for homeostasis during tissue repair. The role of autophagy in the wound healing process has not been investigated. This study evaluated the effect of the autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine, on cutaneous wound healing in mice.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Two groups of mice were subjected to excisional full-thickness splinted wounds created on the upper dorsum using a 5mm biopsy punch. The first group of mice were treated daily with an intraperitoneal injection of 50mg/kg chloroquine (CQ, n=8) starting 24hrs before wounding. The second group received saline as an untreated control (CON, n=10). Wound closure was assessed using serial photography and image analysis at days 0, 3, 7, 11 and 14, and expressed as a percentage of the original wound size. On day 14, the mice were euthanized and the wounds were harvested and analyzed by western blotting for markers of autophagy, the ratio of the lipidated autophagosome localized isoform of the microtubule-associated protein Light Chain-3 (LC3-II) to its non-lipidated cytosolic localized isoform (LC3-I) and the expression of Sequestosome-1 (p62).

However, the effect of combined mechanical and chemical stimulation of endothelial cells (EC) is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of steady laminar flow (CLF), as a mechanical stimuli, and Th, as a chemical stimuli, on yes-associated protein (YAP) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) activities in EC. YAP is a mechano-signaling protein that controls growth and proliferation depending on cell shape. ERK5 is an intracellular protein that maintains EC integrity.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Bovine aortic ECs seeded on fibronectin coated glass slides were grown to confluence in culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Thereafter, they were serum starved for 16 hours and were subjected to 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 hours of CLF utilizing a parallel plate flow chamber system controlled by a computerized pump for 4 hours at 37? in the presence or absence of Th (4U/ml). Western blot analysis of total and phospho-YAP and ERK5 was performed. The activities of YAP and ERK5 were determined based on the ratio of immunoblot intensity of phosphorylated to total protein. Fold change compared to static control (Ctrl) at 0 hour was calculated and compared for significant difference using t-test. P value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: ERK5 activity rose slightly through 4 h for all experimental groups but was only significantly increased in the Th group at 4 hours (1.95&plusmn;0.39; p&lt;0.03 vs Ctrl) (Figure B).

YAP phosph/total ratio was significantly increased with time through 4 h in the CLF group (p&lt;0.05 vs Ctrl), while the ratio in the CLF+Th group showed the similar time course pattern as in the Th group within 2 hours. However, at 4 h it rose to the level of the CLF groups (Figure A).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Thrombin and flow did not activate ERK5. YAP was phosphorylated in EC exposed to both thrombin and flow although flow stimulation was stronger. The combination of flow and thrombin had an additive effect on YAP phosphorylation.

The authors have previously demonstrated that local adipose tissue can exhibit an exacerbated inflammatory response to local surgical trauma. To date, however, links between human adipose phenotype and procedural outcomes such as wound complications have not been reported. We hypothesized that specific adipose-related biomarkers uniquely link to 30-day wound complication rates in patients undergoing open vascular surgical procedures. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Clinical history, peripheral blood, and subcutaneous and perivascular adipose tissue were prospectively collected from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA), lower extremity revascularization (LER), and lower extremity amputations (AMP) at the time of surgery. Nine adipose-associated biologic mediators (adiponectin, IL-1&beta;, IL-6, IL-8, leptin, MCP-1, PAI-1, resistin, and TNF) were assayed in the adipose tissues and plasma. Wound complications were classified according to a previously published grading system.

All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software,v9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC.) <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The cohort included 115 patients (49 CEA, 44 LER, 22 AMP).

At 30 days, 22 (19.1%) patients had wound complications&mdash;namely, superficial surgical site infections (14/22), hematoma (4/22), dehiscence (4/22), seroma or lymph leak (3/22), and deep surgical site infection (1/22). There were several statistically significant, plasma/perivascular/subcutaneous compartment-specific relationships between logarithmically transformed mediator levels and wound complications. Most notably, mean plasma TNF levels were higher in patients with superficial surgical site infections (figure, panel A), whereas plasma (figure, panel A), and perivascular (figure, panel B) TNF levels were lower in patients with wound dehiscence. There was also a trend relating elevated subcutaneous TNF levels and any wound complication (p=0.05.) <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Adipose-associated mediator levels at the time of operation demonstrate a compartment-specific relationship to wound outcomes in patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures.

We hypothesize that increased WSS and turbulence associated with AVFs act as a driving force for the altered biology in HD patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Utilizing vessel dimension and blood flow data compiled from the literature, normal systemic circulation was modeled and then adapted for left brachiocephalic AVF creation using postoperative values.  For each vascular segment, transit time, peak WSS, and peak Reynolds number (as an indicator of turbulent flow) were calculated.  Fraction of circulation time spent at high WSS (&gt;40 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) and turbulent flow (Reynolds number &gt;4000) was computed in normal and AVF models.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Increased flow after AVF creation results in elevated peak WSS and Reynolds number in the subclavian and brachial arteries.  Peak WSS in the left subclavian artery increases by more than seven fold from 32 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> preoperatively to 232 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> after AVF creation.  Left brachial artery peak WSS increases from 46.0 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> to 209.5 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> after AVF placement.  Overall, high peak WSS in normal upper extremity circulation occurs for 9.5% of circulation time but does not exceed 50 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> (Fig 1A).  After AVF creation, 13.5% of circulation time is spent at high WSS, with 7.4% of circulation time spent at over 200 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>.  With an AVF, subclavian artery flow turns turbulent as Reynolds number increases from 1309 in normal circulation to 9366.  Peak Reynolds number in the brachial artery increases from 660 to 3008 after AVF, reflecting more disordered and chaotic flow.  In normal circulation, 2.5% circulation time is spent at turbulent flow, while an AVF increases circulation time at turbulent flow to 13.9% (Fig 1B).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: AVF creation leads to elevated WSS and more turbulent flow compared to normal circulation.

Current murine mechanical injury models, which denude the endothelium in a retrograde fashion and require suture ligation of some portion of the arterial tree, have been criticized for the small proliferative response and high inter-animal variability. Our aim was to develop a simple, reproducible, mechanical, antegrade murine common carotid artery (CCA) neointimal hyperplasia model that does not require suture ligation of any portion of the cervical arterial tree. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  After creating an arteriotomy in the CCA with a 30G needle, a 0.010-inch hydrophilic wire was used to cannulate the CCA via the arteriotomy and denude the endothelium in an antegrade fashion. Hemostasis at the arteriotomy site was achieved by placing a topical cellulose matrix (Surgicel, Ethicon, Inc. Somerville, New Jersey) over the arteriotomy site. Mice were euthanized 0, 4, 11, and 32 days following CCA injury after systemic formaldehyde perfusion fixation.

Mean age was 72.9 &plusmn; 0.4 years. Renal volume &lt; 281 mL was correlated with CKD (AUC = 0.708, p = &lt;0.0001). RKVP &lt; 22.5 HU*L was correlated with CKD (AUC = 0.764, p = &lt;0.0001). High (&ge;15) ASG scores correlated with both renal volume (AUC = 0.628, p = &lt; 0.0001) and RKVP (AUC = 0.628, p = &lt; 0.0001). Regression analysis demonstrated a strong, inverse relationship between ASG and RKVP (Figure).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:These data demonstrate that the novel metric of RKVP correlates with both CKD and ASG in a large database of patients undergoing elective aneurysm repair. The inverse relationship between renal function (renal volume, RKVP or GFR) and ASG has not been described in the literature before. Outcomes in patients with poor renal function may be related to anatomical issues in addition to well-described systemic ramifications.","Basic Science","Endothelial/Vascular Physiology","Vascular"

Much of preclinical research utilizes male animal models to develop treatment modalities for clinical applications assumed to extrapolate to both genders.  In this study we evaluated normal and diabetic female rats response to stroke and reperfusion injury and compared to our previously characterized outcomes in male rats. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We utilized middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion model in normal and diabetic Wistar female animals.  Following 24-hour MCAO and 2-hour MCAO followed by 24-hour reperfusion interval, several CNS parameters were examined, lesion volume (Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride), up regulation of apoptosis [TUNEL immunoreactivity in the sensori-motor cortex (layers-5 and 6) and the hippocampal pyramidal cell layers  (CA1 and CA3 sectors)], as well as the percent survival.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The two parameters in which the female animals differed significantly from their male counter parts were i) in lesion volume following restoration of blood flow with 2-hour MCAO and ii) in mortality following 24-hour MCAO and in following restoration of blood flow with 2-hour MCAO. Restoration of blood flow following 2-hour MCAO significantly decreased lesion volume in the normal and diabetic female animals (13.95 &plusmn; 8.16* and 20.32 &plusmn; 6.85*, respectively).  In comparison to the male counterparts, lesion volumes following reperfusion were significantly less for normal male rats and significantly more for the diabetic male animals (3.8 &plusmn; 2.36# and 31.25 &plusmn; 2.5#, respectively). Twenty-hour MCAO and restoration of blood flow with 2-hour MCAO proved to be significantly more detrimental to the female animals with lower survival (normal 65%, diabetic 55% survival, p&lt;0.05) in comparison to the male animals (normal 90%, diabetic 65% survival, p&lt;0.05).  There was a significant increase in TUNEL immunoreactive cells in the diabetic animals following reperfusion injury compared with the control counterpart. There were no appreciable differences in TUNEL immunoreactivity between male and female diabetic animals following reperfusion. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This paper highlights the dramatically different outcomes and metrics in different genders in animal models. Thus one gender alone may not translate into clinically relevant data applicable to both genders.  We have demonstrated that both male and female diabetic animals have an exaggerated response to stroke and to restoration of blood flow but differ in their outcome with a significantly more detrimental outcome for the female sex.  Understanding the exaggerated vascular response to injury in the female animal model is important in developing gender specific treatment modalities.","Basic Science","Endothelial/Vascular Physiology","Vascular"

Polyphosphates are ubiquitous inorganic compounds that have recently been  linked to coagulation.  Polyphosphates are stored in platelets, and platelets are known to inhibit fibrinolysis.  We hypothesize that polyphosphate polymers that are similar in size to the length of chains stored in platelets will inhibit tPA mediated fibrinolysis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Polyphosphates of four different polymer lengths were evaluated.  Monophosphate, platelet length polyphosphates, medium size polyphosphates found in tissue, and large polyphosphates of the size produced by microbes.  Polymers of different sizes were added at a concentration of 20 micromolar in whole blood from eight healthy volunteers and assessed with thrombelastography (TEG) for changes in clotting parameters with and without tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to quantify inhibition in fibrinolytic activity.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Large polyphosphates reduced R time and increased angle in the presence of tPA compared control blood (p&lt;0.001, p=0.008) and trended towards an increase in clot strength (MA p=0.052).  Large, medium, and mono polyphosphates reduced LY30 compared to control (p=0.034, Figure 1).  The other polymer lengths in the presence of tPA did not significantly alter other clotting parameters.  Without tPA, the same relationship of shortened clotting time and increased angle were appreciated with the large polyphosphates (p&lt;0.001, p=0.015).  None of the other polymer lengths affected clot parameters. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Large chain polyphosphates are associated with a rapid forming strong clot.  Polyphosphates polymers in the length stored in platelets, however, did not impact clotting parameters.  But all other polymer lengths inhibited tPA mediated fibrinolysis.

Endothelial cell regeneration is critical to preventing thrombotic and myointimal complications after vascular injuries and interventions, but the impact of hyperglycemia on this process is not well understood. Since hyperglycemia directly inhibits cellular homeostasis, we propose that it negatively impacts endothelial cell regeneration.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Proliferation Protocol: Human aortic endothelial cells(HAEC) were grown in standard culture conditions, and then plated in a 96-well plate at 5000 cells per well. After reaching ~70% confluence, the cells were quiesced with serum starvation for 24 hours. The cells were restimulated with growth media (positive control) or quiescent media (negative control) with 40mM glucose or 40mM mannose (oncotic control) added to both groups. After 72 hours, HAEC proliferation was collected by commercially available cell viability assay using absorbance.3D Angiogenesis Assay: HAECs were formed into pellets (40,000 cells) using mechanical rotation.  The pellets were suspended in a fibrin hydrogel. The cell pellets were exposed to either 40mM glucose in growth media, 40mM mannose in growth media, or growth media for 3 days. HAEC invasion was captured by daily microscopy and analyzed as average sprout length at 10-degree intervals through 360 degrees by Matlab programming. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Contrary to our hypothesis, HAECs had greater proliferation in a 72-hour high glucose and high mannose environment compared to normal growth media (p&lt;0.0001, p=0.030). Glucose media had additional proliferation potential compared to mannose media (p=0.012). High glucose and mannose conditions did not inhibit HAEC sprout length at any time point in the 3D angiogenesis assay. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:While there is literature supporting an inhibitory effect of high glucose on endothelial cells, it is related to a combination of concentration and time of exposure to high glucose conditions. In this work, we are surprised to find not only a lack of inhibition of EC sprout formation, but also an increase in EC proliferation with both high glucose and high mannose conditions. Perhaps, the 24 hours of quiescence positively affects proliferation in functionally starving cells. We are actively testing this by including the high glucose levels from the beginning of the experiment. The lack of inhibition on EC sprouting suggests that acute hyperglycemia may not inhibit EC angiogenic activity in a meaningful manner. The duration and severity of hyperglycemia that must be avoided remains a clinically important idea that must be further pursued.","Basic Science","Endothelial/Vascular Physiology","Vascular"

Mean difference estimates and chi-square tests were used as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to evaluate the predictors of post-operative outcomes (any stroke or death and myocardial infarction (MI)) adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, symptomatology, degree of stenosis and emergency surgical status. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 10,169 patients who underwent carotid revascularization, 9,817 (96.5%) underwent CEA while 352 (3.5%) underwent CAS during the study period. Sixty one percent of the cohort were males. Patients who underwent CEA were older than those undergoing CAS [mean age (SD): 71.3 (9.4) vs. 69.1 (9.7) years, p &lt;0.001]. However, patients who underwent CAS had a greater prevalence of diabetes (38.4% vs. 29.2%, p&lt;0.001), hypertension (88.1% vs. 84.9%, p=0.104), congestive heart failure (4.8% vs. 1.4%, p&lt;0.001) and COPD (17.3% vs. 10.2%, p&lt;0.001). The risk of post-operative stroke/death was 92% higher with CAS (Adjusted odds ratio: 1.92; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.04-3.52), receiving blood transfusion 72 hours prior to surgery was associated with 5-fold increase of mortality odds (aOR: 5.47; 95%CI: 1.79-16.73), other significant predictors of stroke/death were symptomatic status (aOR: 1.60 ,95%CI:1.19-2.16) and emergency surgery status (aOR: 2.35 ,95%CI: 1.31-4.23).  No significant association was found between the type of procedure and odds of unplanned reoperation (aOR: 0.60; 95%CI: 0.22-1.63). Thirty-day post-op myocardial infarction was mostly related to patient's age and being on hypertension medication whereas the type of procedure was found not to be significantly associated with post-op MI (aOR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.26-2.67). Although readmission odds was higher for CAS, this association was not significant (aOR: 1.23; 95%CI: 0.82-1.85)<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Carotid stenting is associated with higher odds of both post-operative mortality and stroke. The adverse impact of pre-procedural blood transfusion on outcomes is a call for caution and deserves further elucidation. Carotid procedure type is not a predictor of post-op MI or readmission, suggesting that these outcomes are a function of other patient factors.

Despite this relatively high incidence, patients inconsistently receive chemoprophylaxis. The true incidence of VTE among patients receiving chemoprophylaxis is unknown. We sought to explore the effect of not only administration, but timing of administration of chemoprophylaxis on risk of VTE and post-operative bleeding among patients undergoing major open vascular surgery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients undergoing major open vascular surgery (defined as open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, aorto-femoral bypass, mesenteric bypass) and infrainguinal bypass were identified from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) between 2008 and 2012. Rates of VTE (deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) were compared between patients receiving and not receiving routine VTE chemoprophylaxis using univariate and multivariate statistics. Delay in the initiation of chemoprophylaxis was defined as initiation of therapy greater than 1 day following surgery.  Among patients receiving VTE chemoprophylaxis, the effect of the timing of initiation of chemoprophylaxis upon development of VTE was determined using multivariate statistics. Post-operative complications were compared among all groups using univariate and multivariate analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of  8776 patients underwent major open vascular surgery, including 1068 open AAA repairs, 958 aorto-femoral bypass and 6483 infrainguinal bypass procedures. The overall incidence of 30-day VTE was 1.4%, ranging from 0.99% among patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass and 2.62% among patients undergoing open abdominal procedures. Among all patients who received VTE chemoprophylaxis anytime during their admission, the rate of VTE was 1.45% as compared to 1.38% among those who did not receive chemoprophylaxis. However, accounting for the timing of chemoprophylaxis initiation, delay in the administration of VTE chemoprophylaxis was associated with a significantly higher risk of VTE (OR 3.92, p&lt;0.01), controlling for pre-op risk of VTE. There was no increased risk of post-operative transfusion among patients receiving routine chemoprophylaxis compared those who did not (16.28% vs. 17.43%, p=0.197).<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:Although patients undergoing major open vascular surgery appear to have a low risk of VTE at baseline, there is a significantly higher risk of developing VTE among patients who have a delay in the administration of VTE chemoprophylaxis. Bleeding complications were no higher among patients who routinely receive chemoprophylaxis.  Surgeons should consider routinely initiating chemoprophylaxis in the early post-operative setting following major open vascular surgery.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Although various studies report factors associated with readmission or mortality in this population, data continue to be limited regarding the temporal risk profile for readmissions and mortality during the initial postoperative year. We set out to determine the relationship between various clinical determinants, hospital readmissions, and mortality in a sample of vascular surgical patients. We hypothesized that factors independently associated with hospital readmission and mortality will gravitate from traditional &quot;short-term&quot; indicators toward the more established &quot;long-term&quot; outcome determinants at 90, 180, and 360-day postoperative cut-off points.   <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Medical records of peripheral vascular surgery patients at two institutions (2008-2014) were retrospectively reviewed. Abstracted data included demographics, procedural characteristics, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status, Goldman Criteria for postoperative cardiac complications, Charlson Comorbidity Index, morbidity, readmission data (30-day, 180-day, 360-day), and mortality (30-day, 180-day, 360-day). Univariate analyses were performed for both readmissions and mortality at each specified time point. Variables reaching statistical significance of p&lt;0.20 were included in subsequent multivariate analyses for factors independently associated with readmission/mortality.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 450 patients were included in the current analysis. Most patients underwent either a bypass or endarterectomy revascularization (406/450) or non-catheter dialysis access procedure (44/450). There were 188 males and 262 females (mean age 61.1&plusmn;13.8, 14% emergent procedures, median operative time 177 minutes). Median hospital length of stay (index admission) was 4 days (25%-75% IQR 2-8 days). Cumulative readmission rates at 30, 180, and 360 days were 12%, 27%, and 35%. For mortality, the corresponding figures were 3%, 7%, and 9%, respectively. Table 1 shows factors independently associated with 30-day, 180-day, and 360-day readmissions and mortality.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We noted important patterns in temporal variability regarding the risk of hospital readmission and mortality in peripheral vascular surgery patients. Previous readmissions, frailty/acuity indices, and cardiovascular morbidity were all independently associated with subsequent risk of readmission and mortality. The knowledge of temporal trends described herein may be helpful in guiding readmission reduction approaches -- a consideration of increasing importance in the evolving paradigm of value-based healthcare.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Patients with an abnormal 30 day post operative CT scan were excluded.  Time points chosen for analysis were 1-year, 2-year, 3-years and 10-year post EVAR.  A combined model including three outcomes was also created.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Individual models that showed most significance were aneurysm sac enlargement at 1-year post EVAR (n=411; Sensitivity=1; Specificity=0.47; Accuracy 0.48) and reintervention at 2-year post EVAR (n=494; Sensitivity=1; Specificity=0.42; Accuracy=0.45).  Notably, our models reported that increasing iliac artery diameter and increasing aortic neck angle increased the risk for a reintervention, while increasing iliac artery tortuosity increased the risk for a type I/III endoleak.

The objective of this study was to determine whether there were any predictors for HD access failure in this population.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative database was queried to identify all new HD access cases performed by a single surgeon from January 2011 &ndash; December 2013. The primary outcome of interest was access failure as defined at follow-up. Secondary outcomes included necessity for access revision via surgical or interventional (percutaneous) techniques. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with access failure and need for revision. Age, gender, race, smoking status, diabetes, BMI &ge; 30, presence of a central venous catheter, dialysis status, and access type were included in the model.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:During the study period, 1,354 HD access cases were performed, with n = 1,238 (91.4%) of these autogenous arteriovenous fistulae (AVF), and the remainder prosthetic (n = 57; 4.2%) or biologic (n = 59, 4.4%) arteriovenous grafts (AVG).

This data suggests that patients with CKD who are 'pre-dialysis,' in which there is any suspicion for progression to ESRD requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), should receive more aggressive surgical referral and proactive placement of AVF prior to initiating any form of RRT.  Additionally, given the &gt; 2X likelihood for reintervention, patients that receive biologic AVG may be better suited with other access modalities.  However, this cohort in particular may have specific anatomical limitations or have expended other access options, which may preclude AVF creation or the use of more conventional synthetic graft materials.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Formation and renewal of intramural thrombus is also associated with inflammation, and is known to contribute to the complexity of aneurysm repair.  Current cardiovascular pharmacotherapy includes a number of inflammatory modulators such as aspirin (ASA), Plavix (clopidogrel), statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). The purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of these inflammatory modulators on radiographically-determined thrombus sac volume (TSV).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who underwent elective infrarenal aortic repair were identified. Pre-operative CT scans were reviewed, and TSV was obtained using a Hounsfield Unit (HU) restricted region growth algorithm.

The effect of ASA over other anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet agents is possibly attributable to its distinct mechanism of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition. These data suggesting a key role of COX-1 in aneurysm thrombus modulation. DM, a known correlate of aneurysm incidence, is not related to thrombus burden. The potential to alter aneurysm thrombus volume affecting aneurysm morphology may yield a more favorable aneurysmal repair.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Previous studies have demonstrated significant differences between hospital ranking systems. We hypothesize that there will be similar differences between surgeon ranking systems, and that hospital specialty ranking will not correlate with the average ranking of its surgeons in a particular specialty.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The U.S. News &amp; World Report (USNWR) hospital scores in orthopedics, urology, gastroenterology &amp; GI surgery, and cardiac care areas were selected as the basis for comparison. The USNWR scores were averaged, and the top 10 hospitals in each specialty were ranked based on the mean score. Hospitals included in this list were identified in ProPublica's (PP) Surgeon Scorecard and Consumer's Checkbook's (CC) SurgeonRatings.org websites. Both sites analyze physician outcomes based on Medicare billing data from 2009-2013 (PP) or 2009-2012 (CC), and USNWR scores incorporated Medicare data from the same time-frame. For each website we recorded each surgeon&#39;s score by specialty area, and these scores were then averaged to generate the mean surgeon score at an institution. The mean surgeon score was then used to rank institution-level performance in order to examine the correlation between the PP and CC rating systems, as well as between each of the two rating systems and USNWR. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Compared to averaged USNWR institution rankings in orthopedics and urology, PP rankings had correlation coefficients of 0.33 (p=0.4) and -0.59 (p=0.1).

Average surgeon rankings in a specialty do not correlate well with hospital rankings using either of the publicly available surgeon ranking tools.

Variances include near misses (unplanned events that fail to cause patient harm, but had the potential to do so) and adverse events (unplanned events cause actual patient harm).  To capture as many variances as possible, we have both electronic and handwritten variance reporting systems in place.  The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate variances that occur in our pediatric operating room and to compare these variances to the two established incident reporting systems in our hospital.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In this prospective observational study, trained individuals directly observed pediatric perioperative patient care for six weeks to identify near misses and adverse events in domains including timeout, medication, equipment, blood bank, surgical counts, and isolation. These direct safety observations were compared to the handwritten perioperative variance reporting system and the electronic hospital variance reporting system.  All observations were analyzed and categorized into an additional six safety domains (adverse event, near miss, safety process issue, non-safety issue, indeterminate, good job) and five variance categories (equipment/supplies, knowledge/attitude, policies/process, environment, operations, other). The chi-square test was used, and p-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Out of 211 observed cases, 137 near misses were identified by trained observers, while 57 handwritten variance reports and 8 electronic reports were filed during the same time period. Only 2 of 137 observed events were also reported in the handwritten or electronic system.  Five observed adverse events were not reported in either of the two incident reporting systems. Safety observers were more likely to recognize timeout and equipment variances (graph). Both handwritten variance cards and safety observers identified numerous policy and process issues. The electronic variance system was used infrequently and most often to report intentional incorrect counts.  All systems addressed knowledge/attitude and policy/process issues most often and there were no differences for frequency of safety categories (P=0.19).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Despite multiple reporting systems, near misses and adverse events are vastly underreported.  By identifying and addressing near misses, the underlying causes of system and processes can be corrected before they lead to an adverse event. Efforts need to be made to lessen barriers to variance reporting in order to improve patient safety.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

In 2013, we began providing individualized feedback to general surgery residents about their VTE prophylaxis prescribing habits which has improved VTE prevention on the general surgery services. We hypothesized that this feedback would also improve VTE prophylaxis prescription by the same residents during non-general surgery rotations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the indirect, or 'halo,' effect of providing individualized feedback to residents regarding prescription of appropriate VTE prophylaxis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This retrospective cohort study compared appropriate VTE prophylaxis prescription for all patients admitted to the adult trauma service from July 1, 2012 &ndash; May 31, 2015 at a Level 1 trauma center. On October 1, 2013, we began providing monthly feedback to general surgery residents regarding their VTE prophylaxis prescribing habits while on general surgery rotations. Data were not provided about off-service practice nor to any other prescribers within the hospital. We compared performance of surgery residents rotating on the adult trauma service before and after they began receiving individualized feedback. We also compared the performance of general surgery residents to all other prescribers (e.g. non-categorical interns, rotating residents, nurse practitioners) who wrote VTE prophylaxis orders on the adult trauma service during the study period.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the study period, 931 patients were admitted to the adult trauma service and assessed using the trauma-specific risk assessment tool. During the 15-month pre-feedback period, surgery residents wrote appropriate VTE prophylaxis orders for 78.5% trauma patients and other prescribers wrote appropriate orders for 75.4% patients, p=0.441. Surgery residents' ordering practice for trauma patients significantly improved during the 20-month post-feedback period (94.5% vs 78.5%, p&lt;0.001). Practice significantly improved among other prescribers during the post-feedback period, as well (84.3% vs 75.4%, p=0.036); however, practice was significantly better among surgery residents compared with other prescribers (94.5% vs 84.3%, p=0.001). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Individualized resident feedback has been shown to directly improve VTE prescribing practice. We found a beneficial 'halo' effect for other patients treated by those residents. There is a secondary, albeit smaller, 'halo' effect for patients treated by prescribers who may be aware of the feedback project despite not directly receiving feedback.

We aimed to identify potential flaws in the execution of a local, stakeholder-derived SSC, which could lead to its ineffectiveness.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  From May to July 2015, five trained observers directly observed the completion of 11 pre-induction, 19 pre-incision, and 9 debriefing checkpoints during the three-phase SSC for pediatric operations. All checkpoints were assessed for adherence (checking the box). Of the 19 pre-incision checkpoints, 10 were assessed for high fidelity performance (meaningful completion). These fidelity checkpoints represent complex measurable tasks relying on a high-level of team cohesion and communication for meaningful completion. Inter-rater reliability and chi-squared tests were performed; p-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 212 pediatric operations were observed representing 35 surgeons and 9 surgical subspecialties. At least one phase of the SSC was conducted in 100% of cases. 174 pre-induction, 212 pre-incision, and 199 debrief checklists were evaluated with an average adherence to each checklist of 56%, 95%, and 76%, respectively. For the pre-incision phase, adherence to checkpoint completion ranged from 85-100% and averaged 95%, yet high fidelity performance ranged from 36-98% and averaged 75%. Three pre-incision checkpoints (induction concerns, anticipated case duration, and site marking) were performed most consistently with associated meaningful completion. However, 7 checkpoints were performed at a high frequency (range 85-99%) but had a significantly lower rate of fidelity (range 36-86%, p&lt;0.05). Inter-rater reliability kappa values for pre-induction, pre-incision, and debriefing were 0.68, 0.70, and 0.89, respectively.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although surgical safety checklists are routinely performed, meaningful execution of each and every step remains suboptimal.

The equipment needed for these procedures is complex and very much dependent on the size of the patients. Many hospitals encounter challenges related to the management, maintenance and emergent assembly of this equipment.  For the past 30 years this equipment at our Children's Hospital was maintained in an 'endoscopy cart' with 6 drawers. Similar items like lenses or graspers were collocated in the same drawer. This system was prone to problems, as the instruments in the drawers were difficult to manage. The cart was located outside of the Sterile Processing Department (SPD), which led to a lot of variability and required additional operators for maintenance. It was our goal to create a safer and more standardized way of maintaining this equipment using the Toyota Lean management principles.                   <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   As a surrogate measure of motion and possible breakage, we measured the number of drawers that needed to be opened and how many lenses and instruments needed to be touched for a setup. We also measured whether the operating room (OR) technician was able to produce a functioning setup for a patient of a certain age and weight, and the time to completion of the setup.  We then performed a 2 day workshop including surgeons, staff from OR and SPD, following the Toyota Lean principles and subsequently repeated the measurements. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  We performed (n=7) pre-workshop measures. These showed averages of 9.7 drawers opened, 4.6 lenses touched, 9.7 instruments touched, and a time to setup of  325 seconds. None of the setups were functional.   After observation of the process the system was changed to a mobile open-shelf system containing patient-age specific instrument trays. The age groups (0-6 months; over 6 months) were chosen based on our utilization over the past 2 years. Matching sizes of lenses, scopes and graspers were color labeled and collocated in the trays.  Immediately after the improvement workshop, different OR technicians produced the following numbers: For a complete setup 0 drawers needed to be opened, 2 lenses touched, 4 instruments touched, and average time to setup was reduced to 105 seconds. All setups were functional.  These improvements have been sustained for 2 years.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Despite initial hesitancy to change an established but broken system, this improvement work was made possible through engagement of the key stakeholders. We applied Toyota Lean principles (visual management, kit building, less over processing and elimination of waste) to mistake proof the management and assembly of this delicate and high-risk endoscopy equipment. Our work lead to a 3fold reduction of setup time and 100% improvement of defect free equipment assembly.  The new tray system requires less time for management and setup and has reduced the defect rate, even by less experienced operators, to near zero.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

We sought to create a mentorship program in order to create a bi-directional forum for increasing QI awareness and knowledge and to facilitate a culture of continuous quality improvement.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  At the start of the 2014 academic year, a natural experiment in quality education was performed. Each PGY1 categorical surgical resident in a large university-based academic program was paired with a faculty mentor who was also a representative to a unit-based clinical leadership (UBCL) team. The ACS NSQIP QITI Practical QI Curriculum was distributed to both faculty and residents and participation in QI activities was encouraged, however no additional didactics were given. A 15-point surgery-specific modified QI-Knowledge Application Tool was administered at the start and end of the year. Informal feedback on participation in QI activities was also solicited.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: On average, the 7 pairs met four times over a 9 month period. Fourteen participants completed the pre-program knowledge test, 10 completed the post-test. There was significant improvement over the time period (mean pre: 10.4 (2.6), post: 12.2 (1.3) p&lt;0.05). Mentors had a higher mean pre-program score (11.3) than residents (9.4, p=0.2), but residents had higher mean post-program scores (12.6 vs 11.8, p=0.4). All participants demonstrated an improved understanding of the importance of risk-adjustment in benchmarking (57% pre, 100% post). Participant responses illustrated the fundamental need for data in the QI process, but lacked a practical understand of discrete data sources. Five of 7 residents attended UBCL meetings and had QI projects in development.

Preoperative patient education and postoperative diet plans in bariatric surgery centers emphasize strategies to optimize postoperative oral hydration. Despite this, the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) national database notes readmission rates for dehydration 1.3% and 1% for Laparoscopic Roux-en-y Gastric Bypass(LRYGB), and 1.7% and 1.3% for Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy(LSG) for 2013 and 2014, respectively. Dehydration after bariatric surgery is a patient safety issue. In addition to clinical concerns, dehydration and associated inpatient medical costs present a financial burden to hospitals.We identified dehydration readmissions as a potentially reducible complication in our institution. In 2014, we initiated a quality improvement project to develop an outpatient rehydration protocol at an infusion center.In addition to standard post-operative follow-up, at-risk patients are identified via routine post-discharge phone calls from bariatric inpatient nurses. The patients are asked screening questions regarding hydration status and oral intake. Patients are then evaluated by bariatric practice APRN. Clinically stable dehydrated patients undergo same day lab work and outpatient fluid resuscitation. A post-infusion evaluation is performed. The patient is followed as an outpatient or admitted to the hospital, as appropriate. We hypothesized that implementation of an outpatient infusion protocol would decrease hospital readmissions related to dehydration in post-bariatric surgical patients. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Retrospective review of patients who underwent LSG and LRYGB at an academic teaching hospital in 2013 and 2014 who presented with dehydration. The number of readmissions for dehydration in 2013 (pre protocol) and 2014 (post protocol) was determined, as was the number of patients managed via the infusion center. These data are compared to MBSAQIP national data. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In 2013, 3.0% of LRYGB (5 of 164) patients and 2.4% of LSG (5 of 212) patients required readmission for dehydration (2.6% overall).  After implementation of the infusion center in 2014, 13 patients were identified in screening: 2 were readmitted directly, on protocol, 11 patients were referred for infusions; 7 were managed as outpatients, 4 were readmitted.    0.9% of LRYGB (1 of 110) patients and 1.7% of LSG (5 of 303) patients required readmission (1.45% overall).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Implementation of a coordinated outpatient rehydration protocol for post-bariatric surgical patients reduced the readmissions at our institution by 40% (44% rate reduction).  These rates of readmission compares favorably to national risk-adjusted MBSAQIP benchmarks.

With the rapidly aging population, the incidence of injury from ground level falls has surpassed that for motor vehicle crashes. Although most falls cause minor injuries, 20-30% are severe resulting in significant physical impairment, and elderly hospitalized for severe fall-related injuries have a 50% mortality rate. Many health and environmental factors contribute to fall risk in the elderly, however the most predictive risk factor is a prior fall. The CDC has emphasized the importance of injury prevention through identification of risk and intervention. In patients with severe injuries due to a fall, we determined the incidence of fall assessment and prevention during previous hospital encounters. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a retrospective review of adult (&ge;65 years of age) trauma patients with severe injury (any AIS &ge; 3) admitted to our Level I center after a ground-level fall in 2014. We reviewed inpatient and clinic records to identify patients with previous admissions to our hospital, and recorded fall risk assessments and prevention efforts.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 5448 admissions, 214 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 79 (65-98), and 47% were male with an average ISS of 21 (16-42) and mortality 22%.  After chart review, previous admissions were found in 39 (18%), most within 10 years. All 2014 admissions were for severe head injury (AIS &gt; 3) and had a median length of stay of 6 days. Median age was 80 (65-98), 54% were male, and the average ISS was 22 with mortality of 10%. The 39 patients had a total of 66 prior encounters, an average of 1.7 per patient. Prior admissions were for injuries (fall, MVC, stroke) and medical illness (cardiac, cancer, infection). Fall education or intervention was not documented in 68% of the patient encounters and in 4 of the 12 patients with a known history of falls.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: As people age, physiological changes and illness affect gate and balance, increasing the risk for falls. Patients with falls are known to be at highest risk for subsequent falls, and potentially fatal injury. We have demonstrated that our institution only documented appropriate risk identification and intervention in 46% of high risk patients. Many elderly patients presenting with a major fall-related injury had not received appropriate intervention during previous encounters, which demonstrates a missed opportunity for injury prevention.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Distractions in the operating room can impair and/or interrupt these hallmarks as well as increase surgeon stress and fatigue, potentially compromising patient safety.

We aimed to characterize interruptions in pediatric operating rooms in order to identify areas for intervention.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Over an eight week period, a prospective, direct observational study was performed by five trained observers in an academic children's hospital. Convenience sampling was performed across all pediatric surgical specialties. The number of phone calls, people entering, pages/text messages, equipment failures, and other events that interrupted workflow were recorded. Interruptions were further defined as essential or non-essential based on their contribution to patient care. Interruptions were analyzed in relation to surgical subspecialty and case duration.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 208 operations were observed with a median (interquartile range) operating time of 40 (19-86) minutes. A total of 1,037 interruptions were recorded with a median of 2 (1-5) interruptions per case. People entering the operating room accounted for the highest proportion of interruptions (61%), where approximately one-third were non-essential (30.5%). Overall, 64% of all the interruptions were non-essential to patient care (Figure). In total, 63% of the operations had at least one non-essential interruption.

The impact of these distractions on patient safety remains unknown. Although no single interruption was observed to cause direct patient harm, patient safety in the operating room may be optimized through awareness, education, and limiting non-essential interruptions. Future interventions should target eliminating non-essential interruptions and minimizing essential ones through prevention and process improvement.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Though several tools for structuring handoffs exist, none provide a concise, standardized framework for ensuring that patient acuity is efficiently and reliably communicated. This prompted the development of a novel tool, the Clinical Acuity Shorthand System (CLASS) for Surgery. This is a patient classification system that incorporates the acuity and severity of illness, phase of care, and key comorbidities into a score that can be used during transitions of care to summarize the overall wellness of the patient and convey the need for additional interventions.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Surgical trainees at a single center were asked to complete a voluntary, anonymous exam in which a novel patient classification system would be applied to 10 theoretical patient scenarios. Responses were scored on the accuracy of classification compared to target answers. Performance was evaluated overall and between groups of trainees; time required to complete the examination was also measured. Following completion of this exercise, respondents were surveyed regarding perceived utility of the system with regard to preventing medical errors and improving efficiency.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The study task was completed by 17 participants. Mean time from first exposure to the system to completion of the application task was 10.3 &plusmn; 8.4 minutes. Interns and junior residents were able to apply the system with comparable accuracy, and in fact exceeded the accuracy of senior residents. Most respondents indicated that such a system would be feasible to institute and could prevent medical errors arising from communication breakdowns.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:CLASS is a novel classification system that can be learned quickly and implemented readily by trainees, and can be used to convey key patient information concisely and with acceptable fidelity regardless of level of training. Further studies are necessary to determine whether CLASS has the potential to decrease the rate of communication-related medical errors during handoff.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Invasive arterial sampling has inherent risks to patients, and frequently may be replaced with less invasive monitoring tools. We aim to decrease ABG utilization for ventilatory monitoring by increasing the use of non-invasive end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Through multidisciplinary meetings, educational materials were developed and distributed to all SICU healthcare providers, including nursing staff, respiratory therapists, and surgical residents. This education focused on appropriate ABG utilization, the capabilities of ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring in managing mechanically ventilated patients, and the practical functionality of the ETCO<sub>2 </sub>devices. On September 1, 2014 a protocol mandating ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring for all ventilated patients was implemented in the SICU. Using our institution's Enterprise Data Warehouse, ABG and ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitor utilization data was collected for three months preceding and three months following our intervention.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Prior to our educational intervention, 5.63 ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitor recordings were documented per ventilator-day.  Post-intervention, 16.0 ETCO<sub>2</sub> recordings per ventilator-day were recorded. This difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.01) and represented a nearly three-fold increase in ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring. There was a trend towards decreased ABG utilization following our intervention, though this did not meet statistical significance (4.62 pre-intervention vs. 4.13 post-intervention, p=NS).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The increase in ETCO<sub>2</sub> utilization following our intervention represents the first step in a culture shift away from considerable reliance on ABG values for routine ventilatory monitoring and toward a less invasive monitoring practice. Though there was a trend towards decreased ABG utilization following intervention, failure to reach statistical significance likely reflects a lack of comfort among providers in rapidly abandoning an ingrained practice.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

To improve patient safety, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a checklist to be used at critical perioperative moments (induction, incision, and prior to the patient leaving the operating room (OR)). This meta-analysis examines the impact of the WHO surgical safety checklist on the incidences of overall complications, surgical site infections (SSI), unplanned return to the OR within 30 days, and overall mortality.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A comprehensive literature search of all published studies assessing the use of the WHO surgical safety checklist in patients undergoing surgery was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar (1966-2015). Keywords searched included 'World Health Organization', 'surgical checklist', and 'safety checklist'. Inclusion criteria were the use of the WHO surgical safety checklist in any surgical setting, with pre-implementation and post-implementation surgical outcome data. The incidence of various patient outcomes (total complications, SSIs, unplanned return to the OR within 30 days, and overall mortality) and adherence to safety measures (airway evaluation, use of pulse oximeter, presence of catheter lines, prophylactic antibiotics, confirmation of patient and surgical site, and sponge count) were analyzed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 10 studies involving 51,125 patients (27,490 prior to implementation and 23,635 patients after the implementation of the WHO surgical safety checklist) were analyzed. The implementation of the WHO surgical safety checklist significantly reduced the risk of total complications by 37.9% (RR = 0.621; 95%CI 0.519 &ndash; 0.742; p&lt;0.001), SSIs by 45.5% (RR = 0.545; 95%CI 0.416 &ndash; 0.714; p&lt;0.001), unplanned return to OR by 32.1% (RR = 0.679; 95%CI 0.484 &ndash; 0.954; p=0.025), and mortality by 15.3% (RR = 0.847; 95%CI, 0.752 &ndash; 0.954; p=0.006). There was also a significant increase in adherence to safety measures including airway evaluation, use of pulse oximetry, prophylactic antibiotics when necessary, confirmation of patient name and surgical site, and sponge count.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: The use of the WHO surgical safety checklist is associated with a significant reduction in post-operative complications and mortality. The WHO surgical safety checklist is a valuable tool that should be universally implemented in all surgical centers and utilized in all surgical patients. Additional studies are required to determine optimal strategies for implementation of the WHO surgical safety checklist in different healthcare settings and countries.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Leaphart<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Florida,Department Of Surgery,Jacksonville, FL, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Florida,College Of Nursing,Jacksonville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:   The electronic health record and limits on resident work hours have altered patterns of communication between physicians and nurses.  Effective handoffs between interdisciplinary teams and for teams transitioning from day to overnight call are important safety initiatives promoting quality patient care.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that communication is adversely affected by using electronic health records thereby potentially decreasing quality of patient care.  To assess the effects of the EHR and limited duty hours on communication patterns and handoffs, we measured paging volume and nature of calls for on-call interns in pre- and post-implementation periods of the EHR.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   After IRB approval, a data dictionary was created to standardize categories of on-call pages to interns.   A College of Nursing faculty member, blinded to the purposes of the study, categorized the data dictionary into emergent or non-emergent needs.  For on-call interns in General Surgery, a check sheet was created from the data dictionary and reviewed prior to implementation during overnight calls from 5 PM &ndash; 6 AM.  Volume of pages to on call interns was collated by hour and call type for an 8-week period (May &ndash;June 2015).  The data dictionary was used to compare call volume and type in a pre- and post-implementation period of the EHR.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Prior to implementation of the EHR, the most common reasons for intern pages were for order clarification (32%, n=82) and pain management (19%, n=50).  Highest call volume occurred between 8 PM -2 AM with only 19% of pages (50/260) determined to be for emergent needs.  Strikingly, after EHR implementation, Pareto analysis determined the highest reasons for call to be consult-related pages (29%,n=178), pain management (12%, n=74), and abnormal labs/test results/vital signs (12%, n=73), indicating that standardized order sets potentially decrease the need for order clarification.  Highest call volume post-EHR implementation occurred between 8 PM &ndash; 2 AM with 71% of pages determined as emergent.  Consistency of times for high volume paging in the pre- and post-EHR periods was determined to be related to hospital throughput and patient flow from the emergency department and operating room to the surgical floors.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although limited duty hours and EHR implementation may alter communication patterns between nurses and physicians, standardization of orders may improve clarity of patient needs and quality of care being provided.  Future efforts in improving delivery of care may focus on improved order sets with attention to specific patient needs.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Hospitals striving to become High Reliability Organizations must maximize safety protocol adherence and better understand sources of variability in heterogeneous OR settings. This study utilized a comprehensive auditing tool to analyze compliance and variation across the perioperative time-out process in a major metropolitan academic medical center.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Data were collected prospectively by 5 anonymous observers over 10 weeks. The auditing tool was developed by a multidisciplinary OR safety team with key stakeholders from anesthesiology, nursing, and surgery. The tool was a detailed checklist evaluating 3 phases of our time-out process: anesthesia, surgical (incision to closure), and debriefing (end of case before leaving the OR). The anesthesia time-out consisted of 7 criteria, the surgical consisted of 24 criteria, and the debriefing consisted of 10 criteria.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In total, 111 time-outs were observed (anesthesia n=29, surgical n=50, and debriefing n=32). The time-outs were initiated during 50 OR cases across 24 surgeons within 7 surgical service lines. Across all service lines, the percentage of time-out content captured in anesthesia, surgical, and debriefing time-outs was 97%, 82%, and 71%, respectively. Between service lines, there were wide variations in the completion rate of surgical and debriefing time-outs (Table 1). Anesthesia time-outs were performed by an attending physician 86% of the time and occurred prior to induction in 97% of cases. Surgical time-outs were performed by an attending physician 98% of the time and occurred prior to draping in 96% of cases. Debriefing time-outs were always performed by an attending physician. Capture rates of surgical content varied from 16% (asking team members to call attention to any problems seen during the case) to 50% (asking team members to introduce themselves by name and role) to 62% (asking team members to address any special considerations during the case) and 100% (naming the procedure and patient information). Finally, within the debriefing time-out, the name of the procedure and reconciling the surgical tool counts were addressed in 84% of cases, while all other content was completed at or below the rate of the debriefing taking place (69%).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This perioperative auditing tool discovered wide variation in protocol adherence between surgical service lines. This practical checklist will be the basis for future designed interventions to target specialty-specific areas of need to ensure patient safety and surgical team cohesiveness in the operating room.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Among the most dreaded surgical misadventures are retained surgical items (RSI). Difficult to intercept, a number of different surgical tools and accessories continue to be 'left behind', yet little is known about the natural history of patients who ultimately suffer the consequences of these surgical errors.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An exhaustive literature search identified a total of 281 case reports and series describing 299 incidents of RSI between 1953 and 2015. All available details regarding each reported case were tabulated and standardized into the following categories: (a) demographics; (b) anatomic location of the retained object; (c) type of retained item; (d) time to identification/removal; (e) associated complications; and (f) pathology findings. Results are presented as descriptive statistics and frequencies.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 299 RSI instances were tabulated. There were 107 males and 192 females, with average age of 47 years. The most common anatomic location was abdominal (113), paraspinal/spinal (33), thoracic (30), pelvic (28), cranial/facial (19), and extremity (12). Surgical sponge was the most common RSI type (180), followed by other types of gauze (64), plastic/tubing (14), surgical instrument (9), and needle (8). Median time to retrieval was 365 days (range, 0 to 16,790 days, 25%-75% IQR 60-1,825 days, Figure 1). Twenty-four cases (8%) involved 2 or more procedures. Almost all (281/299, 94%) objects were removed, and in 52 instances (17%) bowel or other organ resection was required. Median RSI-attributable hospital length of stay was 7 days.

The models of PN are diverse, and are often designed to prevent the marginalization of patients of low socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minority groups. Herein we examine the literature assessing the efficacy of PN for patients with malignancies undergoing treatment.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The review was conducted according to the recommendations of the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group with pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data abstraction examined efficacy measurements, patient demographics, barriers to access, quality measures and models of patient navigation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library and EMBASE. A total of 4029 citations were collected in Refworks, yielding 27 relevant articles, 19 published papers and 8 abstracts. Navigation was performed for patients with breast, gynecologic, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, and prostate cancer treatment. Four articles do not specify type of cancer treatment. When examining ethnicity, 27.9% Hispanics (SD +/- 15), 30.9% Blacks (SD +/-16), 46.4% Whites (SD +/- 23), 4.6% Asian (SD +/- 3), 9.5% Other (SD +/- 14) participated. Three articles had 100% Native American participation. On average, 60.3% of patients spoke English (SD+/- 22), 44.5% spoke Spanish (SD +/- 13) and 16% fell under the category of Other (SD +/- 13). The average mean age of patients was 58.4 years (SD +/- 6). Analysis of quality measures showed that PN alleviated financial barriers (10 articles), coordination of care (7 articles) and transportation barriers (7 articles). When averaged, the mean days from diagnosis to treatment was 38.54 +/- 16 with PN compared to 45.31 +/- 18 days for the control groups. The median days from diagnosis to treatment was 36 +/- 11 with PN compared to 44.75 +/- 11 days for the non-navigated group (Table 1). Palliative care was not examined in any studies.   <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>::  A majority of patients benefitting from PN were a member of a minority racial/ethnic group, and a large portion was non-English speaking.  Most patients in PN programs held a breast cancer diagnosis, but colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers were common as well.  Overall, patients receiving navigation initiated treatment sooner than did their non-navigated counterparts.  The efficacy of PN warrants further study of its various models and exploration of how PN can be expanded to include both curative and palliative treatment for patients.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Holcomb<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Health Science Center At Houston,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Compliance with recommended guidelines is associated with improved patient outcomes, however achieving high levels of compliance has proven difficult in clinical practice.   The creation of automated clinical decision support systems (CDSS) to assist with guideline compliance has been met with the criticism due to failure to follow human factors principles.  A patient dashboard that displays integrated information automatically extracted from the electronic health record has recently been implemented in our surgical intensive care unit (ICU).  The status of compliance with certain bundles of care is displayed in a color-coded fashion (green-good, red-bad); the contribution to the cognitive load of the user and alarm fatigue is minimal as it does not generate any noise, page or text.  We hypothesized that the presence of a real-time, color-coded passive display of compliance status would improve compliance rates with Foley care guidelines in our surgical ICU.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This observational study was conducted in a 23-bed surgical ICU.  Compliance with Foley care guidelines were evaluated pre-implementation (2 months) and post-implementation (1 month) of a real-time display of compliance status.   A compliance score was calculated by dividing the total number of interventions achieved by the total number of opportunities for interventions and is expressed as a percentage.  For this study, the numerator is the total number of nursing shifts in which patients with a Foley received the proper Foley care.  The denominator is the total number of nursing shifts in which a patient had a Foley.  Foleys that were inserted and discontinued within one 12-hour shift and in and out catheters were excluded from the analysis.  Compliance rates were evaluated overall, as well as day/night shifts and weekend/weekday shifts.  Categorical variables were analyzed using the Pearson's &chi;2 test and with simple logistic regression.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  The overall pre-implementation compliance rate was 90% (1631/1810), compared with post-implementation compliance rate of 94% (792/843).  The implementation of a passive display of compliance status via the patient dashboard was associated with increased compliance with Foley care guidelines (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4, p = 0.001).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The introduction of a color-coded, consistently present display reporting the compliance status improved compliance rates with Foley care guidelines.  This assistance occurred without changing the workflow, requiring additional action from the user or increasing physician alerts, phone calls/pages, or noise.

There are plans to extend the CRRP to selected surgical populations. However, the odds of unplanned readmission have been shown, in some surgical settings, to be associated with lack of insurance and Black race. These characteristics are also associated with greater odds of injury, which raises the possibility that trauma centers will be unfairly penalized by extension of the CRRP to include injured patients.This study characterized the reasons for, and factors associated with, unplanned 30-day readmission of orthopedic trauma patients. We also sought to understand whether it is sufficient to limit measurement of readmissions to the hospital at which patients were initially treated by exploring the proportion that were readmitted to other hospitals. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Hospital admissions for fracture and/or dislocation (ICD-9-CM 800-839) were extracted from the California State Inpatient Database (SID) 2007-2011, which is an all-payer dataset that captures 98% of hospital admissions. Isolated rib, skull, and facial fractures were excluded. Unplanned readmissions to any hospital in California were tracked using a unique statewide identifier. Multivariable logistic and generalized linear regression models were used to identify independent associations with readmission. The covariates within these models were age, sex, race, payer status, admission source, weekend admission, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), hospital bed size, trauma center designation, and teaching hospital status. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 416,568 orthopedic trauma admissions to 391 different hospitals.

Severely injured patients (&ge;15) accounted for only 3.3% cases. 27,008 (6.5%) were readmitted within 30 days, 27.6% of which to a different hospital. Factors significantly associated with 30-day readmission were older age (&gt;65 adjusted odds ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.24-1.41), Black race (aOR 1.18, 1.10-1.26), public insurance (aOR 1.40, 1.27-1.54), greater comorbidity burden (CCI &gt;2 aOR 1.09, 1.77-1.89), and spine fracture (aOR 1.38, 1.31-1.45). Major reasons for readmission included cardiopulmonary disease (25.9%), procedural complications (12.8%), and musculoskeletal problems (8.5%). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Many orthopedic trauma readmissions are for cardiopulmonary disease and potentially unrelated to the quality of their index hospitalization. Penalties for unplanned readmissions risk unfairly penalizing hospitals that serve disadvantaged communities and treat a high proportion of trauma patients. Future work should aim to determine the proportion of readmissions that are truly avoidable given optimal trauma and medical care.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

In contrast to the traditional fee-for-service paradigm, under the BPCI hospitals are reimbursed a DRG-specific bundled payment including physician and inpatient fees for a single episode of care. Still in its infancy, little is known regarding the potential effects of the BPCI on hospital payments and net margins. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential effects of the BPCI on net margins among Medicare patients undergoing colectomy at a tertiary care hospital.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Medicare enrollees undergoing elective colectomy between 2009 and 2013 were identified using DRG and ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. Total hospital costs and net payments were inflation adjusted and reported as 2013 dollars. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to calculate risk-adjusted, DRG-specific hospital costs and payments for each patient. Net margins were calculated as the difference between total hospital costs and total payments received.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 821 Medicare enrollees underwent an elective colectomy and met inclusion criteria. The median age of patients was 69 years (IQR 65-74) with 48.7% being male and 67.6% presenting with one or more comorbidity. Postoperative complications were observed among 27.5% of patients. The median length of stay (LOS) was 8 days (IQR 5-14) and over a fourth of patients were discharged with additional care (27.5%). The median risk-adjusted cost among all patients was $25,202 (IQR $17,164-$42,161). Risk-adjusted costs were higher among patients who developed a postoperative complication ($43,489 [IQR $30,325-$70,885] vs. $21,179 [IQR $15,368-$32,307], p&lt;0.001) and among patients with an Observed: Expected LOS&gt;1 ($38,361 [IQR $26,187-$58,631] vs. $17,697 [IQR $13,414-$24,129], p&lt;0.001). The median payment under the fee-for-service structure was $29,684 (IQR $19,609-$47,874) resulting in an overall net margin of $4,557 (IQR $1,254-$8,805), with 18.2% of patients contributing to an overall negative margin. In contrast, under the bundled payment paradigm, the net margin per patient decreased to $3,777 (IQR $-12,219-$11,825, p&lt;0.001) with over 41% of patients contributing to a net negative margin (Figure).<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Postoperative complications, length of stay and total hospital costs strongly correlated with hospital costs. Payments under the bundled payments system were lower and the proportion of patients contributing to a net negative margin increased. Further study is warranted to define the impact of bundled payments on quality of care, as well as hospital finances.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Early ambulation is associated with decreased venous thromboembolism (VTE), atelectasis, urinary retention, and length of stay, as well as increased patient satisfaction, improved pain control and return of bowel function. Patients deserve to be active participants in facilitating a safe and swift postoperative recovery. We focused on an early ambulation initiative to reduce postoperative VTE in the colorectal surgery population.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients &ge;18 years of age undergoing elective procedures from one large private colorectal surgery practice were enrolled from October 2014-March 2015. Starting at the pre-surgical visit and continuing in the pre-operative area, patients were educated on the importance of early ambulation on recovery after surgery. Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) nursing and staff ambulated patients 100 feet within 1 hour of reaching PACU. An interim analysis using retrospective chart review from the Electronic Medical Record and Premier Quality Database compared patient outcomes 6 months pre-implementation versus 6 months post-implementation; outcomes were compared overall then stratified among patients receiving open, laparoscopic, or robotic-assisted procedures. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were calculated with an intent-to-treat analysis. All patients meeting inclusion criteria in the post-ambulation period were included in the analysis, regardless of ambulation status. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 72 /279 (25.8%) patients successfully ambulated in the PACU. The mean ambulation distance was 128 feet. Team members overcame skepticism related to the safety of this endeavor and the constraints of limited available time for 'bedside nursing' by engaging all key stakeholders including: patients and families, perioperative nursing staff, anesthesia services, and the surgical team. Characteristics of pre-implementation patients (N=279) were similar to post-implementation (N=228), including age, body mass index, fall risk scores, surgeons, and procedure types. During the first 6 months of the colorectal mobility initiative, there were no postoperative VTE occurrences, compared to 5 VTE events pre-implementation. Although this reduction does not reach statistical significance, it represents a clinically meaningful improvement and a strong trend (1.8% vs. 0%, p=0.07). Postoperative infections were reduced from 29% to 23% (p=0.09), with a significant infection reduction in laparoscopic procedures (28% vs. 14%, p=0.05). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Results of the mobility initiative demonstrate that early postoperative ambulation can be accomplished safely. While the observed VTE reduction has not yet achieved statistical significance, meaningful trends have emerged in decreasing VTE and surgical site infections.  Large-scale implementation and further evaluation is ongoing at our institution to determine if the trend will continue.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

We aimed to determine the impact of a clinical care pathway for appendicitis, implemented at our children's hospital in 2011, on length of stay, readmissions, and complications.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Pre-pathway data were compared to data from prospectively-monitored care pathways for all pediatric patients (&lt;18 years) who underwent an appendectomy for acute appendicitis between June 2009 &ndash; December 2010 (pre-pathway) and January 2011 &ndash; May 2015 (pathway). Separate pathways were implemented for simple and complicated (gangrenous or perforated) appendicitis patients. Clinical outcomes including surgical site infections (SSI), initial and aggregate 30-day hospital length of stay (LOS), and readmissions within 30 postoperative days were recorded. Chi-squared, Student's t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and multivariate regression were performed; p-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 2151 patients (pre-pathway: 582, pathway: 1569) underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis from June 2009 &ndash; May 2015.

There were no significant differences in outcomes for complicated appendicitis pathway patients. On multivariate regression analysis of patients with simple appendicitis, the pathway predicted shorter LOS; younger age and public insurance predicted increased LOS and SSI (Table). For complicated appendicitis patients, laparoscopic appendectomy was associated with decreased LOS; there were no significant predictors of SSI or readmissions.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Clinical pathways do not appear to substantially improve outcomes in pediatric appendicitis. Within our institution, the clinical pathway for simple appendicitis patients was associated with decreased initial and aggregate 30-day LOS, but increased readmissions, whereas the complicated appendicitis pathway was not associated with any improvements. Further efforts should target decreasing readmissions for simple appendicitis patients and determining the impact of pathways on hospital resource utilization. Although there are many benefits to protocolized care, the true efficacy of increasing standardization may lie in process improvement and not directly related to patient outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

However, L1TCs typically host many complex services and manage a high volume of critically unwell patients. It is therefore possible that some clinical pathways will be disrupted in L1TCs and that vulnerable patient groups might compete ineffectively for resources with higher priority cases. There is emerging evidence that appendectomy for acute appendicitis is delayed in L1TCs with an associated increased rate of complications. Studies from the UK and the Netherlands have also reported that the care of older adults with hip fractures may be compromised in new trauma centres.Our study sought to compare hip fracture outcomes between L1TCs and non-trauma hospitals (NTHs) to determine whether &quot;routine&quot; trauma is underprioritized in mature higher level trauma centers.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Hip fracture cases were identified from the California State Inpatient Database (SID) 2007-2011. The California SID captures 98% of hospital admissions and a unique patient identifier permits admissions to be tracked across all hospitals in California. The inclusion criteria were age &ge;65 and an operatively treated hip fracture. To minimize selection bias, patients were excluded if they had any other injuries or were transferred between hospitals. Outcomes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression and generalized linear models for non-normally distributed data, adjusting for patient- (age, sex, race, payer status, Charlson Co-morbidity Index, weekend admission, admission source) and hospital-level (hospital bed size, teaching status) characteristics. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:91,401 hip fracture admissions were identified, 6,468 (7.1%) of which were admitted to L1TCs and 61,896 (67.7%) to NTHs. The remaining patients (25.2%) were treated in lower level trauma centers.The delay between admission and operation was longer in L1TCs (median 1 day; 90<sup>th</sup> percentile 3 days) than in NTHs (median 1 day; 90<sup>th</sup> percentile 2 days, Kruskall-Wallis p&lt;0.001). Within a generalized linear model, operative delay was 0.29 (95% CI 0.08-0.51) days longer in L1TCs relative to NTHs. Length of stay was also prolonged in L1TCs by 0.85 days (95% CI 0.30-1.40). Both the odds of venous thromboembolism (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.11-1.88) and unplanned 30-day readmission (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.24-1.80) were higher in L1TCs. There were no mortality differences between L1TCs and NTHs. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Operative treatment of hip fractures is delayed in L1TCs, which is associated with prolonged length of stay and increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and 30-day hospital readmission. Further work should aim to understand whether these findings can be explained by intense competition for resources (e.g. operating room time) and how clinical pathways for vulnerable populations can be optimized in L1TCs.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

The service allows for the users to send small messages called 'tweets,' that are limited to 140 characters. With the increasing popularity of social media, such as Twitter, there has been wide recognition that meta-data are a very significant source of information. Increasingly, patients are utilizing Twitter as an outlet for their medical concerns, and thus we decided to test the twittersphere as a potential means by which to collect and analyze patients' health sentiments in regards to cancer and surgical care.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A large sample of English tweets from March 2014 through December 2014 with imbedded location coordinates were obtained from the Twitter database. Using regular expression software pattern matching, the tweets were filtered by cancer diagnosis. For each cancer-specific tweetset, individual patients were extracted and the content of the tweet was categorized. The patients' Twitter identification numbers were used to gather all tweets for each patient, and happiness values for patient tweets were calculated using a quantitative hedonometric analysis. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The most frequently tweeted cancers were: breast (n=15421, 11% of total cancer tweets), lung (n=2928, 2.0%), prostate (n=1036, 0.7%) and colorectal (n=773, 0.5%). Patient tweets pertained to treatment course (n=73, 26%), diagnosis (n=65, 23%), and then surgery/biopsy (n=42, 15%). Computed happiness values for each cancer diagnosis revealed higher average happiness values for thyroid (h_avg =6.1625), breast (h_avg =6.1485) and lymphoma (h_avg =6.0977) cancers, and lower average happiness values for pancreatic (h_avg =5.8766), lung (h_avg =5.8733) and kidney (h_avg =5.8464) cancers. Data pertaining to cancer surgery tweets (n=1629, 1.1% of data set), show that patients (n=202) were more likely to express negative sentiments pre-operatively and more likely to express positive sentiments post-operatively.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The study confirms that patients are expressing themselves openly on social media about their illness and that unique cancer diagnoses are correlated with varying degrees of happiness. Twitter can be employed as a tool to identify patient needs and as a means to gauge the cancer patient experience. Tweets authored by patients are rich in content pertaining to active oncological and surgical treatment. These tweets differ in sentiment with respect to the patients' operative date and tweets could thus allow for following patients through their treatment journey, potentially highlighting opportunities for improvement in surgical healthcare delivery. This is essential in order to maximize care and patient experience in an era in which patient satisfaction is increasingly being tied to reimbursement.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Not least among these is Patient Satisfaction (PS).  Previous reports have shown that PS is driven less by clinical outcome, and more by hospital and post-operative experiences of care. Ironically, research has shown that increased PS is correlated with better clinical outcomes and more appropriate use of the health care system. The aim of this study was to determine if the patient and surgeon expectations of recovery from surgery to are aligned. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A 15-question Likert-style survey given to the patient and surgeon was deployed prospectively immediately following the conclusion of the pre-operative clinic visit. The survey encompassed multiple aspects of the patient's recovery from perception of health and wellness to anticipated pain medication requirements, to length of expected recovery. All patients were 18 years of age or older.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Statistical analyses were conducted using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test and McNemar's test as appropriate.  The results were predominately non-parametric using a Likert Survey. Surgeons expected patients to feel more prepared for surgery (p=0.001), be more likely to walk the day after surgery (p=0.01) have better tolerance of surgery (p=0.03) and a more likely ultimate return to activities of daily living (p=0.002) than patients did. Whereas patients expected both more pain (p=0.006), less/ no need for narcotics (p=0.05) than surgeons. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our study demonstrates that in our sample population, surgeons and patients have significantly different expectations of important outcomes immediately after the conversation that should ideally set those targets.

However, few studies have described the current state of qualitative surgical research. The present study is a comprehensive literature scope of qualitative surgical research to identify: (a) common approaches to qualitative surgical research; (b) gaps in the literature to inform future qualitative inquiry.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We searched PubMed using 'surgery' and 7 qualitative methodology search terms (Grounded Theory, Constant Comparative, Phenomenology, Content Analysis, Discourse Analysis, Case study, Ethnography). Exclusion criteria included: mixed-methodology, literature/systematic reviews, non-surgical studies, and non-English language studies. Extracted data included: methodology (e.g. grounded theory, case study), methods (e.g. interviews, observations), surgical specialty (e.g. transplant, surgical oncology) and participant population (e.g. patient, family, provider). Four researchers extracted study information for relevant abstracts, and a fifth researcher independently reviewed 10% of abstracts to determine inter-rater reliability.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 2,017 articles were reviewed. After removing duplicates, 39.4% articles were deemed relevant (N=795; &kappa;  = 0.74). The most common methodologies included: phenomenology (33.2%), grounded theory/constant comparative method (30.8%), and content analysis (24.7%). The most common approaches were interviews (82.8%) conducted with patients (62.3%). Sample sizes varied widely within methodologies (mean: 27, range: 1-797). The most common surgical specialties were transplant (14.8%) and surgical oncology (13.6%). Overall, 36.4% of studies were published in nursing journals, and 9% in surgical journals. Fewer than half of studies were published before 2011, thus over half have been published in just the last four years (52.3%).<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:Our results suggest that qualitative surgical research is gaining in popularity despite the majority of relevant studies being published in non-surgical journals. Notably, nearly two-thirds of studies utilized only two of the seven methodological approaches (grounded theory and phenomenology). Further surgical qualitative research should take advantage of a greater variety of approaches to provide insight into rare phenomena and social context. For example, qualitative inquiry can inform complex issues, such as health disparities and training needs that are relevant to the increasingly diverse patient and healthcare professional populations.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

While there are many predictive models and calculators targeting overall mortality in surgical populations, a focused analysis of these 'unexpected' deaths may provide valuable information. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The national ACS-NSQIP database from 2011-2012 was analyzed for all general and vascular surgery patients. NSQIP-calculated 30-day mortality risk was dichotomized at different levels, and the optimal cutoff point for 'low' vs. 'high' risk patients was established by the Youden Index, at which point the sum of sensitivity and specificity was maximized. Patients below the Youden-Index-derived mortality risk threshold were deemed low-risk (i.e. expected survivors); low risk patients who died within 30 days were considered 'unexpected deaths'. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify perioperative predictors of unexpected deaths. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 601,631 patients were analyzed. There were 8627 deaths overall (1.43%). The Youden-Index-derived cutoff point for 'expected' vs. 'unexpected' deaths occurred at a calculated pre-operative mortality risk of 1.4%. There were 994 deaths among low-risk patients (994/513702, or 0.19%), representing 11.5% (994/8627) of all deaths. In multivariable regression analyses, 19 unique variables were found to be independent predictors of unexpected deaths; the five strongest were: ASA 4 [OR=12.01, 95% CI: 5.09 &ndash; 28.33, p&lt;0.001]; ascites [OR=2.74 (1.21 &ndash; 6.20), p=0.015]; history of CHF [OR=2.64 (1.58 &ndash; 4.39), p&lt;0.001]; WBC &gt; 25 [OR=3.32 (1.54-7.15), p=0.002]; preoperative weight loss [OR=2.69 (1.81 &ndash; 4.01), p&lt;0.001].<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:More than 11% of deaths in the surgical population occurred in low-risk patients and may be considered 'unexpected'.

Our objectives were to (1) assess the needs, barriers and resource gaps to quality improvement in Illinois, (2) develop and implement novel approaches to facilitate Quality and Process Improvement (QI/PI), and (3) develop an extensive evaluation plan to examine the effectiveness of program implementation. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Fifty-three hospitals in Illinois were surveyed about their QI/PI needs and resources (Resource Survey), Board/leadership involvement in QI, safety culture (Safety Attitudes Questionnaire-SAQ), and the baseline knowledge of QI among individual clinicians and QI personnel (Quality Improvement- Knowledge Assessment Tool-QIKAT).  In addition, hospital site visits were conducted for in-depth qualitative assessments of QI resources and barriers. A combination of novel and evidence-based approaches were developed and implemented across all 53 ISQIC hospitals.  A mixed-methods approach was created to triangulate data from surveys, ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, artifact analyses and process mapping to measure the effectiveness of each newly implemented approach to QI.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:From the Resource Survey, hospitals commonly listed issues with insufficient financial resources, implementation of QI projects, communication and buy-in from leadership, and engagement among physicians. Hospital site visits revealed that surgeons were unsure how to lead QI programs or act upon data, whereas hospital administrators were concerned about startup costs associated with QI programs. Approximately 85% of respondents (n=950) for the SAQ rated their hospital favorably for teamwork and safety climate, but reported less favorably for perceptions of management and employee engagement. The average baseline test score (n=150) for knowledge of QI approaches from the QI-KAT was 65%.  To address the QI/PI needs, 21 novel approaches, grouped into 5 domains: guided implementation, education, comparative reports, networking, and funding, were implemented at each hospital (Table 1). Continuous evaluation using the tools developed to measure the effectiveness of each of the 21 individual approaches have allowed for iterative modification and improvement of approaches. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:By evaluating hospitals' needs, barriers, resources, and baseline QI/PI knowledge, we were able to design 21 approaches to facilitate rapid and effective QI in Illinois.

Traditional teaching holds that fever beyond the fourth postoperative day (POD #4) warrants blood culture, yet supportive evidence is scant. We gathered data from patients with postoperative blood cultures to assess whether the POD on which a maximum temperature (Tmax) occurred predicted positive culture results.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We reviewed records at a large tertiary care hospital in Northern Virginia of all non-pregnant adult patients who had blood cultures drawn within the first 10 days after surgical procedures in 2013. Differences in culture yield in relation to the POD on which fever occurred were assessed using Fisher's exact test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 5,418 blood cultures in 1,693 patients. Preliminary results based on 808 cultures from 306 patients (mean age 61.8 years, 51.9% women) identified 51 (6.3%) with organisms. Of these, 40 (4.9%) identified potential pathogens, while 11 were likely contaminants. The Tmax (mean 100.3&deg;F, range 94.5&deg;F-104.1&deg;F) prompting the greatest number of blood cultures occurred on POD #1 (n=162; 20.3%), but only 1 culture on this day was actually positive (0.6%) (Figure 1). The Tmax most frequently associated with positive cultures (14.3%) occurred on POD #6. Most positive cultures (75.0%) were drawn when Tmax occurred on POD #4 or later (p &lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The POD on which Tmax prompted blood cultures varied widely, and the overall yield of cultures was low. Pathogens were more often identified when Tmax occurred on POD #4 of later. Considering the yield and value of blood cultures, more judicious use of this resource could reduce the cost of postoperative care. Analysis of the complete dataset may identify other clinical predictors of pathogenic blood culture results and promote more efficient resource utilization.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Surgical flow disruptions (FD) are defined as 'deviations from the natural progression of an operation,' and have been empirically associated with surgical errors, adverse events, and inefficiency. Understanding the etiology of FD in robotic surgery will help target training techniques and identify opportunities for improvement. This study explored the relationships between surgeon console time (SCT), the number and types of FD, resident involvement, and other contextual parameters. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Thirty-two robotic surgery operations were observed over a six-week period at one 900-bed surgical center. Ten cases prior to this sampling were used to train two researchers and ensure high inter-rater reliability.The researchers observed FD throughout the time the patient was in the operating room. Each FD was designated with the time and a descriptor, and was then classified into one of 11 different categories: communication, coordination, external interruptions, training, equipment, environment, patient factors, surgical decision making, instrument changes, psychomotor error, and robot console switch. SCT, resident involvement, robot model, and procedure type were also recorded.Multi-variable statistics were used to evaluate the effects of these parameters on SCT and the number of FD.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Eight sacrocolpopexies, 21 prostatectomies, and 3 nephrectomies were observed. The mean number of FD was 48.2 (95% CI 38.6-54.8), and mean SCT was 163mins (95% CI 148-179). The Da Vinci S robot model was used in 14 cases, and the Si model was used in 18 cases. Nineteen cases involved residents, and 13 did not.There was a mean of 60.8 FD (95% CI 47.8-73.8) in resident cases and 29.8 FD (95% CI 22.1-37.5) in non-resident cases. Resident cases demonstrated mostly training, equipment, and robot switch FD, whereas non-resident cases demonstrated mostly equipment, instrument change, and external interruption FD. A linear regression (r<sup>2</sup>=0.34) demonstrated that residents had a significant effect on number of FD (p&lt;0.002), whereas robot model and procedure type demonstrated a non-significant effect.The mean SCT with residents was 165.8mins (95% 149.7-181.9) and without residents was 160.2mins (95% CI 130.1-190.3). A linear regression model (r<sup>2</sup>=0.35) found resident involvement and robot model to be non-significant parameters, while procedure type (p&lt;0.001) and total FD (p&lt;0.034) significantly affected SCT.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Resident involvement significantly increased the number of FD but did not affect SCT. This suggests that the FD encountered in resident training may not significantly affect operating time. Other FD, such as equipment issues or external interruptions, may be more impactful. Limiting these specific FD should be the focus of performance improvement efforts.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Improved outcomes are observed when these cases are discussed among tumor boards and treated by multidisciplinary referral centers. We hypothesize there is significant delay in referral of many patients with primary hepatobiliary malignancies to tertiary multidisciplinary teams. The purpose of this study was to identify areas of mismanagement leading to delayed referral and treatment of hepatobiliary malignancies.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review was performed of the patients referred to Liver Tumor Board from 2012-2014.  Treatment recommendations were made by representatives from surgical oncology, hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgery, transplant surgery, interventional radiology, radiation oncology and medical oncology. Gross areas of mismanagement were defined as: 1) serial imaging of growing hepatobiliary tumors; 2) dismissal of imaging with overt tumors and negative biopsy; 3) failure to establish follow-up after identification of index tumor; and 4) failure to refer patients with resectable tumors. Referring institution characteristics were analyzed to determine risk factors for delayed referral.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 208 patients, 80 (38%) were grossly mismanaged, most frequently because of definition 1 (49%) and definition 3 (26%). Risk factors for delayed referral included hospitals with less than 200 beds (OR-14.4, p&lt;0.001), hospitals without any tumor board (OR-53, p&lt;0.001), and hospitals without a surgeon specializing in oncology or HPB (OR-21.9, p&lt;0.001).  Cholangiocarcinoma was more frequently mismanaged than Hepatocellular carcinoma (OR-3 v 1.7).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The profound delay in referral of many patients with hepatobiliary malignancies compromises outcomes.  Efforts to improve physician awareness and understanding of these tumors can facilitate expedited access to multidisciplinary care.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Existing assessment tools use the availability of surgical procedures and resources to identify availability of surgical care. Such methods may fail to capture important information relevant to decision-making and resource allocation among providers, policymakers, and international development partners. This study seeks the relevant information gaps in a tool currently used to assess surgical capacity and explores a mixed methods approach to generate a more complete assessment of hospital surgical capacity.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  In June 2015, quantitative and qualitative research activities were conducted to assess emergency surgical care at a Ugandan Regional Referral Hospital. Infrastructure and human resources at a Regional Referral Hospital were assessed using the Surgeons OverSeas' Personnel, Infrastructure, Procedures, Equipment and Supplies (PIPES) tool, generating a standardized index and score. Thematic analysis was conducted on four semi-structured focus group discussions with 18 purposively sampled providers involved in the process of surgical care delivery. The process of emergency surgical care was directly observed using time-and-motion methodology over 53 consecutive days to produce a process map.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The PIPES tool identified major deficiencies in workforce and infrastructure; but not the cumulative impact of these deficiencies (e.g. lack of physical space) on the timeliness and process of care. The PIPES tool (see table) lacked indices to capture the in-hospital delays; barriers to accessing available procedures; effect of poor remuneration of providers on their availability at work; upshot of the 'no user fees policy' on patient throughput and quality of care. These were revealed in focus group discussions, midnight census and process mapping which also provided sociocultural context and the inimical effect of well-intentioned policies on the process of care. The PIPES tool understated the surgical workforce because it did not include orthopedic officers in its personnel assessment; this may misdirect training and capacity building efforts to only physicians or surgeons. The tool did not show the serious impact of the few unavailable procedures on patient throughput and access to care and may misrepresent the availability of services.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is a need to augment the information obtained from existing surgical care assessment tools. We recommend the use of direct observation of the process of care in combination with qualitative interviews that capture the providers&#39; experience in order to have a robust assessment of the process of surgical care, especially in developing countries where the systems and processes are less well understood.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Stith<sup>2</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Johns Hopkins University School Of Medicine,Surgery,Baltimore, MD, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of New Mexico,Albequerque, NM, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:   A pervasive viewpoint in healthcare is that higher patient volume leads to better outcomes, implying that facility volume can be used to identify high-quality hospitals.   Hundreds of studies documenting a positive correlation between hospital volume and patient outcomes (better outcomes at higher volume hospitals) have motivated the use of arbitrary minimum volume standards for elective surgical procedures.  There is considerable variation across minimum volume standards used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and commercial insurers when contracting with organ transplant centers.  It is unknown whether some payers are relying on excessively high standards or whether payers are using thresholds that are too small. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients including all adult heart (54,874 patients in 191 transplant centers) and lung (25,128 patients in 103 transplant centers) transplants in the United States from October 1987 - December 2012 to assess whether transplant outcomes including 1-year mortality and 1-year graft failure vary across centers above and below the minimum volume standards.  To account for potential confounding between unobserved patient characteristics and transplant center volume, we used an instrumental variables approach to predict volume of a patient&#39;s center with the volume of the center closest to a patient&#39;s home zip code. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Minimum volume thresholds affect many transplant centers.  Only 57% of kidney transplant centers, 71% of liver, 44% of heart, and 61% of lung transplant centers ever meet the highest minimum volume requirement during our study period.  We failed to find a significant relationship between transplant center volume and patient outcomes for either patient or graft survival for any of the four organs studied. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite good intentions, minimum volume standards currently used by public and private payers are not identifying higher quality transplant centers and may create unnecessary barriers for patients who could be served by smaller, closer centers.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Identifying which readmissions are preventable or unavoidable is challenging.  The ability to predict readmission rates at the time of discharge would potentially change clinical practice.  We hypothesize that patients experiencing a pre-discharge complication would have increased rates of readmission.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We examined all gastrointestinal surgery cases at 120 VA facilities from 2008-2014 with a total hospital length of stay of at least 2 days.  Our independent variable of interest was the occurrence of any pre-discharge complication as assessed by the VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program.  Our outcome of interest was inpatient readmission within 30 days following hospital discharge.  Chi-square tests statistics and t-tests were used to examine differences in bivariate statistics and a multivariate logistic model was used to model 30-day readmission in the population.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Our sample includes 86,820 procedures among 77,451 patients at 120 VA facilities with an overall readmission rate of (12.3%).  In our cohort, 7,927 patients (9.1%) experienced a pre-discharge complication.  Superficial wound infection was the most common pre-discharge complication (2.1%), followed by urinary tract infection (1.2%) and reintubation (1.2%).  Readmission rates were significantly higher in patients experiencing a pre-discharge complication when compared to those not experiencing an in-hospital complication (17.5% vs 11.8%, p&lt;0.01).  Patients who experienced a pre-discharge complication had a longer mean length of post-operative hospital stay (13.5 days) as compared to those without a pre-discharge complication (5.7 days, p&lt;0.01), but were no more likely to experience a post-discharge complication (7.1% vs. 6.6%, p=0.07). In the final adjusted model, pre-discharge complications were only associated with readmission when postoperative hospital stay was less than 7 days (OR=1.4, 95%CI=1.2-1.7), however only 11.5% of patients experiencing an in-hospital complication had a post-operative stay of less than 7 days.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Occurrence of pre-discharge complications in patients with postoperative length of stay greater than seven days was not associated with readmission suggesting that sequelae of the complication resolve during the prolonged index hospitalization for the majority of admissions.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

In a new geriatric optimization clinic for frail high-risk surgical patients, first year medical and nurse practitioner students were integrated into an interprofessional team as health coaches. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Frail surgical patients (those over the age of 80 or over the age of 60 with a geriatric syndrome) with planned elective operations were referred to a new geriatric pre-operative clinic to see a geriatrician, occupational therapist, physical therapist, and nutritionist. Students attended the entire clinic visit with the patient, reviewed the interdisciplinary care plan, attempted to call patients twice weekly preoperatively to promote adherence to care plans, and called weekly in the first month after discharge. They observed surgery and practiced physical exam and presentation skills during the inpatient stay. Students logged all calls and patients filled out health coach satisfaction surveys one week prior to surgery. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In the 6 month pilot period, two first year medical students, one nurse practitioner student, and two research assistants served as health coaches for 32 patients. On average, there were 30 days between the clinic visit and surgery. Patient received an average of 1 call per week. There were 39 instances when health coaches contacted members of the care team, 12 of which were to contact a doctor. These follow up communications were for medication questions, concerning symptoms, or remaining questions from clinic visits.

As part of a quality improvement initiative, we sought to better understand best practice techniques and preferences among operating room (OR) staff.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: One-hundred thirty-one anonymous paper surveys were distributed to all surgical and OR personnel who perform surgical hand antisepsis at either one or both of two hospital campuses. Participants represented all surgical specialties. The survey assessed product preference, product-specific patterns of use, hand antisepsis education and product knowledge.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 97 surveys (74%) were returned; two were incomplete and excluded. The remaining 95 surveys included 44 women (47%), 37 staff surgeons (39%), 29 residents and fellows (31%), and 29 nursing staff (30%). Ninety-five percent confirmed prior use and proper application of both product types, however application times of less than 1 minute for ABR and less than 3-6 minutes for TAS were reported by 10% and 18% of participants, respectively. The application time of each product was most influenced by case-specific wound classification and hand soiling. Among all users, 64% supported having an ABR option available. ABR was favored (52%) and did not differ between physicians and nursing staff (p = 0.67). Respondents preferred ABR for its ease of use (79%) and TAS for its minimal to no side effects (54%). Forty-eight percent had not read the manufacturer&#39;s instructions for either product, and over 80% had never received formal in-person training. While 73% of physicians reported familiarity with each product&#39;s active ingredients, less than one-third correctly identified alcohol's concentration of greatest anti-microbial activity or its mechanism of action, and only two-thirds correctly identified chlorhexidine&#39;s mechanism of action. Only 3 of 64 physician-respondents reported any familiarity with the Food and Drug Administration&#39;s Tentative Final Monograph.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:There were no strong preferences among staff regarding ABR or TAS but ABR was a supported option for surgical hand antisepsis. Preferred product features included ease of use and an acceptable side-effect profile. A definite lack of understanding and education exists regarding product mechanism of action and application.

However, the underlying reasons for these disparities are not well understood. One potential explanation is that minorities receive care in hospitals that are less likely to use minimally invasive approaches. We sought to examine racial disparities in the use of laparoscopic technology for colectomy and explore the contributing factors, including whether the differences in the use of the minimally invasive approach can be explained by the hospitals where minorities receive their care. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We studied all patients with colon cancer who underwent colectomy (N=112,183, N=1,901 hospitals) in the national Medicare population over 3 years (2010-2012). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between race and the use of the laparoscopic approach. In our analyses, we controlled for patient factors (age, gender, race and Elixhauser comorbidities), neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and the year of procedure. We present our results stratified by the degree of hospital segregation (i.e., quintiles of the concentration/proportion of blacks in the hospital). Moreover, we assessed the impact of hospitals on the use of laparoscopy by adjusting directly for them using fixed effects models.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In the national Medicare population, 37% of patients received a laparoscopic approach to colectomy. When examining the racial composition of the hospitals where these patients received care, there appeared to be a large degree of racial segregation. For example, the proportion of black patients in a hospital ranged from 0% in the bottom 20<sup>th</sup> percentile to 49.2% in the top 20<sup>th</sup> percentile. Black patients were 23% less likely to receive laparoscopic colectomy when compared to non-black patients (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.74-0.80). When each contributing factor was assessed independently using univariate analysis, 36% of the observed disparity in receiving laparoscopic colectomy was explained by the hospitals in which they received care (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82-0.89) and 39% was explained by SES (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83-0.89). After adjusting for differences in the hospitals where they received care, SES, and patient factors in a single model, we were able to explain 63% of the observed disparity, leaving 37% of the remaining disparity unexplained. However, even after adjusting for all these factors, black patients were still found to be 9% less likely to receive a laparoscopic colectomy compared to their non-black counterparts (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.87-0.96).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Black patients are less likely than non-black patients to have access to laparoscopic procedures for colon cancer.

The aim of this study was to gain insight into the beliefs of the local community regarding colon cancer screening and treatment.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  In partnership with a large urban university cancer center, medical students and surgical residents and faculty participated in two community health outreach events focused on cancer prevention, screening and treatment in the surrounding community. Prior to the main educational event, an 11- item survey that addressed commonly held cancer myths and colon cancer knowledge was distributed to all participants. Myth items were adapted from the National Cancer Institute's 'Common Cancer Myths and Misconceptions' website. The survey also collected demographic information and assessed participant willingness to undergo cancer screening (colonoscopy). Myth items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 'strongly agree to strongly disagree,' and knowledge items were scored as true/false or 'I don't know.' Descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were a total of 256 participants and 188 completed a survey (71% response rate). Attendees were predominantly insured (93%), female (80%) and African American (96%), with a mean age of 61 years (14.0; range 12-95 years). Seven percent of participants were unwilling to undergo a screening colonoscopy; 3% of those age &le;60 years compared to 9% &gt;60 years. Of those unwilling to get a colonoscopy, 33% were male, 92% Black. Of the myths, 25% felt that surgery could cause cancer to spread. Patients &le;60 years old were more likely to believe that surgery could cause cancer spread  (64% vs. 35% &le;60yrs; p=0.004). 25% endorsed mistrust in physicians (43% of those &le;60 years, 26% for those &gt;60 years (p=0.03). 18% felt that cancer treatment was worse than the disease. Belief in these myths did not differ by gender. 74% of participants agreed that there were some measures people could take to prevent cancer. 48% were aware of the causes of colon cancer, 49% and 46% misunderstood or didn't know the definitions of malignant and metastatic, respectively. Males were more unsure of these definitions than females (61% vs 55%, p=0.5 and 70% vs 55%; p=.01).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In the surrounding, predominantly African American community, knowledge of and willingness to undergo cancer prevention strategies was high. However, in participants &le;60 years, in which early detection of cancers is most beneficial, physician mistrust and belief in the surgical spread of cancer was also high. Particularly for cancers where surgery is the mainstay of treatment, surgeon participation in community outreach events is essential in order to minimize barriers to treatment, increase cancer-related knowledge and address disparities in care.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

While survival for White patients has improved, survival in select minority groups has worsened, thus widening the pre-existing gap. Biological factors have been well-studied, but it is not yet known if differences in breast cancer care contribute to worsening racial disparities. We aimed to evaluate differences in the receipt of transdisciplinary evidence-based breast cancer care for racial/ethnic minorities in California (2008-2009).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: California Cancer Registry (CCR) data were linked to state level inpatient and ambulatory surgery data and used to identify all women with an ICD-03 diagnosis of breast cancer who were treated during the years under study. We identified quality measures reflecting evidence-based care in the diagnosis, surgical treatments, and adjuvant treatments of breast cancer based on current literature and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. We evaluated the receipt of percutaneous versus excisional biopsy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy for tumor stage T4, chemotherapy for nodal stage N2, radiation therapy following lumpectomy; surgical evaluation of the axilla for stage M0; breast conservation for tumor stage T1 or T2; and breast reconstruction following mastectomy. Differences in receipt of evidence-based care by race/ethnicity were determined using the chi-squared test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We identified 42,474 patients with stage I-IV breast cancer. We found that a higher proportion of Black patients (3.1%) underwent excisional biopsy compared to White, Hispanic, and API patients (2.2%, 2.5%, 2.6%, respectively, (p=0.02)). There was no significant difference in the receipt of systemic chemotherapy for nodal stage N2 by patient race (p=0.09). API patients had the lowest rates of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for T4 tumors (24.7%) compared to all other races (Black 28.4%, White 29.8%, Hispanic 42.9%, p=0.007). Radiation following lumpectomy was less frequent for Black (54.9%) and Hispanic patients (60.5%) compared to White (64.9%) and API patients (67.4%, p&lt;0.001). Evaluation of the axilla (either SLNB or axillary dissection) for M0 disease was lower for Black (39.1%), Hispanic (40.6%), and API patients (44.4%) compared to White patients (48.3%, p&lt;0.001). Rates of breast conserving surgery for T1 or T2 tumors were lower among API (45.9%), Hispanic (47.6%), and Black patients (50.1%) compared to White patients (53.4%, p&lt;0.001).

Racial/ethnic minority patients receive fewer of these procedures at high volume centers, the cause for which remains undetermined. Our study aims to investigate whether disparities in access to high volume hospitals are also associated with patient income. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The 2005-2011 NIS was queried for patients with ICD-9-CM procedure/diagnostic codes for oncologic resection of the breast (BrCa), lung (LungCa), esophagus (EsophCa), stomach (GastCa) or colon (ColonCa) as well as for patients who underwent (procedure codes) CABG, AAA repair (AAAR), CEA, total hip replacement (THA), or total knee replacement (TKA). Hospitals treating patients within each operative group were dichotomized into centers that performed greater than 75<sup>th</sup> percentile (high volume centers) or less than the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile (low volume centers) of corresponding annual procedures. Median household income for patient&#39;s ZIP code was used to stratify patients into income quartile groups. Differences between the highest and lowest income quartiles were used to assess for associated differences in the risk-adjusted odds of presenting to a high-volume center for a given operation. Nationally-weighted, multivariable logistic regression accounted for differences in patient/hospital-level factors and clustering of patients within hospitals. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A combined total of 2,529,352 patients underwent included operations; most received surgery for BrCa (29.9%), TKA (21.3%) and THA (12.4%). The procedures with the highest proportion of high-income patients presenting to high-volume centers were ColonCa (90.6%), LungCa (74.7%), and BrCa (73.7%), while the procedures with the highest proportion of low-income patients presenting to high-volume centers included CABG (54.5%), AAAR (53.6%) and CEA (53.6%). Risk-adjusted analysis revealed that highest income patients were more likely to receive care at high-volume centers for THA (OR=1.96, CI:1.36-2.82), BrCa (OR=1.69, CI:1.07-2.67) and GastCa (OR=2.28, CI:1.05-4.94) but were less likely to receive care at high-volume centers for AAAR (OR=0.62, CI:0.40-0.95) when compared to lowest income patients. Differences for other procedures were not significant.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The results indicate significant differences in access to high-volume centers associated with income for certain procedures. Varied associations demonstrated might imply important differences in respective patients' ability and desire to receive care from high-volume centers, which may be dependent on the procedure type. Strengthening referral systems and re-evaluation of in-network referrals may help to increase access to high volume centers by low-income patients.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

There has been specific focus on prevention, with many trauma centers implementing violence prevention programs aimed at youth.  In these programs, patients are followed by case workers after discharge.  Outcomes have been favorable with a trend towards reduction of recurrent injury as well as crime. Although there are several programs that include victims of injury of all ages, several programs target ages 10-30 years as recidivism is more prevalent in youths.  The purpose of this study is to examine the differences between younger versus older recidivists to determine if adult recidivists may also benefit from efforts to reduce recidivism.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients ages 15-60 seen by the trauma team at a single urban trauma center for violent injuries over a six year period.  Patients were followed for recurrent injury for a minimum 3 years.  Patients that died after first violent injury were excluded. Data collection also included mechanism of injury.  Chi-square test, and T Test were used to determine differences in characteristics of recidivism between 15-25 and 25-60 age groups.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 2642 patients were included in the analysis.  This group was further subdivided into two age groups, 15-25 years (n=1300) and 26-60 years (1342).  Overall recidivism rate was 11%.  In the youth group, recidivism rate was 14% versus 9% in adults (p&lt;0.001).  Amongst the youth group, injuries inflicted by gunshot wounds, stab wounds and blunt assault comprised of 35%, 36%, and 29% of injuries respectively.  In the adult group, this was 28%, 34%, and 38% respectively.  There were no statistically significant differences between mechanisms of injury between the youth and adult groups.  There was no significant difference in mean time to recurrence which was 66 months in youths and 62 months in adults (p=0.8).  Mean abbreivated injury severity score was 4.8 in youths and 6.1 in adults and was not statistically significant.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Violent injury prevention programs have focused on at risk youth as typically recidivism is significantly more prominent in this population.  Despite a lower recidivism rate in an adult population, the prevalence is substantial.  Adults experience similar current injuries when compared to youth in a similar time frame with a similar degree of injury.   In urban trauma centers, violent injury prevention programs addressing an adult population may be beneficial in reduction of recurrent violent injury.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Studies have shown that understanding supplemental educational material contributes to increased patient involvement and satisfaction. Limited functional health literacy is a potential barrier for access to these materials. Over 30% of the US population has basic to below basic literary skills which can contribute to overall health disparities, negatively impacts outcomes, and is even associated with increased mortality. As such, the National Institutes of Health and American Medical Association have recommended that patient-directed health resources should be written at a sixth-grade reading level. This study evaluates the readability of the most commonly accessed Internet resources on the subject of lung cancer.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A search for 'lung cancer' was performed using Google and Bing, and the top 10 websites were identified. Location services were disabled and sponsored sites excluded. Relevant articles (n = 109) with patient-directed content available directly from the main sites were downloaded, and their readability was assessed using 10 established methods (Coleman-Liau, Flesch-Kincaid, Flesch Reading Ease, FORCAST, Fry Graph, Gunning Fog, New Dale-Chall, New Fog Count, Raygor Estimate, and SMOG). Readability scores were also grouped by parent website and by topic for comparison.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The average reading grade level across all sites was 11.2, with a range from 8.8 (New Fog Count) to 12.2 (SMOG).  The readability of the material varied when compared by individual website, with a range from 9.2 to 15.2 (Cancer.gov 9.2, Mayoclinic.org 9.4, Cancer.org 9.6, Lung.org 10.1, Cancer.net 10.8, WebMD.com 11, Medicalnewstoday.com 12.2, Lungcancer.org 12.2, Medicinenet.com 13, Wikipedia.org 15.2). Only 10 articles (9%) were written at a 6<sup>th</sup> grade level or lower by any test and most of these were on the topics of prevention, risk factors, complications, and making treatment decisions.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The most commonly web accessed patient-directed information about lung cancer consistently exceeds the recommended sixth grade reading level. Readability varies significantly between individual websites allowing physicians to identify and recommend sites according to a patient's level of health literacy.

Shah<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Kentucky,Surgery,Lexington, KY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Appalachia is a distinct region characterized by high levels of poverty, poor access to healthcare and a high incidence of end stage organ disease. However, there is little reported regarding the availability and characteristics of potential organ donors. There is a need to understand factors that may impact consent for donation in potential donors residing in Appalachia.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All Appalachian potential donor (APD) referrals to our OPO from 2007-12 were analyzed. Death certificates for each APD were obtained. Demographics, marital status, education, registry status, cause and manner of death, decoupling, family member approached, understanding of hopelessness by family, and hospital region were collected. The US Census Report was used to obtain median county income and poverty rates. An analysis for donation consent was performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 493 APD referrals were included. 207 consented for donation (CD) and 286 did not consent for donation (DNC). Those who CD were significantly younger (38 vs. 49 years, p&lt;0.001). There were no differences in income. On univariate analysis, APD has lower CD if: age &gt;40 vs &lt;40 (32 vs 60%, p&lt;0.001), high school or less education vs college (41 vs 58%, p&lt;0.05), not registered vs on registry (38 vs 82%, p&lt;0.001), OPO vs local provider vs family mentioned donation (37 vs 41 vs 73%, p&lt;0.001), spouse/siblings/children vs parents approached for donation (35 vs 63%, p&lt;0.001), if family did not understand hopelessness (20 vs 45%, p=0.009), declaration of death and approach for consent not decoupled (22 vs 47%, p&lt;0.001), other cause of death vs trauma (36 vs 57%, p&lt;0.001), medical vs non-medical mechanism of death (34 vs 54, p&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences between race, APD gender and marital status, hospital region, miles from home, gender of family member approached, and poverty levels of APD compared to US and state poverty rates.On multivariate analysis, predictors of CD were: age &lt;18 years (OR 5.6 p&lt;0.001), age 18-39 years (OR 6.5, p&lt;0.001), college education (OR 3.3, p=0.008), graduate school (OR 4.3, p&lt;0.001), on donor registry (OR 8.3, p&lt;0.001), family mentioned donation (OR 5.6, p&lt;0.001) and decoupling declaration of death from approach for donation (OR 5.8, p&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is not surprising that poverty rates do not correlate with donation since Appalachia is generally poorer than numerous other areas. However, several observed factors can help target at-risk groups for poor consent in APD. Higher levels of education, younger age and family awareness of organ donation are independently associated with higher rates of consent. While DMV collaborations are paramount, targeting groups with poor consent rates more directly in their local communities may help increase awareness and donor registration. Additionally, OPO and local provider collaborations may maximize donation during the hospital phase of donation in non-registered APD.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Few studies have examined disparities in length-of-stay (LOS) for vascular procedures. We aim to investigate the role of race in determining LOS for patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization (LER) using a national, surgical outcomes registry.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We queried the 2012-2013 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) to identify all patients who underwent elective LER and stratified patients by approach (open versus endovascular) and race. Patients were excluded if they had any in-hospital, post-operative complications during their index admission or a 30-day mortality. Chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank Sums tests were used to determine the differences among categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The primary model outcome was total post-operative LOS. Predictors of LOS were identified with multivariate regression using a negative binomial model. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 6,843 patients who underwent lower extremity revascularization, 76.2% and 23.8% of patients underwent an open or endovascular approach, respectively.  Black patients represented 16.3% of the overall cohort, with women representing 47.5% and 34.3% of black and white patients, respectively. Black and white patients were similar with respect to BMI (27.4 vs. 27.3), ASA class distribution, and functional health. Compared to white patients, black patients were younger (65 vs. 74 years, p&lt;0.05) and had significantly higher rates of smoking, hypertension, dialysis, insulin-dependent diabetes, and steroid use (p&lt;0.05). On adjusted comparison, black patients who underwent an open LER experienced a longer post-operative LOS (4 vs. 3 days, p&lt;0.001) compared to white patients. With an endovascular approach, no significant difference in LOS existed between races (1 vs. 1 day, p&gt;0.05). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Black patients undergoing open LER have a significantly longer LOS in comparison to white patients even with no in-hospital complications. No racial disparities in LOS were observed for patients undergoing LER by endovascular approach. Further investigations will need to examine non-NSQIP elements such as psychosocial, behavioral, and educational factors that may explain disparities in open LER.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

The objective of this study is to determine if sex bias exists in human clinical surgical research, and identify areas where the greatest and least sex biases exist.  We hypothesize that males and females are not included in surgical clinical research in equal numbers, and that data are not reported or analyzed using sex as an independent variable. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All manuscripts published in Annals of Surgery, American Journal of Surgery, JAMA Surgery, Journal of Surgical Research, and Surgery in 2011 and 2012 were reviewed. Data abstracted included study type, location, number and sex of the subjects, the degree of sex matching, and inclusion of sex-based reporting, statistical analysis, and discussion of data.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 2,347 articles reviewed, 1,668 included human subjects. Of these, an additional 365 were excluded on the basis of including animals or cells, studying a sex-specific disease, or not reporting the number of subjects included. Of the remaining 1,303 manuscripts, 17 (1%) were male-only studies, 41 (3%) were female-only studies, 1,020 (78%) included males and females, and 225 (17%) did not document the sex of the subjects studied. Using a liberal 90%, 80%, and 50% criteria for matching inclusion of both sexes, of the manuscripts that included both males and females only 118 (9%), 237 (18%), and 589 (45%) of studies matched the sex of the subjects included. For manuscripts that included both sexes, only 497 (49%) studies reported the data by sex, 432 (42%) analyzed the data by sex, and 299 (29%) included a discussion of sex-based results.  Upon analysis of the different surgical specialties, a wide variation in sex-based inclusion, matching, and data reporting existed. Vascular surgery had the most male-only manuscripts (7%), breast surgery had the most female-only manuscripts (59%), surgical oncology included both sexes in the most manuscripts (91%), and breast surgery included both sexes in the least manuscripts (7%). Surgical education documented the sex of subjects in only 53% of publications, whereas thoracic surgery documented the sex of subjects in 95% of publications. Sex-based reporting of data was only performed in 28% of publications in American Journal of Surgery whereas it was performed in 45% of publications in JAMA Surgery. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our data show that sex bias exists in human surgical clinical research. Few studies included men and women equally, less than one-third performed data analysis by sex, and there was wide variation in inclusion and matching of the sexes between the specialties and the journals reviewed. Because clinical research serves as the foundation for evidence-based medicine, it is imperative that this disparity be addressed because therapies and practice derived from such studies may be specific to only one sex.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Gadepalli<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan,Pediatric Surgery,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Perforated appendicitis is a cause of major morbidity and reduction of rates can improve patient outcomes. Since appendicitis management is time-dependent, we hypothesized that distance and time traveled to initial evaluation and time to antibiotics impact perforation rates.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  After IRB approval (HUM00095746), we retrospectively reviewed medical records, including from outside institutions (OI), of pediatric appendectomy patients from 2012-2013 at University of Michigan (UM). We collected demographics, zip codes to determine travel distances, insurance, labs, radiology, path reports, times of presentation to various institutions, to antibiotics, and to admission. We excluded patients with atypical findings not consistent with appendicitis and if over 18 years old. Primary outcome was perforated (transmural defect on path) appendicitis. Logistic regression was used to determine effect of distance and travel time and time from evaluation to antibiotics, adjusting for demographics, insurance, and site of primary evaluation with p-value &lt;0.05 deemed significant. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 245 appendectomies, 14 were excluded by atypical path and age criteria. Patients were 11.4&plusmn;3.8yr, male (60.8%), Caucasian (83.6%), and privately insured (70.1%), with 63.2% complicated and 30.7% perforated. Interval appendectomies constituted 13.4% and diagnosis was missed previously in 8.7%. Median time traveled to initial evaluation was 18min(IQR14-25) with median distance of 11.5mi(6.8-17.4). Time for antibiotics from initial evaluation was a median of 5hr(IQR3.4-8.9). Approximately 43% were seen at UM first; there was no difference in gender and race but they were older and privately insured. Patients traveled a longer distance and took more time to be seen, but travel did not affect the rate of complicated or perforated appendicitis. Patients seen at OI first had higher rates of complicated, missed, or perforated appendicitis but received antibiotics later (p=0.003), regardless of age, race, or insurance status. On logistic regression, longer time from evaluation to antibiotics increased likelihood of perforation (OR1.03, p=0.03), when adjusted for age, race, insurance, and location of initial evaluation.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Distance and time traveled to initial evaluation did not increase the risk of perforation; however, the risk significantly increased with delayed antibiotic times. This study suggests that decreasing time to antibiotics during evaluation improves outcomes in pediatric appendicitis. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings and determine what led to delays in antibiotic administration.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

In the United States, the pediatric GD population has not been well characterized due to its low prevalence and lack of comprehensive follow up. The American Thyroid Association recommends anti-thyroid drugs (ATD) for primary treatment of GD in pediatric patients, but no clear recommendation exists for definitive treatment, i.e. radioactive iodine (RAI) or thyroidectomy. This study aimed to characterize demographics and predictors of treatment selection in pediatric patients with GD at a tertiary referral center.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Retrospective review was performed of all patients diagnosed with GD at age &le;18 years from 2000-2015 at a tertiary care center. Neonatal GD patients and patients whose primary follow up was not performed at our center were excluded. The effect of race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, other), insurance status (public, private, none), intolerance to ATD, presence of ophthalmopathy, age at diagnosis, and age at definitive treatment on election of definitive treatment and likelihood of remission was determined using ANOVA and logistic regression. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 103 patients (81% female) were diagnosed with GD from 2000-2015 at median age 13 (range 2-18) years. Age at diagnosis did not differ between racial/ethnic groups or by insurance status. After primary ATD treatment, 11 (10.7%) patients entered remission at median 22 (range 3-126) months; 16 (15.5%) underwent RAI at median age 11 years; 34 (33.0%) underwent total thyroidectomy at median age 12 years; 45 (43.7%) continued ATD treatment only, with 23 (51.1%) of these continuing beyond 2 years. Type of treatment elected was independent of age at diagnosis, ophthalmopathy, insurance status and race/ethnicity. The likelihood of pursuing definitive treatment increased with age (OR: 2.6, p=0.01) and intolerance to ATD (OR: 174, p=0.01); patients with an earlier age at diagnosis trended toward greater likelihood of pursuing definitive treatment (OR: 1.8, p=0.06). Likelihood of remission was independent of all tested variables.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The management of pediatric GD is heterogeneous. Age at diagnosis and type of treatment elected were not impacted by socioeconomic status. Less than 50% of patients undergo definitive therapy (RAI or surgery) in spite of the low incidence of remission with ATD therapy alone. Increasing age and intolerance to ATD therapy increase the likelihood of pursuing definitive treatment. As pediatric GD is relatively rare, a prospective multicenter trial would be ideal to determine the optimal treatment algorithm for this patient population.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Surgery is the only curative treatment of many types of cancer, therefore we developed a community outreach program to increase surgeon presence within the community. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  In partnership with a large urban university cancer center, the Agnew society surgical interest group organized two community health outreach events focused on cancer prevention, screening and treatment in the surrounding community. Volunteers included medical students, surgical residents and faculty. The event consisted of free time for networking and engagement with participants. A survey instrument was used to gauge participant beliefs about cancer topics prior to the educational portion. The main event consisted of a presentation on colon cancer, followed by survivor and caregiver testimony and a question and answer session. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey results and to compare the demographics of the university to the community participants. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Faculty are 69% male, 77% White, 3.5% African American and 14% Asian. Twenty-two surgical volunteers participated in the events and 2 of 6 faculty member panelists were African American.  A total of 265 community members attended. Participants were 20% male and 96% African American. The survey response rate was 71% (188/256). Thirty-two percent endorsed mistrust in what doctors told them, 22% found it difficult to talk to doctors, and 25% felt that surgical treatment caused cancer to spread. After the first event, all medical professionals voluntarily continued participation in the second event and committed to future participation.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There was a clear difference between the demographic profiles of the university staff and the community that they served. Negative perceptions of physicians and the role of surgery in cancer treatment were prevalent within the community. Surgeon interest in community outreach is largely underappreciated. Surgeon engagement in community outreach can be easily expanded to other urban centers and may provide an opportunity to reduce surgical disparities.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

The aim of the current study was to identify person and population level disparities in sociodemographic and health characteristics between patients with localized gastrointestinal malignancies treated with and without curative resection. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey linked database (SEER-MHOS), we identified patients diagnosed with localized adenocarcinoma of esophagus, stomach, small bowel, colon, and rectum who completed a comprehensive physical and mental health outcomes survey within two years of their diagnosis. Overall survival was summarized using Kaplan Meier methods; the log rank test was used to test for survival differences by receipt of surgery. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to identify disparities in sociodemographic and health characteristics between patients who were or were not treated with curative resection. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:2,051 eligible patients were included in the study cohort. 20.3% of patients did not undergo surgery expected for treatment of a localized gastrointestinal cancer. Overall survival was improved for those treated with surgery (HR 0.63, 0.55-0.74 95% CI, p&lt;0.001). Univariate analysis of sociodemographic and health characteristics showed that surgical intervention was less likely in male patients, non-homeowners, lower median household income, older age, more than two comorbid conditions, any impairment in activities of daily living, lower physical quality of life, prior history of cancer, and larger tumor size (all p&lt;0.05). Person-level social characteristics including non-white race, less than high school education, and marriage status were not predictors of undergoing surgery. In addition, population-level social characteristics including non-metropolitan residence, non-white neighborhood, lower income neighborhood, and neighborhood with lower level of education, were not predictors of undergoing surgery. In a multivariate model using both person and population-level social characteristics, factors independently associated with curative resection were female gender, younger age, fewer comorbidities, and no prior history of cancer (all p&lt;0.05). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In the United States, patients diagnosed with early stage GI malignancies were less likely to proceed with curative resection secondary to person-level health characteristics.

We examined this hypothesis comparing findings among patients treated at military hospitals and those treated at civilian facilities.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using Tricare data, which include uniformed service personnel, dependents and retirees, we identified patients aged 18-65 years without Medicare coverage who underwent their first reported CABG (ICD-9CM 36.10 -36.20) between 2006-2010. Patients with concurrent valve surgeries or who had length of stay &lt; 1 day or &gt;30 days were excluded. Patient demographics were compared between Black and White patients using standard descriptive methods, stratified by gender. Linear regression models examined Black vs. White differences in patient LOS, controlling for patient and hospital-level factors. Analyses were conducted among patients treated in military facilities and, separately, among patients receiving care in civilian hospitals.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the 3247 CABG patients, 2884 (89%) were White, of whom 9.9% were female. Among Black patients, 78 (21.5%) were female. Most patients were retirees or their dependants (86.8%). 30% of White and 33% of Black patients underwent emergent CABG (p=0.23). In gender stratified adjusted analyses, Black males experienced greater LOS vs. White male patients (7.8 vs. 7.2 days respectively, p=0.02); however, there was no difference in LOS between Black vs. White females (p=0.12). On subset analysis, race-based difference in LOS among males was observed only in civilian hospitals (8.2 vs. 7.3 days, p=0.004); there was no difference in LOS between Black and White male patients treated in military hospitals (p=0.37). Among female patients, LOS did not differ by race between military and civilian hospitals. Older age and emergent CABG were associated with longer stay for both male and female patients across both races and facility types.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In this cohort of younger adult CABG patients insured through military affiliation, Black race was associated with greater LOS among male, but not female, patients. This race-based variability in LOS was associated with care in civilian facilities. Factors underlying this race-based difference in LOS, present only in civilian hospitals, should be elucidated.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Carrigan<sup>1</sup>, J. Tchou<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Pennsylvania,Department Of Surgery,Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Prompt and appropriate surgical management following diagnosis significantly impacts long-term survival in breast cancer patients. However, access to care can often be delayed. Some studies have observed that there are racial discrepancies in the length of time between initial cancer diagnosis and definitive cancer surgery, and race has been repeatedly shown to be an independent predictor of survival. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  To test the hypothesis that the length of time between breast cancer diagnosis and definitive surgery is associated with race, we performed a retrospective chart review of a pilot breast cancer patient cohort (n=424) who have received their surgical care at a single institution between 1995 and 2015 to establish feasibility. Women were stratified into the following categories based on self-reported race: Asian (16), Black (112), White (283), and Other (9). The interval from cancer diagnosis to definitive cancer surgery was defined as the number of days from the date of the patient's initial positive core biopsy or surgical biopsy to the date of definitive surgical intervention (i.e., lumpectomy or mastectomy). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The average diagnosis to surgery time was the longest for African Americans (65.29 days, median = 42) and significantly shorter for White women (49.76 days, median = 34) (two-sided t-test p &lt;0.008). Asians (48.56 days, median = 35.5) and patients of other ethnicities (52.33 days, median =39.92) had comparable diagnosis to surgery times as compared to White women, though their cohort sizes were small and precluded statistical analysis.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our findings are consistent with other studies showing that there is a prolonged diagnosis to surgery time for women of African American descent. It is not clear whether this is due to delays in seeking care after diagnosis or if there are delays in scheduling surgery. Socioeconomic and cultural differences as well as disparities in health literacy and education may all contribute to these differences. Further analysis is planned to expand our pilot cohort to include more than 3,000 patients consecutively treated at our institution during this study period to evaluate the impact of other covariates, which are not commonly available in national databases but are readily available from our electronic medical record, on the relationship between race, prolonged definitive surgery time interval and clinical outcomes (i.e., age, socioeconomic status, insurance, and comorbidities such as body mass index). Our goal is to address whether a delay in receiving definitive surgery following diagnosis significantly impacts overall or cancer-specific survival, as narrowing this time window may be a targetable measure for breast cancer care providers in reducing existing racial disparities in cancer care outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

All patients older than 65 years who underwent elective colon resection for cancer were included. Mixed effects logistic regression was performed to determine the impact of patient demographics, comorbidities as well as post-operative complications on inpatient mortality. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:12,945 patients &ge;65 underwent colon resection during our study period. Patients were divided into three age groups: 65-79 (n=8411), 80-89 (n=4038), &ge;90 (n=496). The average age for each group was 72.1, 83.7, and 91.2 years. Patients &ge;90 had more comorbidities than the youngest cohort: anemia (47.2% vs. 28.9%, p&lt;0.001), congestive heart failure (15.5% vs. 5.4%, p&lt;0.001), chronic renal failure (12.5% vs. 6.7%, p&lt;0.001), and malnutrition (9.7% vs. 3.8%, p&lt;0.001). The youngest group had a higher incidence of chronic lung disease (18.6% vs. 15.7%, p&lt;0.001). The average length of stay for each group was 6.9, 7.9, and 8.1 days (p&lt;0.001). Post-operatively, the oldest patients were more likely to experience pulmonary failure (7.1%, p&lt;0.001), MI (1.6%, p&lt;0.001), acute renal failure (7.1%, p&lt;0.001), and pneumonia (4.0%, p&lt;0.001) compared to those aged 65-79 and 80-89. Mortality was 1.0%, 2.5%, and 3.6% in each group respectively (p&lt;0.001). We examined the impact of the above characteristics on the odds of mortality following surgery for each age group using multivariable modeling. A representative sample of the most significant patient-level determinants is reported in Table 1.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:We have demonstrated significant variability of patient-related factors affecting mortality between age groups within the geriatric population. Respiratory failure in the immediate post-operative period is a significant predictor for mortality in all age groups. Post-operative ARF was associated with increased mortality in the two younger age groups while post-operative MI was only significant in those patients ages 65-79.  These findings can be used to develop a more sophisticated prediction tool that will impact clinical decision-making and may improve outcomes for older patients undergoing elective colon cancer surgery.","Outcomes/Clinical","Geriatric Surgery","Cross Disciplinary"

Likewise, elective/semi-elective cholecystectomy (EL) carries a lower complication rate than emergency cholecystectomy (EM).  When assessing risk across age groups, there is limited data regarding complication and mortality risk for older patients.  We hypothesize that while there will be an expected difference in older patients, the difference will be greater for emergency operations in older patients, and especially so for those undergoing open cholecystectomy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Prospective data were obtained from a state-wide Surgical Quality Collaborative (SQC) database with a random sample of 20-30% of all surgeries performed 1/1/2005-12/31/2010. Patient characteristics, preoperative comorbidities, complication and mortality rates were compared for emergent and elective cases.  Patient outcomes were stratified according to age groups: (1) age &lt;45years; (2) age 45-64 years; (3) age 65-79 years; and (4) age &gt;80 years<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Over the 5-year time period, 18106 cholecystectomies were logged into the SQC database.  A total of 1409 cases were classified as emergency operations, of which 1080 were completed laparoscopically and 329 were completed open.   A total of 16697 patients in the database underwent elective operations, of which 15185 were laparoscopic and 1512 were open.  Overall, 71.5% of patients were female, with a mean age of 49.9 years.  Overall morbidity was 2.2% for elective LC, 14.6% for elective OC, 3.7%  for emergent LC and and 24% for emergent OC cases.   Patient data as stratified by age groups are listed in Table 1.   The difference in outcome between age groups 3&amp;4 in the emergent setting is much greater than the difference between the same age groups in the elective setting (P&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Patient who are &gt;80 years of age have significant risk for morbidity and mortality in both elective and emergency cholecystectomies.   This increase in risk overall, the difference is much higher in the emergent population, regardless of surgical approach.

Thus far much work has focused on improving access to care.  The study of surgical quality, however, remains a nascent field, especially in low- and middle-income countries. We systematically evaluate the literature assessing surgical quality in LMIC and discuss possible areas for further investigation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a search of the English language literature published after January 1, 2000 using Medline and Embase. MeSH, Emtree, and individual word searches were used to capture three domains: quality of care, surgical procedure, and low- and middle-income country. We included studies evaluating surgeries that comprise the DCP-3 Essential Surgery Package for first level hospitals, excluding studies of thoracostomy, colposcopy, and vacuum extraction/forceps delivery. Furthermore, we excluded any study where all patients did not undergo surgical intervention. The data extracted included: sample size, study design, type of surgery performed, and whether processes or outcomes were evaluated. We further determined whether authors evaluated checklist utilization, mortality, morbidity, or health-related quality of life (HRQL). Our search and extraction followed PRISMA guidelines.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Our search identified a total of 4885 articles; 301 studies remained for data extraction after title and abstract screening. The mean sample size of the studies was 1841 patients (SD 9359.7) with a median of 104 patients. 78.2% of studies were observational, of which 55.6% were retrospective. 28.9% of studies evaluated multiple surgical procedures. Studies of operative fracture reduction (11.9%), hernia surgery (11.2%), Cesarean sections (11.2%), and laparotomy for perforated viscus (10.9%) were the most common of the DCP-3 procedures evaluated. There were no studies evaluating quality for patients specifically undergoing escharotomy/fasciotomy and only one study each for dilation &amp; curettage, skin graft, vasectomy, and debridement of osteomyelitis. We found process-based measures reported in 10.3% of studies; 99% of studies reported outcomes-based measures. Amongst studies reporting processes, 22.6% were of checklists. Amongst studies reporting outcomes, mortality was reported in 47.2%, morbidity in 88.0% and HRQL in 16.3%.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:As LMICs expand access to surgical care, there must be a directed effort to monitor the care delivered. Studies of surgical quality vary greatly in size, but many are small. The vast majority of these studies are observational in design. Further, HRQL and process-based measures are frequently overlooked dimensions of quality, while numerous essential surgeries are underrepresented in the literature. Future studies should expand on these parameters to close gaps in the literature.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

The aim of our study was to evaluate the trends and discover its effects on management and whether an aging population is spared from operations.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  158,251 cases from HCUP-NIS discharge data (2007-2011) were collected with primary admission of complicated (abscess, ICD-9 569.5 or perforated 569.83) diverticulitis (ICD-9 562.11 or 562.13). Patients were assessed for percutaneous drainage (ICD9 54.91).  Intervention groups were non-operative, non-operative with percutaneous drainage or operative (all other surgeries).  Age of patients was evaluated by two groups (younger 18-59 and older 60+). Exclusion criteria were: &lt; 18 years of age, malignancy, and inflammatory bowel disease. Descriptive, x2, and test of proportion statistics were used to evaluate incidence rate of admission, and demographic changes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Complicated diverticulitis hospitalizations have increased from 19 to 21.5% from 2007 to 2011 (p&lt;.001). The majority of patients were younger (55.5%), however the highest rate increase was in older patients with complicated diverticulitis (2.8%, p&lt;.001).

However the elderly are presenting with an increasing rate of complicated diverticulitis requiring operative intervention.  It is possible the nonoperative management in the younger population is increasing the need for future hospitalizations and operative management as they age.  Further studies could aim at determining long-term outcomes of elective colectomies after effective nonoperative management in the younger population and if this reduces emergent operations in the elderly.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Lee, IV<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania,Department Of Surgery,Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:   Readmission rates have been highlighted as a target for cost-control in healthcare. Pancreatectomy is associated with high readmission rates, and multiple studies have identified factors associated with 30-day readmission. This study sought to delineate differences in patients readmitted early after discharge versus those readmitted remotely. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Patients who underwent open pancreatectomy were identified in the 2008-2010 California State Inpatient Database. Patients were stratified according to whether they were first readmitted at days 0-30 post-discharge (early), 31-90 (intermediate), 91-365 (late), or had no readmissions within the first year.  Descriptive statistics were used to characterize each readmission group. Multinominal logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for readmission by timeframe. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  3,118 patients underwent pancreatectomy. 1,507 (48%) patients were readmitted in the year following discharge (21.6% early, 8.9% intermediate, 17.9% late). The median time to first readmission was 43 days (IQR 9 - 165). The median number of readmissions within the first year for readmitted patients was 2 (IQR 1-3). Demographically, age (p &lt; 0.0001), insurance status (p = 0.0001), diagnosis (p &lt; 0.0001), and malignancy (p &lt; 0.0001) were the most significant predictors of readmission. A similar percentage of patients with malignant and benign disease were first readmitted within 30 days (21.5% and 22.0%, respectively). However, 20.7% of patients with malignancy versus only 8.8% of patients with benign disease were first readmitted at day 91-365. Comorbidities that had the most significant associations with readmissions were hypertension, CHF, metastatic disease (including lymph nodes), renal failure, and weight loss (p &lt; 0.0001 for all). The complication that was most strongly associated with readmission was postoperative shock (OR 26.7 [95% CI 5.2 &ndash; 489] early, OR 11.8 [95% CI 1.1 &ndash; 253] intermediate, OR 11.6 [95% CI 1.7 &ndash; 228] late). Factors not significantly associated with readmission included obesity (p = 0.496), race (p = 0.055), income (p = 0.549), wound complications (p = 0.244), and GI complications (p = 0.524). Complications related to surgical/medical care were the primary reason for 39.9% of early readmissions but only 15.9% of intermediate and 6.1% of late readmissions. However, the primary procedure performed on readmission was similar in all groups. Either an abdominal drainage procedure or an upper endoscopy was the primary procedure in 22.3% of early readmissions, 17.9% of intermediate readmissions, and 14.2% of late readmissions. <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:  Reducing readmissions after pancreatectomy remains challenging. Time to first readmission after pancreatectomy can vary widely, and 30-day readmission rates can therefore underestimate the extent of the problem. Reasons for readmission vary with time, but invasive interventions are often necessary at any time point.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Cholecystectomy remains the mainstay of treatment for acute cholecystitis. Little is known about the risk of obesity on outcomes following cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of obesity on the outcomes of cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who underwent a cholecystectomy (laparoscopic, open, or converted) for acute cholecystitis from 2007-2013 were identified from the American College of Surgeons NSQIP database. Patients were classified into normal (BMI &lt; 30) and obese (BMI &ge; 30) groups. Obese patients were subcategorized into the following groups: 30 &le; BMI &lt; 40, 40 &le; BMI &lt; 50, and 50 &le; BMI. The outcomes of interest were operative time, mortality, morbidity, and post-operative length of stay. Independent multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to examine the association between obesity and each of the outcomes of interest. A procedure was considered converted if there was a primary CPT code for a laparoscopic procedure and a secondary CPT code for an open procedure.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 22, 808 patients included in the study, 46% were obese. After adjustment for potential confounders, obesity (BMI &ge; 30) was found to be significantly associated with prolonged operative time (defined as a procedure-specific operative time in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile or above) (OR = 1.43, p &lt; 0.0001) relative to normal BMI. Obesity was not significantly associated with overall morbidity, mortality, or post-operative length of stay. Subgroup analysis revealed that each obese subgroup was significantly associated with a prolonged operative time, relative to the normal BMI group. The subgroup with a BMI between 40 and 49.9 had a significantly higher mortality rate relative to the normal BMI group (OR 3.16, p = 0.003), and the subgroup with a BMI between 30 and 39.9 had significantly more thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism or DVT) relative to the normal BMI group (OR 1.86, p = 0.02). Among open cholecystectomies, obesity was significantly associated with prolonged operative time and increased mortality compared to a normal BMI. Among laparoscopic cholecystectomies, obesity was significantly associated with prolonged operative time but not increased mortality, relative to normal BMI. The percent of patients who received laparoscopic vs. open cholecystectomies did not vary with BMI.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The data suggest that cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is safe even in high BMI patients, and that the operation can usually be completed laparoscopically.

Our goal was to explore physicians' clinical decision making in older patients.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Semi-structured interviews with 10 clinical vignettes were conducted with 9 primary care physicians (PCP), 7 gastroenterologists, and 6 surgeons. In the vignettes patients were &gt;65 years; the severity of their gallbladder disease and associated comorbidities varied. Using a previously validated PREOP-Gallstones risk prediction model, predicted rates of gallstone-related hospitalization were calculated for each vignette. For each vignette, physicians were asked: 1) To estimate the patient's 2-year risk of developing gallstone-related complications, and 2) If they would recommend or refer the patient for cholecystectomy. Model-predicted rates were compared to physician-predicted rates.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The results from 5 vignettes are summarized in Table 1. Across specialties, physician-predicted risk of 2-year acute gallstone-related hospitalization was inconsistent with model-predicted risk. Physician-predicted risk generally increased with increased gallstone disease severity but both the direction and magnitude of the inconsistency varied with the clinical scenario and physician specialty. On average, surgeons were more likely to recommend cholecystectomy. In many cases surgeons behaved paradoxically, recommending cholecystectomy less often for patients at higher risk; they recommended cholecystectomy in 83% of patients with biliary colic (predicted a 21% 2-year risk of complications) and only 67% of patients with gallstone pancreatitis and comorbidities (predicted a 61% risk). Among PCPs and gastroenterologists, referral for cholecystectomy generally increased with perceived risk, but even when they predicted a high risk they did not uniformly refer for surgical evaluation. In most cases where surgeon recommended cholecystectomy rates were high, PCPs and gastroenterologists did not recommend referral.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Across specialties, physicians were inaccurate at predicting risk as compared to a recently validated risk-prediction model. Patients perceived to be at the highest risk are not routinely referred for surgical evaluation. Moreover, there appears to be a disconnect, with non-surgeons frequently not referring patients in whom surgeons would recommend cholecystectomy. Physician education and incorporation of risk prediction models into clinical practice can better align treatment with risk and improve outcomes in older patients with symptomatic gallstones.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

However, benefits of utilizing a robotic approach compared to the standard laparoscopic approach have not been well defined, especially in resections not involving pelvic anastomoses.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who underwent either a robotic or laparoscopic colectomy from the 2012-2013 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database were selected. Short-term perioperative outcomes were compared between 1:1 propensity-matched groups. A subset analysis was performed among patients who underwent segmental resections only.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among the 15,976 patients included, 498 (3.1%) colectomies were performed robotically. After matching for demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics, there were no differences between robotic and laparoscopic resections with regard to wound complications or other complications such as urinary tract infection, cardiopulmonary or thromboembolic events, renal insufficiency, anastomotic leaks, transfusion requirements, unplanned readmissions, or 30-day mortality (all p &gt;0.05). However, operative time was significantly higher for the robotic colectomies (196 vs. 166 minutes, p &lt;0.001). Among segmental resections only, operative time was still significantly longer for robotic colectomies  (190 vs. 153 minutes, p &lt;0.001) without differences in postoperative outcomes (all p &gt;0.05).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this early population-based experience, robotic colectomies appear to result in similar perioperative outcomes when compared to laparoscopic colectomies, but are associated with longer operative times. Given the current focus on value-based healthcare, utilizing robotic technologies in straightforward resections may not justify the cost.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

The parathyroid glands are 5mm or less in size, often intracapsular or intrathyroidal and obscured by central compartment lymph nodes, making preservation a challenge. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of inadvertent parathyroidectomy (IP) during thyroidectomy, its risk factors and whether it contributes to the development of hypoparathyroidism.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of all thyroid operations performed by a single surgeon from January 1, 2010 through July 31, 2014 were reviewed to determine the rate of IP and permanent hypoparathyroidism. Patient medical records were assessed for demographics, extent of thyroidectomy, central compartment lymph node dissection, thyroid gland weight, retrosternal goiter, parathyroid autotransplantation, reoperation, pathology, postoperative calcium levels and number of parathyroid glands inadvertently removed. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Three hundred eighty-six patients underwent thyroidectomy, including 243 total and 17 completion thyroidectomies and 126 lobectomies. Mean age was 51.8 &plusmn; 14.1 years and 327 (85%) patients were female. There were 25 (6%) reoperations, 40 (10%) patients had central compartment lymph node dissection and 128 (33%) underwent parathyroid gland autotransplantation. IP occurred in 78 (20%) patients, 16 of whom had intrathyroidal glands. Permanent hypoparathyroidism occurred in 7 (2.7%) of 260 patients following total or completion thyroidectomy, 4 (5%) with IP compared to 3 (1%) without IP (p = 0.033). Logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender (odds ratio = 2.768, p = 0.040), central compartment lymph node dissection (odds ratio = 9.584, p = 0.001), and thyroid gland weight (odds ratio = 0.994, p = 0.022) were independent factors associated with IP. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:IP, which occurred in 20% of patients undergoing thyroidectomy, is a remediable factor that was associated with a higher rate of hypoparathyroidism.

Hernia surgery is among the most common surgical procedures performed by general surgeons estimated to be 750,000 operations yearly. Our objective was to analyze malpractice litigation related to hernia surgery and discuss ways to prevent future litigation for physicians.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using Westlaw Next (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY), a comprehensive law database with publically available records collected from many jurisdictions, we searched all jury verdicts and settlements for the terms:  'medical malpractice', 'hernia' and, 'herniorrhaphy.' Dates of cases ranged from 1985 to 2015. Exclusion criteria included cases where hernia surgery was not the primary reason for litigation. Information was collected from all cases on patient demographics, physician speciality, procedural characteristics, alleged reason for malpractice claim and outcome of the trial. Data is presented as means &plusmn; standard deviation with a p value of &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The search criteria yielded 568 case briefs; 260 cases met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Sixty-five percent (170) of the patients involved in cases were male; mean patient age was 50 &plusmn; 15. The two most common hernia procedures which led to litigation were inguinal and ventral hernia repairs (&gt;90%). The state of New York had the highest number of medical malpractice cases (47) followed closely by California (46). In 38 cases (15%) the patient claimed informed consent was breeched by the surgeon. The most common alleged reason for litigation was damage to surrounding structures. Overall 59% (152) of cases were decided in favor of the defendant (physician). Median jury verdict and settlement sum was $700,000.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Surgical complications and patient death played a significant role in outcomes of malpractice litigation. Although a majority of the cases were decided in the favor of the defendant,  jury verdicts and settlements decided in favor of the plaintiff were costly.  By understanding the reasons why surgeons go to trial; the risk of future lawsuits may lessen if proper measures are taken to prevent such outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

The aim of this prospective study is to determine the outcomes of patients undergoing initial non-operative treatment of their ventral hernia.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A prospective, longitudinal study of patients undergoing non-operative management of their ventral hernia at a safety-net hospital was initiated in 2014. Non-operative management was elected either by the surgeon based upon poor predicted risk-benefit ratio or by the patient.  Primary outcome was rate of surgical repair of the ventral hernias. Secondary outcomes included rate of emergency repair, elective repair, and emergency room visits.  Validated surveys for patient satisfaction, cosmetic satisfaction, abdominal pain, and patient function (modified Activities Assessment Scale, AAS) were utilized.  Baseline and 6-month follow up surveys were compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test with p&lt;0.05 considered significant. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Of 114 patients who underwent non-operative management of their ventral hernia, 85 (74.6%) were followed for a median (interquartile range) of 7.8 (5.6-9.0) months.  Reasons for non-operative management were obesity (81, 71.1%), smoking (22, 19.2%), other co-morbidities (23, 20.2%), patient choice (10, 8.8%), and surgical complexity (3, 2.6%).  Six (7.1%) patients underwent ventral hernia repair following enrollment: 4 (4.7%) were repaired electively and 2 (2.4%) were repaired emergently.  Among those undergoing elective repair, 3 patients met their goals required for elective surgery (weight loss and/or smoking cessation) and one underwent surgery at another institution.  Ten (11.8%) patients had at least 1 emergency room visit associated with their hernia.   Based on the modified AAS survey, patients who were managed non-operatively had increased feelings of sadness because of their hernia during the time they were followed (p=0.045) and worsening overall functional status (p=0.049). Patients who were converted to operative management had improved satisfaction with their abdominal wall (p=0.027), satisfaction with the appearance of their abdominal wall (p=0.027), and improvement in how much their abdominal wall affected them at work (p=0.034).  There were no differences in abdominal wall pain (table). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Patients who undergo non-operative management of their ventral hernias experience significant declines in patient-reported outcomes.  While the short-term risk of emergency surgery among patients with ventral hernias managed non-operatively is low, the long-term risk is unknown.  Patients with ventral hernias should be optimized so that they can undergo elective repair.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Patients who underwent surgery for gallbladder disease without cholecystitis or had acute renal failure were excluded. Outcomes of interest were mortality, common bile duct injury, conversion to open, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications (mechanical, respiratory, digestive system, cardiovascular, nervous system, postoperative infections), length of stay (LOS), and total charge. Univariate analysis was performed using t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. Multivariable models were created that adjusted for age, gender, race, type of insurance, income demographics, year of admission, elective status, number of Elixhauser comorbidities, and presence of end stage renal disease (ESRD).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 512,073 patients that underwent LC, 5,020 had ESRD. On univariate analysis, the ESRD cohort had a higher incidence of mortality (3.8% vs 0.37%, p &lt;0.0001) and complications: intraoperative (3.0% vs 1.4%, p&lt;0.0001), mechanical wound (1.7% vs 0.4%, p &lt;0.0001), respiratory (3.8% vs 1.8%, p&lt;0.0001), cardiovascular (1.6% vs 0.7%, p&lt;0.0001), nervous system (0.1% vs 0.04%, p=0.0426), and postoperative infections (8.4% vs 5.3%, p&lt;0.0001). ESRD patients had higher median LOS (7.0 days vs 3.0 days, p&lt;0.0001) and total charge ($55,920 vs $27,371, p&lt;0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed ESRD as an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 3.94, 95% CI 3.30-4.69, p&lt;0.0001), mechanical wound complications (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.48-2.45, p&lt;0.0001), and intraoperative complications (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.21-1.76, p&lt;0.0001). Patients with ESRD were found to have decreased risk for postoperative infections (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.94, p=0.0023). Negative binomial regression analysis showed that ESRD patients had LOS 50.4% longer than non-ESRD patients (95% CI 47.5%-53.3%, p&lt;0.0001). Linear regression analysis showed that, after adjustment, ESRD patients had total charge 6.82% higher than non-ESRD patients (95% CI 5.02%-8.66%, p&lt;0.0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this large retrospective analysis, we find that after adjusting for clinical, socioeconomic, and demographic variables, ESRD is an independent risk factor for increased mortality, intraoperative complications, mechanical wound complications, increased LOS and cost for patients undergoing LC.

Identification of this mutation is clinically important as we now have FDA-approved targeted therapies, such as BRAF and MEK inhibitors, which have shown to retard the disease progression in these patients. Detection of BRAF-V600E by genetic analysis using PCR is the gold standard method for melanoma cases. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) using VE1 antibody is rapidly immerging as a trustworthy method for determination of mutation status in patients' specimens.<br><br><strong>Objective</strong>: To assess the reliability of IHC compared to genetic methods for successful identification of BRAF-V600E mutation in melanoma tissue specimens.Study <br><br><strong>Design</strong>: Systematic review and meta-analysis of English language studies comparing IHC with genetic analysis for the detection of BRAF-V600E mutation in melanoma patients was performed.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase was performed for studies comparing IHC to genetic analysis for the detection of BRAF in melanoma patients published through May 28, 2015. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated using a bivariate model. Logit estimates of sensitivity and specificity with their respective variances were used to plot a hierarchical ROC curve and area under the curve. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q and I-squared statistics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Initial literature search resulted in 287 articles. After two independent reviews and consensus-based discussion to resolve disparities; 21 studies involving a total of 1,753 cases met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The pooled sensitivity of IHC was 0.97; 95% CI (0.94-0.98), specificity 0.99; 95% CI (0.97-1.00), positive likelihood ratio 158.3; 95% CI (33.8-740.8), negative likelihood ratio 0.03; 95% CI (0.02-0.06), and diagnostic odds ratio 4672 (1104-19780). A high heterogeneity was observed between these studies (Q value of 28.77 &amp; I<sup>2</sup> value of 93; 95% CI (87-99) which may be explained by studies using different cutoff values for interpretation of IHC. High accuracy of IHC was depicted by AUC in the ROC curve which was 0.99; 95 % CI (0.98-1.00).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Meta-analysis demonstrates that IHC is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of BRAF-V600E in melanoma cases. IHC is likely to be useful method in BRAF mutation detection because it is highly comparable to the genetic methods. Any negative or low staining cases may be selected to undergo genetic analysis based on other clinical and histopathological features.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Gastroenterologists and surgeons were identified by procedural profiles and unique physician identifiers.  Comorbidity was assessed via Charlson Score.  Outcomes including cost, length of stay (LOS), and mortality were analyzed, with and without propensity score matching (PSM).  Comparison for statistical significance was accomplished via t-test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 198,661 ERCP's were identified, of which 158,318 (79.7%) were performed by surgeons.   Surgeons exhibited longer LOS (8.7 vs. 7.2 days), overall cost ($24,739 vs. $16,960), and mortality (3.9% vs. 1.2%, odds ratio 3.3), with p&lt;0.001 for all measures. 71.6% of surgical patients, vs. 19.6% of gastroenterologic, underwent subsequent inpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomy or laparotomy.  Outcome differences persisted when PSM included performance of subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Evaluation of minimum performance standards revealed up to 5-fold increased mortality for providers who performed less than 5 ERCP's/year, irrespective of specialty background. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Gastroenterologists demonstrate favorable gross outcomes compared to surgeons performing ERCP.  Differences may correlate in part with more frequent subsequent surgical management of comorbid conditions by surgical providers.

Chart review was performed to collect data on intra-operative fluid type and volume as well as fluid volume data for postoperative day one. The primary outcome was postoperative ileus, defined as presence of a nasogastric tube for nausea or vomiting or NPO status on postoperative day four or later. Volumes of crystalloid (0.9% saline and Ringer's lactate) were divided into quartiles and volumes of colloid (5% albumin, hydroxyethyl starch, and blood products) were divided based on whether or not colloid was administered intraoperatively. Association with POI was assessed using Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression. Covariates were chosen from comorbidities, demographics, and operation specifics based on relevance to hypothesis and relative significance on univariate analysis. Secondly, we compared the ratio of the rates of fluid administration for the intraoperative period and the period through postoperative day 1.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 300 patients were included in our study, with an overall POI incidence of 30.0% (90 out of 300). On univariate analysis, we found that increasing intraoperative crystalloid administration was associated with increasing rates of POI (1<sup>st </sup>quartile: 16.3%; 2<sup>nd</sup> quartile: 31.5%; 3<sup>rd </sup>quartile: 34.2%; 4<sup>th</sup> quartile: 39.2%; P = 0.012). Total intra-operative colloid administration showed no association with development of POI (P = 0.065). Multivariate analysis confirmed a relationship between intra-operative crystalloid volume and risk of POI. Results are shown in table 1. Other significant predictors of POI included older age, and operative approach. Finally, we found no correlation between the incidence of POI and the ratio of fluid administration rates in the intraoperative and postoperative phases of care.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In patients undergoing colorectal surgery, lower intraoperative crystalloid administration was associated with lower rates of POI, while colloid did not appear to affect ileus rate.

Honoraria, speakers' fees, consulting/advisory fees, gifts and other non-ownership payments can significantly introduce a conflict of interest in healthcare. We hypothesized that there exists significant variation between the surgical subspecialties in the non-research payments from industry likely due to significant difference in adoption of modern technology between them.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires the health care industry to report payments made to physicians to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). This information is recorded in the Open Payments database (OPD) beginning with payments made on August 1, 2013.  The OPD was reviewed to identify non-research payments made to physicians in surgical subspecialties between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. Data on payments made to individual physicians and the number of surgeons receiving payments were compared across different surgical subspecialties. Focus group methodology was used to ascertain hierarchical ordering of adoption of technology amongst surgical subspecialties.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In 2013, there were 131,819 general transactions from industry to 22,167 surgeons. Subspecialty classifications included General (and Trauma) Surgery (64.7%), Colorectal Surgery (4.3%), Critical Care Surgery (1.5%), Surgical Oncology (2%), Trauma only (1.3%), Vascular Surgery (11.2%), Thoracic (13%) and Transplant Surgery (1.1%). Median payment per transaction was $27 (IQR $14.4-$104.8) while the mean payment per transaction was $274 (&plusmn; $7181.5). The mean number of payments per surgeon was 5.9.

Few studies have examined the association between the presence of sarcopenia and outcomes following pancreatic surgery. These studies had traditionally defined sarcopenia measuring total psoas area (TPA) or volume (TPV). However, the entire skeletal muscle area (SMA) to the midpoint of L3 vertebral body is considered a  more objective measure of sarcopenia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of sarcopenia and to investigate its impact on long-term outcomes in patients who underwent pancreatectomy for tumor.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  One hundred and six patients who underwent pancreatectomy for malignancy between 2003 and 2014 met the inclusion criteria.

Sarcopenia was significantly related to histology (p=0.031), body mass index (p&lt;0.001), lower value of albumin (p=0.002), modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS, p=0.036) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI, p=0.003). Overall morbidity was 41.8% and 90-days mortality was 6.8%. Overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter in sarcopenic patients than in non-sarcopenic patients (3-year OS 60.3vs 35.6% and 5-year 47.5 vs 20.7%, log-rank p=0.008). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, sarcopenia remained independently associated with poor overall survival (HR 2.178; 95% CI 1.11-4.273; p=0.024).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Sarcopenia, as assessed by L3 SMI, was found in 66.4% of patients underwent pancreatectomy. It was correlated to worse nutritional status and could be a more objective measure of patient frailty even in overweight/obese patients. This condition independently impacts survival and may be a useful preoperative tool for clinical decision-making in patients undergoing curative pancreatic resection.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Kelz<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania,Surgery,Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is often associated with higher costs than open operations due to expensive equipment. Institutions that perform higher volumes of an operation are associated with improved clinical outcomes, such as shorter lengths of stay and fewer postoperative complications, over low-volume institutions, and these improved outcomes may translate into lower associated costs. We sought to examine if economies of scale existed in the provision of MIS surgery. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A unique inpatient database using discharge data from three high-volume surgical states (California, Florida and New York) over a five-year period was used. Four common general surgery operation groups, for which the MIS approach offers improved or equivalent outcomes to the open technique, were selected: cholecystectomy, appendectomy, bariatric, and antireflux. For each operation, the per-hospital number of MIS operations and the associated wage-adjusted cost was obtained. Hospitals were categorized as low-volume (lowest 20%), moderate, and high volume (highest 20%) for each of the five MIS operations. The median associated wage-adjusted cost was compared between low, moderate and high-volume categories for each operation using the Kruskal-Wallis. The Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: For cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and antireflux procedures, low-volume institutions had a significantly higher median cost than moderate- and high-volume institutions. For cholecystectomy and appendectomy, high-volume institutions had the lowest median cost. For antireflux operations, moderate-volume institutions had the lowest median cost, although the difference may not be clinically significant. For bariatric procedures, cost increased with volume. See Table 1.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Economies of scale exist between low- vs. moderate- and high-volume institutions for all operations studied except bariatric. The highest-volume institutions did not always have the lowest associated costs. Costs associated with bariatric operations increased with volume, which may be related to restrictions on where high-risk patients receive bariatric surgery.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

There is need for simple validated risk models to better identify 30-day mortality.  The goal of this study was to identify independent, preoperative risk factors and to develop a simple risk score to predict 30-day mortality after PD.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   We reviewed all patients who underwent PD from 2005-2012 in the ACS-NSQIP databases.  Logistic regression was used to identify preoperative risks for 30-day mortality from a development cohort ([DEVEL] random 80% of the database).  The WHipple-ABACUS score was created using weighted beta coefficients and predictive accuracy was assessed on the validation cohort ([VALID] the remaining 20%) using a receiver operator characteristic curve and calculating the area under the curve (AUC).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  The 30-day mortality rate was 2.7% for patients who underwent PD (n=14,993).  The DEVEL identified 8 independent risk factors:  hypertension with medication, history of cardiac surgery, age &gt; 62, bleeding disorder, albumin &lt;3.5g/dL, disseminated cancer, use of steroids and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).  The score created from weighted beta coefficients (see Figure) had an AUC=0.71 (95%CI 0.66 to 0.77) using the VALID.  Using the WHipple-ABACUS score:  WHipple-ABACUS = hypertension With medication + History of cardiac surgery + Age&gt;62 + 2*Bleeding disorder + Albumin&lt;3.5g/dL + 2*disseminated Cancer + 2*Use of steroids + 2*SIRS, mortality rates increase with increasing score (p&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  While other risk scores exist for 30-day mortality after PD, we present a simple, validated score developed using exclusively preoperative predictors that surgeons should use to optimize co-morbidities and inform patients of risk with this procedure.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Most analyses are single-institution studies performed over long time periods or come from administrative databases with poorly defined surgical outcomes. Thus, the aims of this study were to characterize the risk factors associated with poor outcomes in surgically managed volvulus patients using a large, contemporary database with well-defined 30-day outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The 2012 and 2013 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) Participant Use Files were employed for this analysis. Standard ACS-NSQIP definitions were used for patient, procedure and outcome data. Eight preoperative variables were combined as a composite to determine patient frailty. Patients with five more of these variables were determined to be frail. Primary outcomes of interest were overall and serious morbidity as well as 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic leak and return to the operating room (OR).   STATA 13.1 was used for univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Colorectal resection was performed for volvulus in 903 of 29,219 patients (3.1%). The mean age was 49.5 years, but 334 patients (37.0%) were 75 years or older. Three hundred seventy-eight were men (41.9%), 691 were Caucasian (76.5%) and 95 were African American (10.5%). Ninety-five were frail (10.5%) and fourteen had significant weight loss (1.6%). Fifty-eight percent of the operations were performed emergently.  A stoma was performed in 164 patients (18.2%), most frequently with partial colectomy (27.2%). Outcomes for all patients as well as for those who were frail or had a stoma are presented in the Table.Factors that were independently associated with overall morbidity included age 75 years or more (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.16-2.26, p&lt;0.01), male sex (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.09-2.02, p&lt;0.02), African American race (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.01-2.58, p&lt;0.05) and weight loss (OR 5.04, 95% CI 1.50-16.97%, p&lt;0.01). BMI, emergent procedure and operative approach did not influence overall morbidity.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Outcomes of colonic resection for volvulus are worse in the elderly and frail as well as in African Americans and men. Performance of a stoma may reduce the risk of an anastomotic leak. The decision to perform surgery in these high-risk patients should be undertaken with caution.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Unequal receipt of such care may prevent full recovery in underprivileged patients. Disparities in utilization of Acute Care Surgery (ACS) have been documented, but little is known about disparities in post-discharge rehabilitation services. This study sought to determine whether disparities exist in the receipt of post-discharge rehabilitation in ACS patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2007-2011) was queried for adult patients (&ge;18y) with an ACS primary diagnosis, including trauma and emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST). Two trauma subgroups &ndash; traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) &ndash; were analyzed separately, as evidence suggests that they have specific rehabilitation needs. Patients that died in hospital were excluded and inpatients who survived were assessed for differential receipt of post-discharge inpatient rehabilitation. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine independent predictors of discharge to rehabilitation, adjusting for influence of patient- (age, race, gender, insurance status, income, disease severity, complications) and hospital- (volume, teaching status, location, bed size, geographical region) level covariates and accounting for clustering of patients within hospitals. Trauma, TBI and SCI models were further adjusted for Injury Severity Score (ISS).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 5,228,453 patient records were included, weighted to represent 26,353,162 patients nationwide. Among ACS patients, 27.4% (n=1,460,934) were admitted for trauma and 72.6% (n=3,872,622) for EGS. Of these 133,439 (2.6%) were discharged to rehabilitation facilities. In the sub-groups, 7.7% of trauma, 0.6% of EGS, 6.5% of SCI and 2.3% of TBI patients were discharged to rehabilitation facilities. Black and Hispanic patients had 15-43% lower risk-adjusted odds of rehabilitation discharge relative to White patients, for both trauma and EGS diagnosis. Similarly, Medicaid beneficiaries (OR: 0.90 [0.87-0.93]) and uninsured patients (OR: 0.38 [CI: 0.37-0.40]) were less likely to be discharged to inpatient rehabilitation after trauma. ACS Patients treated at teaching (OR: 1.44 [CI: 1.42-1.46]) and urban (OR: 1.80 [CI: 1.75-1.83]) hospitals were more likely to be discharged to rehabilitation facilities. These findings persisted in the SCI sub-group analysis but became non-significant for the TBI group.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Historically disadvantaged minorities, Medicaid beneficiaries, and those treated at rural and non-teaching centers had disparate receipt of inpatient rehabilitation, which may limit recovery. Further work should investigate the implications of these findings on post-operative and post-injury functional and quality-of-life outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Using a nationally representative sample, this study examined associations between hospital teaching status and surgical outcomes among EGS patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adult patients (&ge;18y) with a primary ICD-9 code for an EGS condition were identified in the 2007-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Analyses included only patients with complete data (except for race) who were non-electively admitted and underwent operative procedures. Cases were categorized into those managed at TH versus NTH and assessed for differences in patient- and hospital-level factors. Stratified analyses were conducted within the following diagnostic groups: colorectal pathology, intestinal obstruction, appendiceal disorder, hernias and vascular pathology. Outcomes included: major complications, in-hospital mortality, non-routine discharge, length of stay (LOS), and total hospital cost. Data were weighted to obtain national estimates, and clustering of patients within hospitals was accounted for. A combination of coarsened-exact matching and multivariable logistic/linear (family gamma, link log) regression was used to adjust for potential confounding. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A weighted total of 18,915,504 adult patients with complete data were admitted to inpatient care with EGS conditions between 2007-2011, 40.26% of whom were treated at THs.  Overall, 6,395,624 (33.81%) underwent operations of which 69.02% were non-elective (64.82% in TH and 72.06% in NTH). The most common diagnoses within each of the 5 diagnostic groups listed were: diverticulitis, intestinal/peritoneal adhesion with obstruction, acute appendicitis, ventral hernia and arterial embolism, respectively. The odds of mortality was higher for all operatively managed EGS patients in TH (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.13), which was also true for the most common diagnoses for colorectal pathologies (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73) and intestinal obstructions (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02-1.36), but not for the other 3 conditions. Interestingly, the odds of extended LOS was increased among patients with the most common diagnoses in colorectal pathology, intestinal obstruction and hernias if treated at TH, but was decreased for acute appendicitis. Treatment at TH was associated with increased odds of having total cost exceed the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile among patients with intestinal obstruction or ventral hernia. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Differences in patient diagnosis-specific case-mix may account for much of the previously reported variability in EGS outcomes between TH and NTH. Future research should carefully consider the broad spectrum of diagnoses that constitute EGS conditions.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Up to 20% of individuals with diverticulosis will require hospitalization with 20-50% of these patients requiring operative intervention, resulting in an estimated annual cost of $2.6 billion. This study aims to examine the postoperative outcomes in the setting of emergent surgical management of diverticulitis, and then try to examine if these changes correlated with changes in surgical practice.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data was obtained from the ACS NSQIP PUFs from 2005 to 2013. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing emer-gency surgery with a post-operative diagnosis of diverticula of the colon or diverticulitis with or without mention of hemorrhage. Multivariate regression models were developed using trends in pre-, intra- and postoperative variables identified through univariate analyses. The impact of practice variables were analyzed using multivariate regression models, adjusting for biases in surgical approach due to preoperative patient factors by including propensity scores for each practice variable.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Preoperative comorbidities dyspnea, dependent functional status, ascites and &gt;10% weight loss significantly decreased over the study period. Intraoperative variables ASA class 2 and clean/contaminated wound class significantly decreased over the study period. ASA class 3 and the dirty/infected wound class increased. Of the postoperative variables considered, length of stay, ventilator dependency, and renal insufficiency decreased while organ space surgical site infection and sepsis increased. Multivariate analyses of pre- and intraoperative variable as explanatory factors of postoperative complications suggested several significant relationships, notably ascites and dyspnea with worse outcomes and ASA classes 2 and 3 with better outcomes. The odds ratios for laparoscopy and stoma creation over time were statistically significant but very close to 1 (95% CI between 1.00-1.09).Laparoscopy was significantly associated with decreased odds of several surgical complications, regardless of propensity score adjustment. The stoma creation variable was associated with increased odds of surgical complications, but these associations disappeared after propensity score adjustment. The drain placement variable was only significantly associated with an increased odds of sepsis.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In conclusion, this analysis suggests that a lack of substantial change in surgical practices for patients presenting with diverticulitis in the emergency setting is associated with a lack of consistent improvement in patient outcomes. This research adds to the existing evidence of the benefits of laparoscopic management of diverticulitis in the emergency setting.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Evaluation for and treatment of retained CBD stones may be performed using pre- or post-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or intra-operative cholangiogram (IOC).  Ideally, these investigations should be limited to only cases with high pre-test probability of retained stones, as routine investigation may result in unnecessary procedures and prolonged hospitalization.

Colectomy can be performed when other treatment options cannot provide reasonable quality of life to patients with ulcerative colitis or if dysplastic changes are identified on colonoscopy. Frailty has been used to assess the risks of colectomy in patients with various diagnoses.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: NSQIP cross-institutional database was used for this study. The database contains records of more than 139 variables from multiple surgery types around United States from 2005 until 2012. 650 patient records (n = 650) with a primary diagnosis of ulcerative colitis were identified and used in the study. 34.0% underwent laparoscopic (n = 221) and 66.00% open (n = 429) colectomies. Modified frailty index (mFI) is a previously described and validated 11-variable frailty measure used with NSQIP to assess frailty. Outcome measures included serious morbidity, overall morbidity, Clavien IV (requiring ICU), and Clavien V (mortality) complications. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Median age was 47 years, and BMI was 25.2Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. 52.8% of patients were males. 43.8% of patients were assigned ASA Class 3 or higher.

Lipomatous tumors, such as liposarcomas, are rare but can reach significant size. We hypothesized that some lipomatous tumors are metabolically active and can alter systemic glucose homeostasis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a retrospective study of patients who underwent surgical excision of a lipomatous tumor at a tertiary cancer referral center (2004-2015). We divided patients into non-diabetics, well-controlled diabetics (HbA1c &lt; 7), and poorly-controlled diabetics (HbA1c &ge; 7). We compared patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and measures of glycemic control among these groups both before and after tumor resection. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 203 patients underwent 235 operations for lipomatous tumors. No differences were observed in tumor characteristics in patients with and without diabetes. However, tumor characteristics differed significantly between the well-controlled and poorly-controlled diabetics (Table 1). Patients with poorly-controlled diabetes had larger tumors that were more likely to be malignant and well-differentiated. Interestingly, we identified seven patients whose diabetes significantly improved with tumor resection. Overall, in the poorly-controlled diabetic group, there was a significant improvement in random blood glucose (109 mg/dL vs. 176 mg/dL, p &lt; 0.05), without an associated change in BMI or number of diabetes medications, following tumor resection. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Development of a lipomatous tumor alone does not lead to diabetes. There was an association, however, between larger, malignant tumors and poorly-controlled diabetes. In a subset of patients, tumor resection improved glycemic control, suggesting that selected lipomatous tumors may be metabolically active.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

We investigated the incidence of complications associated with port placement and other factors.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective chart review of ports placed at a large community hospital over a five-year period was performed. Demographics, BMI, preoperative diagnosis, port site, site of venous access, duration of port period, stage/nature of port complication, and use of steroids, TPN, and chemotherapy were collected. Chi square, Mann-Whitney, and Fisher's Exact tests were used to analyze the data (SPSS Statistics 23.0, IBM, Armonk, NY).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of 289 total patients, 68.2% were female. The mean age, BMI, and port duration were 57.6&plusmn;13.5 years, 30.1&plusmn;8.5 kg/m&sup2;, and 291.7&plusmn;192.5 days, respectively. The port sites were well balanced between the right and left chest wall (51.9% and 48.1%). Right chest wall placement had double the complication incidence compared to left chest wall placement (16.7% vs. 7.9%, p=0.024). Complications most commonly associated with right chest wall placement were port pocket infection and catheter related blood stream infection.  Complications did not differ by venous access (internal jugular vein=13.8% vs. subclavian=11.1%, p=0.49). Complication incidence was nearly three times greater in steroid users vs. non-users (22.2% vs. 8.3%, p=0.016).  Complication incidence did not differ between patients given or not given chemotherapy (p=0.24) or TPN (p=0.69). Moreover, there was no relationship between age, gender, port site, and venous access site and those complications that occurred five or more times (port pocket infection, catheter-related infection, and malfunctioning ports).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:These results suggest that the placement of ports in the right chest wall and steroid use could lead to a higher incidence of complications. The application of these findings could decrease complications related to port placement and improve both patient care and outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

ICD-9 codes were used to identify all patients who underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 341,376 discharge records were included. 55,485 (16.3%) patients had appendectomy on the next day of admission, while 70,701 (24.7%) patients had the operation on weekends. Next day operations were more likely to be associated with postoperative complications [OR: 1.22, 95%CI (1.14, 1.30), p&lt;0.001]. A hospital stay of more than 3 days was also more common for next day interventions (p&lt;0.001). Appendectomies performed on weekends had a higher risk of complications compared to other days [OR: 1.09, 95%CI (1.02, 1.17), p=0.009].

Despite adherence to Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) criteria, the rate of SSIs remains high. Therefore, several efforts have been directed towards preoperative strategies to reduce SSIs. We have previously demonstrated that a decontamination protocol using chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) washcloths and intranasal povidone-iodine (PI) is effective in decreasing SSIs in patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. Our objective was to determine the impact of this decontamination protocol on SSIs in patients undergoing elective surgery across four surgical services.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was used to identify patients undergoing elective surgery from 2013 to 2015. The preoperative decontamination protocol consists of patients watching an educational video on decontamination at the preoperative visit and applying the CHG washcloths and oral rinse the night before and the morning of surgery, and the intranasal PI the morning of surgery. Participating services included general surgery (GS), neurosurgery (NS), orthopedic surgery (OS), and vascular surgery (VS). Widespread implementation of this protocol at our center began in 10/2014.  Rates of SSI were captured through the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 10/2013 to 6/2014 during the pre-intervention period and from 10/2014 to 6/2015 during the post-intervention period. Outcomes were compared by wound class (clean vs. clean contaminated) and by surgical specialty. During the entire study period, there were no differences in patient management or SCIP compliance. Univariate analysis was performed using chi-square.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 4952 cases were evaluated (pre=2529, post=2423), of which 1682 were OS (pre=805, post=877), 1483 GS (pre=737, post=746), 941 VS (pre=534, post=407), and 846 NS (pre=453 post=393). Clean cases totaled 4194 (pre=2125, post=2069) and clean contaminated cases totaled 758 (pre=404, post=354). Overall, the SSI rate was significantly lower in the intervention group (pre=1.6% vs. post=0.9%; P=0.03). By surgical specialty, there was a significant decrease in SSIs in OS (pre=1.4% vs. post=0.3%; P=0.02) and a trend towards lower SSI rates in GS (pre=2.3% vs. post=1.9%; P=0.56), VS (pre=1.5% vs. post=0.5%; P=0.14), and NS (pre=1.1% vs. post=0.8%; P=0.57). By wound class, there was a significant decrease in SSIs in clean cases (pre=1.1% vs. post=0.4%; P=0.01), and a trend towards lower SSI rates in clean contaminated cases (pre=4.2% vs. post=3.7%; P=0.71).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our data demonstrates that widespread implementation of a preoperative decontamination protocol decreases SSIs among patients undergoing elective surgery, specifically for surgeries with a clean wound class. This protocol may be a preventative strategy for SSIs and warrants further study.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Patient, surgeon and system factors all contribute to inpatient mortality, and sophisticated risk adjustment is required to assess outcomes. When mortality of general surgical patients was determined to be high at a safety-net hospital (53% Medicaid/Medical Assistance), a comprehensive approach was undertaken to improve patient survival. The aim of this analysis is to demonstrate that risk-adjusted mortality can be improved at an essential hospital through implementation of numerous best practices.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: General surgical service line mortality was measured in the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) database from January 2013 through March 2015. Ten best practices were sequentially undertaken to reduce observed (O) and/or increase expected (E) mortality. These quality efforts included a) recruitment of new surgeons, b) participation in ACS-NSQIP, c) hardwiring Surviving Sepsis elements, d) increasing the number of diagnostic codes submitted, e) standardizing documentation in Preoperative Anesthesia Testing, f) expanding Palliative Care consultations, g) implementing an aspiration prevention protocol, h) initiating 100% mortality review, i) adopting an Early Warning System to detect sepsis and j) enhancing patient selection and preparation for surgery. UHC mortality rank, O, E and O/E ratios as well as early deaths were compared with control charts for the 27-month analysis. Statistical significance was set at the p&lt;0.05 level. Case Mix Index, a financial metric which correlates positively with patient severity and procedure complexity, was monitored over the same time period.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:UHC general surgery mortality rank improved from the bottom decile to the top quartile among 102 Academic Medical Centers.

Published data are largely limited to small, single institution studies. Our aim was to compare post-operative outcomes between HAL vs. standard laparoscopic (SL) approaches on a population level.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The 2012-2013 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Data Use File was queried for patients undergoing elective SL or HAL colectomy. Patients were classified by surgical approach, underwent 1:1 propensity matching with a nearest neighbor algorithm, and had outcomes compared. An additional subgroup analysis was performed for patients undergoing segmental resections only.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 13,949 patients were identified, of whom 6,084 (43.6%) underwent HAL colectomy. Following propensity matching, patients undergoing HAL vs. SL colectomy had higher rates of post-operative ileus (8.7% vs. 6.3%, p&lt;0.001), wound complications (8.8% vs. 6.8%, p=0.006), and 30-day readmission (7.5% vs. 6.0%, p=0.002), without any differences in operative time (156 vs. 157 minutes, p=0.713). When considering only segmental colectomies, HAL remained associated with significantly higher rates of wound complications (8.6% vs. 6.5%, p=0.016), post-operative ileus (8.9% vs. 6.3%, p&lt;0.001), and 30-day readmission (7.1% vs. 5.9%, p=0.041). There was again no difference in operative time between HAL and SL (145 vs. 145 minutes, p=0.334). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Use of hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomy is associated with increased risk of wound complications, post-operative ileus, and readmissions. Importantly, this technique is not associated with any decrease in operative time. Our results suggest that utilization of hand-assisted technique should be discouraged, given its inferior outcomes.

This volume initiative had evidence from a direct relationship between hospital volume and surgical outcomes across a variety of procedures. However, the variability of performance among low-volume hospitals has not been thoroughly explored. We investigated whether low volume hospitals are able to reach the same surgical outcomes standards set by high-volume centers.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using ICD -9 codes and the 2010 National Inpatient Survey, we analyzed 194 hospitals performing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic gastric sleeve gastrectomy, and laparoscopic gastric banding. Hospitals were divided into low volume (LV) hospitals (&lt; 50 cases annually) and high volume (HV) hospitals (&ge; 50 cases annually) based on the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program standards (MBSAQIP). All patients with a prior history of cancer, IBD, UC, and FAP were excluded from analysis. All continuous variables were compared using t-test and weighted to represent national estimates. Statistical significance was defined as p &lt; .05. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Surgical outcomes at 110 LV hospitals and 84 HV hospitals were analyzed. Both groups had similar proportions of complex patients based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (score &ge; 1: .555 vs. .560, p = .8891). Most strikingly, 20 (18%) low volume hospitals met or exceeded the standards set by high volume centers in length of stay, complications, mortality, and discharge to home. On average, patients at HVH had a shorter inpatient stay (2.42 days vs. 4.21 days, p=.&lt;.001) and had significantly less complications (.2211 vs. .5271, p=.0003) with a smaller proportion of patients experiencing any complications (15% vs 25%, p=.001).

Inclusion criteria narrowed those cases to enterectomies, colectomies or combined as the initial operation.  Univariate correlations were examined between mortality and pre-operative comorbidities, post-operative complications, and operations performed.  A multivariate logistic regression model, controlled for age, gender and race was developed to evaluate the most significant univariate correlations.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:5237 cases met the inclusion criteria and constituted the analysis group.  Overall mortality rate was 28.7%.  There were 1978 cases of isolated enterectomies, 2949 cases of isolated colectomies and 310 cases of combined resections.  Mortality rates were 24.2%, 29.4% and 50.6% respectively.  The increased risk of death with a combined small and large bowel resection was 2.74 (OR 95% CI 2.17-3.45).  Pre-operative variables that most significantly increased the risk of death were ventilator dependence (OR 4.1, 95% CI 4.1-5.5), sepsis (OR 3.37, 95% CI 2.84-3.98), renal failure (OR 2.95, 95% CI 2.16-3.1), blood transfusion (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.9 - 3.0) and time to OR from hospital admission greater than one day (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.7-2.2).  Post-operative outcomes that most significantly increased the risk of death were cardiac arrest (OR 10.2, 95% CI 6.69-15.48), septic shock (OR 2.4, 95% CI - 1.64-3.51), intra-operative blood transfusion (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.5), renal failure (OR 1.87, 95% CI - 1.4-2.6), and post-operative blood transfusion (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.9).

Early and delayed LC are the two practiced approaches while there is inconclusive evidence regarding which is superior. At our medical center delayed cholecystectomy is practiced due to logistical constraints. The aim of this study is to evaluate the advantages and limitations of delayed LC in a large tertiary center. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective analysis of all patients admitted to our medical center with ACC between the beginning of 2003 and the end of 2012 was performed. Data collected included patient demographics and comorbidities, presenting symptoms, laboratory findings, blood cultures and imaging results. Data also included length of stay (LOS), time until surgery, and surgical complications.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the study period 1078 patients were admitted to our institution with the diagnosis of ACC. Of the entire cohort there were 593 females (55%) and the mean age was 57&plusmn;1.5 years.

It has been associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients over 65 years. Yet it is not part of the routine screening process in geriatric care. Computed tomography (CT) scan at the lumbar site L3 has been used as the gold standard tool to identify sarcopenia. Unfortunately high cost, limited availability, and radiation exposure limits the use of CT. We propose ultrasonography (US) of the thigh muscle as a possible objective, feasible, reproducible, portable, and risk free tool that can evaluate sarcopenia. The aim of this study was to evaluate US as a tool for the assessing sarcopenia in elderly patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   We recruited 38 patients over 65 years old, referred to the Acute Care Surgery service. Using Sonosite US, thigh muscle thickness (measured at the midpoint between the greater trochanter, 10cm below and lateral to ASIS) was standardized to patient height. CT scan images at L3 were analyzed through SliceOmatic. Skeletal muscle index was calculated using skeletal muscle surface area. Sarcopenia was defined as skeletal muscle index &lt; 41cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> for females and &lt;43cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> or &lt; 53cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> for males (with BMI &lt;25kg/m<sup>2</sup> or &gt;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Rockwood Clinical Frailty score (1-3 non frail, &gt;4 frail) was used to assess patient condition.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  The mean age of our preliminary study group was 78 &plusmn; 8 years and 68% (n=26) were females. Demographic, body composition, US and CT data of patients are described in Table 1. Sarcopenia was identified through CT in 69% of the patients. Sarcopenic patients had a greater number of in-hospital complications (48% vs 16.6% in non-sarcopenic, p =0.0001). There was no difference in duration of stay between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients (14 vs 11 days, p=0.06). There were significant differences between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic females in skeletal muscle surface area (113 &plusmn; 9 versus 91 &plusmn; 10 cm<sup>2</sup>, p &lt; 0.001), and skeletal muscle index (35.2 versus 46.3 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>, p&lt; 0.001). CT scan skeletal muscle index of sarcopenic patients showed significant correlation with frailty score (r<sup>2</sup>=0.21, p&lt;0.05). US of rectus femoris in females was significantly associated with frailty score (r<sup>2</sup>=0.19, p=0.008). The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) for thigh ultrasound was not able to distinguish sarcopenic patients (area ROC curve=0.6, p=0.8).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  CT identified sarcopenia was associated with high-risk frail patients.

Many patients with benign neoplasms in colon and rectum undergo colectomy to prevent the development of malignancy. Preoperative serum albumin has been used to predict postoperative complication rates in colectomies.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  NSQIP cross-institutional database was used for this study. The database contains records of more than 139 variables from multiple surgery types around United States from 2005 until 2012. 2068 patient records (n = 2,068) with a primary diagnosis of benign colorectal neoplasm who had elective colectomy performed were identified and used in the study. 75.48% underwent laparoscopic (n = 1,561) and 24.52% open (n = 507) colectomies. Preoperative serum albumin is a previously described and validated metric to describe the risk of surgery. Outcome measures included serious morbidity, overall morbidity, Clavien IV (requiring ICU), and Clavien V (mortality) complications. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Median age was 65 years, and BMI was 28.0Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. 49.4% of patients were males. 45.9% of patients were assigned ASA Class 3 or higher. The median albumin was 4.1 (1.9 &ndash; 7.3). As preoperative serum albumin changed from less than 3.5 to 3.5 and above, overall morbidity decreased from 34.1% to 12.6% and serious morbidity decreased from 15.9% to 4.8%, respectively. The Clavien IV complications rate decreased from 9.4% to 2.5%. Mortality rate has decreased from 4.4% to 0.6%. All results were statistically significant at p&lt;0.01. On a multivariate analysis preoperative serum albumin was independent predictor of serious morbidity (Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR): 0.47, p&lt;0.05), overall morbidity (AOR: 0.48, p&lt;0.01), Clavien IV complication rates (AOR: 0.35, p&lt;0.05) and mortality (AOR: 0.08, p&lt;0.01), independent of age, sex, BMI, ASA class, modified frailty, type of colectomy (laparoscopic or open), and wound class.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: As future patients undergo elective colectomies in treatment of benign neoplasm, low preoperative serum albumin should be used as a proxy for postoperative complications helping patients and physicians make a better informed decision with regards to the surgery.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

We reviewed our experience at a large tertiary referral center to better understand the clinical and perioperative characteristics of this unique clinical entity.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: With IRB approval, all patients with a pathologic diagnosis of pheochromocytoma with a synchronous ipsilateral adrenal cortical adenoma from January 1994 through June 2015 were identified. Retrospectively extracted data included indications for adrenalectomy, diagnostic work-up (biochemical and radiographic), operative characteristics, pathologic findings, and postoperative complications.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We identified 16 cases of PSCA among 413 patients undergoing adrenalectomies for pheochromocytoma (3.9%). Mean patient age was 57 years (range: 29-78); 50% were male. Median BMI was 28.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (IQR 26.8, 30.8). In 12 cases (75%), the initial primary neoplasm was found incidentally on imaging for an unrelated issue. Only 8 cases (50%) were reported on imaging to have a synchronous ipsilateral neoplasm. The preoperative presumptive diagnosis included 9 pheochromocytomas (56%), 4 cortical adenomas (25%), and 3 PSCA (19%). Paroxysmal clinical symptoms of a pheochromocytoma were documented in 13 (81%) patients. Four patients (25%) were diagnosed preoperatively with clinically relevant autonomous cortisol overproduction (3 ACTH-independent, 1 ACTH-dependent). Two patients (13%) were diagnosed preoperatively with renin-independent hyperaldosteronism and both underwent adrenal venous sampling (AVS) with one patient developing hypertensive crisis during AVS. The initial surgical approach was laparoscopic (81%), open (13%), retroperitoneoscopic (6%). One laparoscopic operation was converted to open due to bleeding. No patient required transfusion, postoperative vasopressor support, ICU care, or reoperation. There was no other major morbidity. On pathology, mean pheochromocytoma size was 2.7 cm (range: 0.8-4.8) and mean cortical adenoma size was 1.8 cm (range: 0.3-4.4).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:An ipsilateral cortical adenoma was found in 3.9% of 413 adrenalectomies with a final pathologic diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Clinically important cortical hormone secretion was diagnosed in 38% of these patients; 25% had glucocorticoid secretory autonomy and 13% had hyperaldosteronism. Physicians should be aware that adrenal neoplasms with mixed findings on imaging and biochemistry may represent synchronous pheochromocytoma and a functional adrenal cortical adenoma. If cross-sectional imaging is suggestive of cortical and medullary neoplasms, biochemical evaluation for this rare co-occurrence to prevent perioperative complications from resection of an unexpected secretory cortical neoplasm should be performed. This should be done cautiously to prevent precipitation of a pheochromocytoma crisis.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Furthermore, the role of resident participation specifically in thyroid surgery is not well understood.  Therefore, we sought to determine whether teaching hospitals (THs) had disparate outcomes in a large, population level cohort of thyroidectomy patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We analyzed 9,798 patients who underwent thyroidectomy in the 2011 California State Inpatient (SID) and Ambulatory Surgery Databases (SASD).  To assess TH status, the SID and SASD were linked to the California Hospitals Utilization data.  Surgical procedures and outcome variables were defined by CPT and ICD-9 codes.  Outcomes were analyzed based on TH status using ANOVA, as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods.    <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The minority of the 9,798 thyroidectomies were performed at THs (20.4%).  Those patients treated at THs were similar to those at non-THs, but more likely to have thyroid cancer (42.1% vs. 31.7%), a total thyroidectomy (53.0% vs. 46.7%) or a lateral neck dissection (11.8% vs. 5.0%, p&lt;0.0001 for all).  Despite these differences, the overall complication and 30-day readmission rates were similar at TH and non-THs (9.1% vs. 8.9%, p=0.76, and 3.6% vs. 3.8%, p=0.65, respectively).  However, when analyzing specific complications, recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injuries were significantly more common at THs (1.9% vs. 0.9%, p&lt;0.0001), while hypoparathyroidism (1.0% vs. 0.7%, p=0.20) and reoperative hematoma (0.7% vs. 0.8%, p=0.55) were comparable.  In addition, the volume status of THs did not affect the RLN injury rate when examined as low (&lt;50 cases/yr), medium (50-130 cases/yr), and high (&gt;130 cases/yr) volume hospitals (p=0.15). Assessment of factors, other than TH status, that were associated with RLN injuries revealed that nerve injuries patients were similar in gender, but significantly (p&lt;0.001 for all) older (61.0 &plusmn; 16.4 vs. 53.3 &plusmn; 14.7 yrs), non-White (0.8% vs. 2.5%), not privately insured (38.4% vs. 62.7%),  more likely to have &gt;1 chronic medical condition (99.0% vs. 74.5%), thyroid cancer (6.7% vs. 1.7%), hypothyroidism (2.5% vs. 1.0%), and undergo total thyroidectomy (1.6% vs. 0.7%), or lateral neck dissection (4.8% vs. 0.9%).  Multiple logistic regression revealed that TH status was independently associated with RLN injury (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.54-3.83) when controlling for age, race, insurance type, comorbidities, thyroid cancer diagnosis, and procedure type.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While overall complication rates are not impacted when thyroidectomy is performed at a TH versus a non-TH, RLN injury rates are twice as high at TH.

EI has wide-reaching applications to the surgical field including teamwork, patient care, and job satisfaction. Positive linkage has been made between higher EI levels in both the patient-doctor relationship and physicians in a leadership role. The purpose of our systematic review was to evaluate the use of EI in surgical education and assess whether its prevalence has grown with the general acceptance of EI in many fields including medicine. A secondary aim was to compare the incorporation of EI in surgical education to other fields of graduate medical education.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A MEDLINE search was performed for publications containing both 'surgery' and 'emotional intelligence' with at least one term present in the title. Articles were included if EI in surgical education was considered a significant focus. The results were grouped by publication date in 5-year increments to identify temporal trends. A separate series of MEDLINE searches were performed with the phrase 'emotional intelligence' in any field and either 'surg*', 'internal medicine', 'pediatric', 'neurology', 'obstetric', 'gynecology', 'OBGYN', 'emergency', and 'psychiatr*' in the title with no constraints on publication date. OBGYN articles were combined in one category. Articles were included if they discussed resident education as the primary subject.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 25 articles satisfied the MEDLINE search criteria and 7 articles satisfied inclusion criteria. These were sorted by publication date with 0, 1, and 6 articles published between 2001-2005, 2005-2010, and 2010-2015, respectively. Notable trends include: 1) EI is partially inborn, but proven to be learned; 2) Surgical residents have higher EI than the national average; 3) Educational shifts are needed to improve outcomes for the surgeon, patient, health network, and community at large. The comparative data for articles on EI and resident education showed 8 in surgery, 2 in internal medicine, 0 in pediatrics, 0 in neurology, 0 in OBGYN, 0 in emergency, and 4 in psychiatry.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Integration of EI principles is a growing trend within surgical education. Emphasis has been placed on quantitative assessment of EI in residents and residency applicants. Further study is warranted on the integration process of EI in surgical education and its impact on patient outcomes and long-term job satisfaction.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

However, association between preoperative UTI and postoperative complications has not been evaluated in general surgery populations. We hypothesized that UTI present at the time of surgery is associated with higher incidence of short-term postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing elective general surgery. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients undergoing elective general surgical procedures from 2011-2013 were selected from the national American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) participant use file. Exclusion criteria included emergent procedures, ASA class 5 or unknown, preoperative ventilator-dependence, SIRS, sepsis, septic shock, and missing preoperative UTI data. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on presence or absence of UTI at the time of surgery and were then matched 1:2 (case:control) on age, ASA class, and primary CPT. Univariate analysis was performed using Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests to compare the two cohorts with regards to patient demographics, comorbidities, and postoperative complication rates. Postoperative morbidity was analyzed using multiple logistic regression to control for baseline differences between the two groups. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 434,802 patients were identified for inclusion in the study, with an overall preoperative UTI rate of 0.08% (n = 363). After matching, there were 353 patients with UTI and 706 without UTI. The two groups were similar with regards to age, BMI, ASA class, and most comorbidities.  There were more females, more Caucasians, fewer Hispanics, more inpatients, and higher frequency of dependent functional status, wound infection, weight loss, and preoperative transfusion in the UTI group. On univariate analysis, the UTI group had a significantly higher incidence of overall morbidity, infectious complications, and non-infectious complications (Table 1). The multivariate analysis confirmed a higher odds ratio of overall postoperative morbidity associated with preoperative UTI when controlling for baseline differences between the two groups (OR 1.504, 95% CI: 1.025-2.207). <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: We demonstrated an increased rate of 30-day complications in general surgery patients with UTI present at the time of surgery. As surgeons strive to provide safer, higher-quality care, these findings suggest there may be value in attempting to identify and treat UTI preoperatively in patients scheduled for elective general surgery procedures.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Additionally, previous literature has found that early identification of discharge destination may decrease the hospital length of stay and improve patient care planning. The purpose of this study was to identify preoperative predictors of discharge to higher level of care in patients undergoing colectomy. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients undergoing colectomy in 2012-2013 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) targeted colectomy database.  Exclusion criteria included death before discharge; discharge to a facility that was already home; unknown discharge destination; discharge to a separate acute care facility; outpatient surgery; and ASA Class 5 or unknown. Two cohorts were established based on discharge destination.  One group included all patients discharged to home, while the other consisted of those discharged to an increased level of care (ILC), which was defined as a skilled or unskilled nursing facility or rehab that was not originally home. Univariate analysis was performed using Chi-squared tests for categorical variables and Student's t-tests for continuous variables to identify patient characteristics, comorbidities, and operative factors associated with discharge to ILC. Variables with p-value &lt;0.1 on univariate analysis were included in a multivariate model in order to identify the variables with the largest independent contribution to discharge destination. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 36,492 patients were included in this study, with a rate of discharge to ILC of 11.2% (n = 4111).  The mean age of the ILC group was 73 years of age, compared to 60 years in those discharged to home (p=&lt;0.001). On univariate analysis, the ILC group had a significantly higher incidence of emergent cases, renal failure, insulin-dependent diabetes, preoperative wound infection, and preoperative systemic sepsis.  Multivariate analysis (Table 1) confirms a higher odds ratio of several comorbidities when controlling for cohort differences at baseline. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: As expected, discharge to an ILC was associated with a more dependent functional status, preoperative ventilator-dependence, and higher ASA class.

Readmission after combined multiple surgical procedures is common, but data comparing patterns of readmission are rare. We therefore sought to define the incidence of early versus late hospital readmission among patients experiencing combined major surgeries. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients discharged after ten major surgical procedures (CABG, AAA, carotid endarterectomy, aortic valve replacement, esophagectomy, gastrectomy, pancreatectomy, pulmonary resection, hepatectomy, colorectal resection) between 2010 and 2012 were identified from a large employer-provided health plan. Unplanned readmissions among patients who underwent combined surgical procedures were analyzed. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 3,358 patients experiencing combined major surgeries were identified? median patient age was 59 years, 69.6% were male, and 53.6% had Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of &ge;2. Median length-of-stay (LOS) was 8 (IQR 6-13) days. 2,933 (84.4%) of patients were discharged home of which 41.0% (n=1,162) were discharged home under care. 3.8% (n=127) of patients had died during the index hospitalization. Among the 723 (21.5%) patients who experienced readmission, 465 (13.8%) had a readmission within 30-days while 258 (7.7%) were readmitted within 31-90 days (Figure). Median time to readmission was 19 (IQR 8-44) days. In-hospital mortality (1.7% vs. 1.5%) and length-of-stay(4 vs. 3 days) were comparable among patients readmitted early and late(both P&gt;0.05). On multivariable analyses, CCI (&ge;2: Odds Ratio [OR] 1.63, 95%CI 1.37-1.94), LOS (OR 1.02, 95%CI 1.01-1.03) and postoperative complication (OR 1.26, 95%CI 1.06-1.51) were associated with 90 day readmission. The most common reason for early and late readmission were postoperative infection (12.7%) and pneumonia (3.9%), respectively. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: More than one third of readmissions occurred beyond 30-days after combined major surgical procedures.

Operative fixation techniques for hip fractures are taught with graduated levels of responsibility and involvement for the residents. Given the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with hip fractures in the elderly, understanding the effect of resident participation is important both to mitigate risk and to best prepare the next generation of surgeons. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of resident participation on outcomes in the treatment of IT hip fractures.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who underwent operative treatment for IT hip fractures with either extramedullary (CPT 27244) or intramedullary (CPT 27245) fixation were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database. Patients were grouped and analyzed according to surgical fixation type and status of resident participation (RP) for the procedure. Primary outcomes were death and serious morbidity, secondary outcomes included operative time, total anesthesia time, hospital length of stay and time to discharge. Non-parametric analysis was performed using Chi-squared and Wilcoxon ranked sum tests, as well as multivariate logistic regression analysis to examine the association between RP and significant outcomes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In 8,384 patients who underwent IT hip fracture fixation, data for RP was available for 21% of all cases (n=1764), with a rate of 31.3%. Residents at the PGY4 level most frequently assisted (26.9%). For all IT hip fractures, there were no statistically significant differences in 30-day mortality (7.8% vs 6.3%, p=.264), morbidity (43.2% vs 44.9%, p=.506) or overall death or serious morbidity (49.1% vs 48.1%, p=.699) in the RP and non-RP groups. The RP group did demonstrate a significant increase in some secondary outcome parameters (see Table). There was no significant difference in overall death or serious morbidity rate when EM (42.9% vs 47.6%, p=.296) and IM (51.8% vs 48.4%, p=.271) fixation were analyzed independently.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: RP in IT hip fracture fixation was not associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality for either EM or IM fixation. RP was associated with increased operative and anesthesia times in both EM and IM fixation, and with increased length of stay and time to discharge following operation in the IM group. Patients with IT hip fractures are at high risk for perioperative complications regardless of RP. While attending supervision is necessary, residents can and should be involved in the care of these patients without concern that resident involvement negatively impacts perioperative morbidity and mortality.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

A p value &le;0.05 was considered statistically significant.  A multivariable model was then constructed in stepwise fashion to assess for independent predictors of groin hematoma. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:From 6608 inguinal hernia repairs, 96 patients developed a groin hematoma.  The hematoma frequency increased from our previous study (1.4 % vs. 0.9%, p&lt;0.01). Mean age in this cohort was 64.6 years (range: 18-92) and 84.3% were male.  48% of cases developed the hematoma within 48 hours of surgery. There was no significant difference in the location (left, right, bilateral), type (direct, indirect, pantaloon, first repair, or recurrent), or technique of hernia repair (Bassini, Lichtenstein, mesh plug, laparoscopic, or McVay) between study and control groups.   Univariate analysis identified warfarin usage (OR 3.5, 95% CI [1.6, 6.4], p&lt;0.01), valvular disease (OR 11.6, 95% CI [2.6,51.3], p&lt;0.01), atrial fibrillation (OR 2.6, 95% CI [1.2,5.5], p=0.01), hypertension ( OR 2.03, 95% CI [1.1, 3.6],  p=0.02),  recurrent hernia (OR 3.7, 95% CI [1.4, 9.7], p&lt;0.01), and coronary artery disease (OR 2.1, 95% CI [1.0, 4.4 ], p=0.05) as significant preoperative factors. The proportion of patients with warfarin usage decreased since our prior report (31% vs. 42%, p=0.2). On multivariable regression, warfarin usage and recurrent hernia were independent predictors of groin hematoma development.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Groin hematoma after IHR has increased in frequency over the last decade at our institution. In our cohort, independent risk factors for the development of groin hematoma included warfarin use and recurrent hernia. Patients on warfarin therapy before elective IHR should be thoroughly assessed for appropriate cessation and resumption of anticoagulation prior to surgery. Surgical hypervigilance and meticulous hemostasis remains prudent in all patients undergoing IHR and especially those with recurrent inguinal hernia.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Introduction of 3D display might remove this technical obstacle and improve laparoscopic skills. There has been some reports demonstrated benefit of 3D imaging during simple laparoscopic procedure, such as cholecystectomy. It is still unclear whether 3D display also improve surgeons' skill in complicated laparoscopic surgery. We attempt to analyze the effect of 3D technology on operative performance during laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) for gastric cancer and to assess its advantages over 2D laparoscopy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Consecutive 18 patients (3D group: n=10, 2D group: n=8) who underwent LTG followed by esophagojejunostomy with overlap method were analyzed. All cases were operated by same established manner by a single surgeon experienced in laparoscopic gastric surgery. The surgical outcomes were compared between 3D and 2D group. Further, we compared 3D with 2D in each laparoscopic scenes (lymphadenectomy and reconstruction) by the performance time, the frequency of any bleeding required hemostasis, and the frequency of reset surgical view by assistant' forceps.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: All surgeries were completed without any complications. The total laparoscopic time was shorter in 3D group than 2D group (158 vs 195 min, P=0.045) and total blood loss was almost the same (86 vs 54 g, P=0.27) in between 2 group. The operative time was shorter in 3D group than 2D group during lymphadenectomy around celiac artery (26 vs 41 min, P&lt;0.01) and esophagojejunostomy with overlap method (30 vs 49 min, P=0.04). The frequency of reset surgical view by assistant' forceps were fewer only in lymphadenectomy around celiac artery (n=5.6 vs n=8.6, P&lt;0.01).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results showed that LTG using the stereoscopic vision of 3D display can be done in shorter operative time.

Knowledge of parathyroid gland location remains paramount, and provides the surgeon with a starting point for PTX when preoperative gland localization is unsuccessful. This purpose of this study was to determine any difference in the anatomic location for single abnormal parathyroid glands, which may help guide the surgeon in PTX when preoperative localization is unavailable or negative in patients with pHPT.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A retrospective review of prospectively collected data of 824 consecutive patients with pHPT who underwent initial PTX at a tertiary medical center was performed. All patients had elevated serum calcium and parathormone (PTH) levels above normal reference range, and single gland disease. Eutopic location of abnormal parathyroid glands in each patient was determined at time of operation, correlated with operative and pathology reports, and confirmed by operative success. Operative success was defined as continuous eucalcemia for &gt;6 months after PTX. Patients with MEN, secondary, tertiary or familial hyperparathyroidism, multiglandular disease (MGD), parathyroid cancer and ectopic glands were excluded. Data were analyzed by chi squared and Z test analyses.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of these patients, single abnormal parathyroid glands were not evenly distributed among their 4 eutopic locations in the neck (left superior, n=128 (15.5%), left inferior, n=259 (31.4%), right superior, n=131 (16%), right inferior, n=306 (37.1%); p&lt;0.0001). Abnormal inferior parathyroid glands were significantly more common than abnormal superior glands, respectively (n=565 (68.6%) vs. n=259 (31.4%); p &lt;0.0001). Overall, there was no significant difference in abnormal gland laterality (right, n=437 (53%) vs. left, n=387 (47%), p=0.08). However, in the subset of men, the most common location for abnormal parathyroid glands was right inferior position (43.5%, 95% CI 36.3-50.8% p&lt;0.0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This large series of patients with pHPT suggests that single eutopic abnormal parathyroid glands are more likely to be found in the inferior location. In women, this finding can be used in conjunction with intraoperative selective venous sampling and/or parathyroid hormone monitoring for further lateralization of abnormal gland position. In men, however, if an abnormal parathyroid gland is not localized preoperatively, the right inferior location should be explored first. Nevertheless, success of such operations remains predicated on knowledge of parathyroid anatomy and the experience and judgement of the surgeon.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

The purpose of this study is to describe the early postoperative outcomes of abdominal colorectal operations in solid organ transplant recipients at an academic medical center. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent an abdominal operation on the colon or rectum after solid organ transplantation at a single tertiary medical center between 2000 and 2014. Information regarding demographics, comorbidities, medications at the time of surgery, indications, operative details and 30-day outcomes were recorded. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 2539 patients underwent abdominal solid organ transplant between 2000 and 2014, of which 50 patients were identified that underwent 58 colorectal procedures following the transplant. The median age at colorectal surgery was 55 years and median time from transplantation to colon surgery was 4 years. The most common indication for colon surgery was diverticular disease with most patients having received a kidney, liver or lung. In this series, 45% of cases were performed emergently. Patients undergoing emergent operations were closer to the time of transplant (median time 11 months vs. 7 years, p=0.01) and were less likely to undergo primary anastomosis (7.7% vs. 84.4%, p&lt;0.001). Overall, median length of stay was 8 days and the rate of anastomotic leak was 10% in patients with a primary anastomosis. The 30-day readmission rate was 35% and 30-day mortality rate 3.5%.

We evaluated 4-year outcomes of VA patients following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in regards to weight, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HTN), hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and complications.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Consecutive patients who underwent RYGB or SG at the Dallas VA from 2003 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Collected data included demographics, weight, body mass index (BMI), comorbidity diagnoses, medications, and complications. Outcome means for weight and BMI were compared by t-test. Partial remission for T2DM was defined as: hemoglobin A1c &lt;6.5%, without medications. Remission was defined as: blood pressure &lt;140/90 mmHg without medications for HTN; triglycerides &lt;150 mg/dl without medications for hypertriglyceridemia; and HDL &gt;40 mg/dl without medications for low HDL. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:256 patients (59% male; mean age 53) underwent RYGB (n=159; 140/159 open technique) and SG  (n=97).

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that perioperative blood transfusion is an independent risk factor for postoperative complications following colectomy. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients undergoing colectomy from 2012-2013 were selected from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) targeted colectomy participant use file. Exclusion criteria included unavailability of preoperative hematocrit value, emergent operations, and ASA Class 5. Patients were divided into four groups based on receipt of perioperative blood transfusion: no transfusion, preoperative transfusion only, intra/postoperative transfusion only, or both. Univariate analysis using Chi-squared tests was performed to compare rates of postoperative complications between the four groups. Propensity scores were calculated separately for receipt of preoperative transfusion and intra/postoperative transfusion. Multivariate analysis was then performed utilizing a propensity score-adjusted multiple logistic regression model to predict 30-day postoperative complications.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 30,680 patients were included in the study, with an overall transfusion rate of 11.6% (n = 3572). On univariate analysis, transfusion was associated with significantly higher rates of postoperative morbidity (Table 1). The risk-adjusted multivariate model confirmed an increased risk of postoperative morbidity associated with preoperative transfusion alone (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.71), with intra/postoperative transfusion alone (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.92-2.31), and with both (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.82-3.16). When examining the impact of timing of transfusion, intra/postoperative transfusion was independently associated with a higher risk of postoperative morbidity compared to preoperative transfusion (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23-1.95). Finally, preoperative transfusion is not associated with a significant change in 30-day postoperative complications in the setting of either mild/moderate anemia (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.91-1.50) or severe anemia (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.84-2.59).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this study, we found that transfusion is an independent predictor of postoperative complications. While it is clear that sicker patients tend to receive transfusions, these findings suggest that at a minimum, transfusion is a marker of worse surgical outcomes, and possibly even contributes to postoperative morbidity. Furthermore, based on this retrospective data, anemic patients do not appear to benefit from preoperative transfusion, and therefore empiric preoperative transfusion may be exposing the patient to unnecessary risks.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

In an effort to prevent this complication, parathyroid glands can be autografted during thyroidectomy. Our aim was to identify factors that increased the likelihood of a parathyroid autograft (PA) during thyroidectomies.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A database of patients undergoing thyroidectomy between 2008-2014 was queried. Frequency of PA, lobe and location of parathyroid, preoperative diagnosis, and type of procedure performed were analyzed. PA was performed when the parathyroid was inviable or in the specimen, and by finely mincing parathyroids and then injecting with a 14 gauge angiocatheter into the sternocleidomastoid muscle. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 856 patients were analyzed with an autograft rate of 33.5% (n=286). PA occurred more frequently of the inferior parathyroids at 53.7% (n=153) compared to 27% (n=77) of the superior parathyroids and 19.3% (n=55) of both. All parathyroids were identified in 32.5% of cases (n=277).  A single parathyroid was autografted in 211 cases, two in 66 and three in 9. On multivariate analysis, total thyroidectomy (TTX) (OR 16.5, p=&lt;0.001), partial thyroidectomy (OR 4.6, p=0.047), and the identification of all parathyroids (OR 4.7, p=&lt;0.001) were associated with increased use of PA. However, gland size, preoperative diagnosis and lymph node dissection did not increase the use of PA. Postoperative PTH was routinely measured in 138 patients undergoing TTX, and the rate of transient hypoparathyroidism was 35.5% (n=49); no patients developed PH. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We conclude PA is an effective adjunct to all thyroidectomies and is strongly associated with a TTX.

Wang<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Nevada School Of Medicine,Division Of Otolaryngology-Head And Neck Surgery, Department Of Surgery,Las Vegas, NV, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (iPTH) assay is frequently employed as a predictive marker for postoperative hypocalcemia in total thyroidectomy and as an outcome measure in parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. However, studies have shown that, while parathyroid hormone (PTH) is primarily regulated by serum calcium levels, it is also partly influenced by alpha-adrenergic stimulation.  In fact, the induction of general anesthesia with laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation has been shown to increase catecholamine secretion significantly, thus causing a surge in PTH. At this time, the implication of these findings is not well understood in head and neck endocrine surgery. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of anesthesia on iPTH in total thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy and to understand the implications of the relationship in using iPTH as a surgical outcome parameter. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a prospective cohort study with chart review. Thirty-seven patients undergoing total or completion thyroidectomy and seventeen patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism at a tertiary level academic center and a community hospital between November 2014 and July 2015 were enrolled. PTH was measured at least at four time-points: pre-anesthesia (immediately prior to surgery), pre-incision (following anesthesia induction but before skin incision), post-excision (following complete excision of a thyroid or parathyroid gland) and post-operative (12 hours and beyond). Normal intact PTH was defined as 11.1 - 79.5 pg/ml. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:iPTH increased globally following anesthesia induction and endotracheal intubation. In the total and completion thyroidectomy group, the mean pre-anesthesia and pre-incision PTH were 55.9 &plusmn; 15.2 pg/ml and 138 &plusmn; 42.2 pg/ml, respectively. The mean percentage increase from pre-anesthesia to pre-incision PTH was 149 &plusmn; 92.7% (range: 42 - 494%). In the parathyroidectomy group, the mean pre-anesthesia and pre-incision PTH were 176 &plusmn; 179 pg/ml and 254 &plusmn; 300 pg/ml, respectively. The mean percentage increase from pre-anesthesia to pre-incision PTH was 30.3 &plusmn; 38.6 % (range: 1 - 129%). The differences in PTH increases between two groups were significant (p&lt;0.05). PTH normalized postoperatively in all patients in both groups. No incidence of postoperative vocal cord paresis or paralysis was observed. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Parathyroid hormone rises following anesthesia induction and endotracheal intubation in total thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy. However, the response is significantly blunted in patients undergoing parathyroidectomy compared to the total thyroidectomy group.

Kelz<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Pennsylvania,Department Of Surgery,Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Uncommon operations are defined by the Surgical Council on Resident Education as rare, often urgent, operations. Outcomes of these procedures remain largely understudied. Uncommon operations may confer greater operative risk than complex operations and have the educational challenge of occurring infrequently. This study examines the incidence of post-operative events and the role of the resident following uncommon operations. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We identified uncommon general surgical operations using the ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Participant Use file (2008-2011). Death or serious morbidity (DSM) within 30 days of the operation was the primary outcome of interest. Failure to rescue (FTR) and prolonged operative time (PRopt) were examined as secondary outcome measures. PRopt was defined by procedure type as &ge; to the 90%ile of operative time. Resident participation was defined as resident involved (RI) or no resident involved (NRI), and stratified by post-graduate year (PGY): 1-3, 4-5, and 6+. Independent multivariate logistic regression models were developed to examine the association between any RI or PGY and outcomes. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Resident participant data was available for 21,453 (84.5%) of the uncommon operations with NRI in 25.4% (5,447) and participation by a PGY1-3 in 12.6% (2,699), a PGY4-5 in 50.4% (10,817), and a PGY6+ in 11.6% (2,490). The observed DSM rate was 28.6% and the observed FTR rate was 5.8%. Results of binary analyses are displayed in the prose and PGY results are seen in the table. Overall, there was no difference in DSM by RI status (NRI: 1,528; 28.1% vs RI: 4,602; 28.8%; p=0.324); however, the PGY level was associated with DSM (Table 1). Any RI was associated with a lower rate of FTR (5.1%) when compared to NRI (8.3%, p&lt;0.001) with decreasing FTR events by increasing PGY (Table 1). After adjustment for patient risk factors, any RI remained associated with a lower likelihood of FTR than NRI (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50-0.89) with decreasing likelihood of FTR by increasing PGY (Table 1). RI was associated with PRopt in univariate and multivariate analyses (Table 1). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Uncommon operations were associated with substantial DSM.  The involvement of PGY4-5 residents was associated with the greatest likelihood of DSM. Regardless of the PGY of the involved resident, all cases with RI demonstrated a lower likelihood of risk-adjusted FTR. The explanation for these findings is not clear; however, the involvement of more senior residents in the technical aspects of uncommon operations may lead to improved results.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Over two-thirds (n=633, 69.3%) of patients underwent surgery for a malignant disease. Patients undergoing surgery for a malignant disease were older (median 64 years vs. 59 years, p&lt;0.001), and more likely to be male (57.2% vs. 42.5%, p&lt;0.001). Of note, BMI was not different between patients undergoing surgery for malignant or benign disease (p=0.682). Sarcopenia and low MA were more common in patients with malignant disease (sarcopenia 27.7% vs. 19.3% in benign, p=0.007; low MA 27.5% vs. 19.3%, p=0.008). Among the entire cohort, patients presenting with SMD reported a higher incidence of postoperative complications (31.6% vs. 15.8% in non-SMD patients, p&lt;0.001), as well as longer length of stay (median 11 days [IQR 7, 16] vs. 8 days [IQR 6, 12] in non-SMD patients, p&lt;0.001). Among the patients undergoing surgery for malignant disease, patients with SMD had a higher risk of death than patients without SMD (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9; p=0.01). On multivariate analysis, SMD was remained as an independent predictor for both complication (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.14-3.15; p=0.01) and a worse overall survival (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.04-2.67; p=0.03).<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Sarcopenia and low MA are more common in patients undergoing HPB surgery for malignant disease compared to patients with benign disease. SMD is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients undergoing HPB surgery.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Shaw<sup>1</sup>, G. C. Kowdley<sup>1</sup>, J. A. Sanchez<sup>1</sup>, S. C. Cunningham<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Saint Agnes Hospital Center And Cancer Institute,Surgery,Baltimore, MD, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:   Accidental punctures and lacerations (APL) during the surgical care of hepatobiliary (HPB) patients are not infrequent and are often preventable. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicator #15 (PSI-15) was created to determine rates of APL. Unfortunately, using the indicator alone may be insufficient to fully understand the nature of these events in a large dataset. Another approach to APL rates is using diagnostic and procedural codes (ICD-9), which may identify these events indirectly. We hypothesized that these two approaches, PSI-15 and a composite measure of relevant ICD-9 codes, would yield different incidences of APL, and that this information can provide a more accurate picture of the frequency and characteristics of APL events.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Using the National Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project for 2000&ndash;2012, we analyzed all cholecystectomies plus pancreatic and liver resections. All PSI-15 codes were examined and rates were calculated using AHRQ software. Cases were divided in to two groups, those carrying the PSI-15 marker of APL, and those not.  We then determined the frequency of all procedural and diagnostic ICD-9 codes shared by both groups, and selected those codes with the most discordance. Pairwise comparisons (chi-square tests) of each selected code against PSI-15 as a surrogate of APL presence were determined. Diagnostic (n=54) and procedural (n=12) codes that significantly increased the odds of having a PSI-positive finding (with 95% CIs that did not include 1) were selected for inclusion into one composite measure (CM) of APL. Both CM and PSI-15 were plotted along a timeline. Seasonal trends decomposition and log-linear Poisson regression analyses were carried out to test for observed significance of trends over time.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The rate of PSI-15 varied from 1.2% in 2000 to a flat maximum of 1.5% in 2007 and back to 1.1% in 2012. Rates of the composite marker gradually increased from 3.1% in 2000) to plateau at 3.7% in 2011. A Poisson regression analysis of both trends, for PSI-15 and for CM, demonstrated statistical significance (p&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The ICD-9 codes in our CM occurred more frequently than PSI-15.  In general, both measures trend similarly over time with CM exhibiting larger variation. The divergence seen between these two curves in 2007 may be associated with known changes in Diagnosis Related Groups at that juncture and, possibly, reimbursement policy involving adverse events. While arguably less specific, CM may increase sensitivity for detecting APL events during HPB operations in comparison to PSI-15.  These results may also inform the interpretation of APL studies using either PSI-15 or ICD-9 approaches.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Currently, 10% of surgeons practice bilateral neck exploration(BNE), 68% use a minimally invasive approach(MIP), and 22% have a mixed practice. We sought to determine the reasons for failure of MIP as compared to failure of BNE. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who underwent reoperative surgery for recurrent or persistent disease were identified in our institutional prospective endocrine surgery registry(1997 to 2013) for the study. The primary outcome of interest was reason for failure of the initial surgery determined by intra-operative findings and pathologic review. Univariate analysis was performed to examine differences across reoperative patients who underwent BNE compared to those who underwent MIP as the initial procedure using the Chi-square test, as appropriate. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of 141 patients who met study criteria, 28% (n=39) had undergone MIP and 72% (n=102) BNE. Patient characteristics including age, race, gender, body mass index, calcium, PTH level and symptoms were similar across the two groups. Recurrent disease was associated with abnormal glands in ectopic locations (n=45), adenomas in normal positions(n=33), hyperplasia(n=25), MEN-associated hyperplasia(n=21), parathyroid cancer(n=6), abnormal supernumerary glands(n=5), and parathymatosis (n=4). Reoperation failed to identify the cause of failure in 2 patients. A single parathyroid adenoma was the most common cause of operative failure following MIP. Adenoma in a normal location was more common following MIP than BNE (43.59% vs 15.09%, p=0.005). In BNE failures, ectopic gland was the most common cause. The frequency of failure due to ectopic gland was greater amongst BNE when compared to MIP(31 % vs. 7%, p=0.005). In initial MIP, IOPTH monitoring was used in 45% (n=17) of patients. Of these patients, 4 had intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) levels which failed to normalize; 3 had incorrect interpretation of IOPTH. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Failure following MIP is often due to a missed adenoma in a normal location as opposed to failure following BNE, which is often associated with a missed ectopic gland. All patients should be counseled on the possibility of an ectopic gland prior to parathyroid exploration. Experienced surgeons preferably skilled in the use of IOPTH monitoring should perform MIP to avoid unnecessary failure.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Race and socioeconomic status have been implicated in disparities of rectal cancer treatment and resection. Our aim was to determine the impact of patient race and medical insurance on use of minimally invasive (MIS) compared to open techniques for rectal cancer resections in the United States. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adult patients undergoing MIS rectal resections (laparoscopic or robotic) for stage I-III rectal adenocarcinoma were included from the National Cancer Data Base (2010-2012). Multivariate analyses were employed to identify factors independently associated with use of MIS vs. open resection.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 23,274 patients were included: 9,164 (39%) underwent MIS and 14,110 (61%) open surgery. Overall, 86% were white, 8% black, 3% Asian, and 2% identified as &lsquo;other.' In unadjusted analysis, factors associated with use of open vs. MIS were black race, Medicare/Medicaid insurance, and lack of medical insurance. However, after adjustment for patient demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics, black race was not associated with use of MIS vs. open surgery (OR 0.90, p=0.07). With adjustment, compared to privately insured patients, uninsured patients (OR 0.52, p&lt;0.01) and those with Medicare/Medicaid (OR 0.79, p&lt;0.01) were less likely to receive minimally invasive resections. Lack of insurance was significantly associated with less frequent use of MIS (OR 0.59, p=0.02) in black patients and (OR 0.51, p&lt;0.01) in white patients.  Across all uninsured patients, black race was not associated with lower frequency of MIS approach (OR 0.96, p=0.59).   <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Medical insurance status, not race, is associated with utilization of minimally invasive techniques for oncologic rectal resections.

Patients were stratified into three groups: laparoscopic colectomy (LC), converted laparoscopic to open colectomy (CC), and open colectomy (OC). Multivariable modeling was applied to compare perioperative and oncologic outcomes from CC and LC to open colectomy while adjusting for patient, clinical, and tumor characteristics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 104,400 patients were included: 40,328 (38.63%) had LC, 6,144 (5.89%) CC, 57,928 (55.48%) OC.

The mechanisms that drive these differences in outcomes are poorly defined. We examined the extent to which the utilization of critical care resources explains disparate outcomes between low mortality hospitals (LMHs) and high mortality hospitals (HMHs).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All hospitals participating in the National Cancer Database (2006-2007) were ranked on risk-adjusted mortality for major bladder, colon, esophagus, gastric, lung and pancreas cancer resections. Onsite chart reviews were performed at 19 LMHs (risk-adjusted mortality rate 2.4%) and 30 HMHs (risk-adjusted mortality rate 6.7%), abstracting information on perioperative care, complications and mortality. Using logistic regression, differences in complication, case-fatality and mortality rates were examined based on ICU utilization.  Models were adjusted for patient factors, tumor characteristics and clustering within hospitals.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 40% of patients were triaged directly to an ICU following major cancer resection. Relatively few patients were transferred to ICUs after POD 0, with rates of 4.4% in LMHs and 3.8% in HMHs (p=0.27). HMHs admitted 45.7% of patients directly to an ICU postoperatively, significantly more than 32.6% at LMHs (p&lt;0.01).  HMHs directly admitted 76.6% of patients with an ASA status of 4 or 5, 60.3% of patients with ischemic heart disease and over 80% of patients undergoing lung, esophagus and pancreas resections to an ICU.  After risk-adjustment, the complication rate for HMH ICU direct admits was 31.4% (95%CI, 24.4-38.6%), not significantly different from 25.6% (95%CI, 20.1-30.5%) in LMH direct ICU admits. Conversely, the risk-adjusted case-fatality rate was significantly higher for HMH direct ICU admits compared to those in LMHs, 32.8% (95%CI, 24.5-41.2%) versus 13.8% (95%CI, 8.0-19.5%), respectively. Similarly, risk-adjusted overall mortality for ICU direct admits was significantly higher in HMHs than LMHs, 12.6% (95%CI, 10.1-15.1%) compared to 4.8% (95%CI, 3.2-6.4%), respectively. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Preemptive ICU admission does not assure better outcomes for high risk cancer patients. Despite utilizing critical care resources at substantially higher rates for high risk patients compared to LMHs, HMHs experienced significantly higher case-fatality and overall mortality rates. Understanding the processes and structural aspects of ICU care administered to cancer patients may yield opportunities to improve the quality of cancer surgery.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is utilized in certain patients to optimize outcomes.  The objective of this study was to analyze trends in NAT utilization and compare short-term outcomes in patients receiving NAT and surgery to patients undergoing initial surgical management for clinical stage I &ndash; III pancreatic cancer.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Data Base (2003-2011), evaluating trends in utilization and short-term outcomes (30- and 90-day mortality and hospital length of stay) in pancreatic cancer patients.  Patients with clinical stages I-III adenocarcinoma and carcinoma of the pancreas who underwent surgery, both with and without NAT (chemotherapy, radiation, or both), were included.  Univariate statistics were used to compare characteristics of patients who underwent initial surgery versus NAT followed by surgery.  Logistic and linear regression models were used to model 30- and 90-day mortality and length of stay, respectively. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The analysis included 6,204 patients who underwent initial surgery and 10,245 patients who received NAT and surgery. Patients undergoing initial surgery tended to be older, female, covered by Medicare, and had lower staged disease.  Over the past decade, initial surgical management and multimodality NAT has steadily decreased.  Use of neoadjuvant radiation has remained relatively static with low rates of utility. Use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, however, has been rising steadily.  Mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were significantly higher for patients undergoing initial surgery compared to patients receiving NAT and surgery (9.3% vs. 0.5%, p&lt;0.0001, 17.8% vs. 2.0%, p&lt;0.0001, respectively).  After controlling for patient, disease and surgery characteristics, patients who received NAT had a 94% lower odds of mortality at 30 days (p &lt; 0.0001) and an 90% lower odds at 90 days (P&lt;0.0001).  Length of stay was significantly higher for patients undergoing initial surgery as compared to patients receiving NAT and surgery (13.4 days vs. 10.1 days, p&lt;0.0001). More advanced clinical stage disease, pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy also negatively impacted 30 and 90 day mortality as well as hospital length of stay. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The utilization of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been increasing steadily for the past decade, while initial surgical resection has been decreasing.  Use of multimodality NAT also appears to be decreasing. Neoadjuvant therapy does not appear to have any adverse effect on short-term outcomes, including 30- and 90-day mortality and hospital length of stay.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Patients typically present with eczematous changes of the nipple due to intraepidermal spread of tumor cells. While the traditional treatment of PD is total mastectomy, recent small studies have supported treatment with breast conservation (BC) followed by adjuvant radiation. In this study, we aim to identify the current presenting and management patterns of patients being treated with PD compared to non-PD breast cancer.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify stage 0 - III unilateral breast intraductal or lobular carcinoma female patients 18 &ndash; 90 years old who underwent surgery from 2010 to 2012. Patients with PD were compared to patients without PD across demographic disease, and treatment variables. All statistical analyses were two-sided t-tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for discrete variables.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 502,833 female patients in the database who had surgery in 2010 or later, 2708 PD patients and 284167 non-PD patients met inclusion criteria. PD was associated with underlying ductal carcinoma in situ in 24% and invasive cancer in 76% (78% intraductal and 22% lobular) of cases. Paget disease patients were younger, more likely to be African American, less educated and with lower income, possess government insurance plans (Medicare or Medicaid) and have more comorbidities than non-PD patients (all P &lt; 0.0001). Breast cancer patients presenting with PD were more likely to present at a higher stage, undergo chemotherapy, and start treatment later than non-PD patients (all P &lt; 0.0001). Breast cancers associated with PD were more likely to have lymphovascular invasion and test ER-, PR-, and Her2+. Only 23% of PD patients underwent BC compared with 58% of non-PD patients (p &lt; 0.0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: There are significant differences in the clinical presentation and local and systemic management of Paget disease of the breast and non-Paget disease in the United States, including disparities based on socioeconomic factors.

Assessment of a higher number of lymph nodes (LN) during curative resection has been shown to correlate with improved survival for many cancer types. We sought to examine the impact of the number of lymph nodes (LN) harvested during esophagectomy on esophageal cancer related outcomes. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: From a comprehensive esophageal cancer database we identified patients who underwent curative resection from 1994 to 2013. The impact of total lymph nodes (LN) retrieved on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was investigated. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In total, 635 patients were identified. Patients were divided on the basis of total number of lymph nodes removed (&lt;8, 9-12, 13-20, and &gt;20). There was no difference in the pretreatment distribution of tumor stages among the studied groups (p=0.23). The 5-year OS and DFS rates for the group by lymph node category were (43%, 42%, 55%, and 36%, p=0.18) and (44%, 37%, 46%, and 36%, p=0.52), respectively. Total number of lymph nodes assessed did not correlate with reduced risk of recurrence or improved survival. On multivariable analysis controlling for age, sex, histology, neoadjuvant therapy, only removal of 13-20 LNs correlated to improved oncological overall survival outcome (HR=0.65, p=0.04, CI=0.4-0.9) (Table 1.).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In a tertiary cancer center, we demonstrated that only removal of 13-20 lymph nodes during esophagectomy correlated to improved overall survival.

We sought to create a score to predict need for transfusion. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients in the 2010-2013 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program undergoing liver surgery were analyzed. Multivariable models were constructed to identify independent predictors of perioperative transfusion (&ge;1 unit PRBCs intraoperatively or within 72 hours postoperatively).  A scoring system to estimate odds of transfusion was constructed (n=16,679) and then validated (n=8,169). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 24,848 cases analyzed, median age was 60 years and 52% were female.  9001 patients (36%) had a major hepatectomy and 6100 (25%) received a transfusion.

Median age was 65 years, a majority were female (52.2%), white (84.5%), and had surgery (89.0%).  The most common primary site was colorectal (38.2%) followed by appendix (19.7%), small bowel (15.8%), pancreas (14.9%), and gastric (11.3%).  Median tumor size was 3.5 cm. The most frequent T classification was T3 (33.7%) followed by T4 (21.5%), T1 (16.4%), and T2 (9.0%).  Surgical resection was performed in 89% of patients and varied by site, more commonly for appendix (97.0%), colorectal (94.5%), and small bowel (88.7%) and less commonly for pancreatic (78.0%) and gastric (71.1%) (p&lt; 0.0001) primaries.  Nodal involvement was frequent (41.2%) and varied by site; pancreas (57.8%), colorectal (55.1%), small bowel (44.0%), appendix (27.4%), and gastric (24.2%) (p= 0.0002).

The aim of this study was to determine if CMCs detected with a semi-automated platform predict early relapse in stage IV melanoma patients.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Serial CMC assessments (7.5mL blood) were performed in patients with stage IV cutaneous melanoma (n=58) using the CellSearch<sup>&reg;</sup> system (Janssen Diagnostics). CD146+ cells were immunomagnetically enriched; CD146+, HMW-MAA+/, CD45-/, and CD34- nucleated cells were considered CMCs.  We correlated the identification of CMCs with tumor characteristics using chi-square or Fisher exact tests. Log-rank test and Cox regression analysis was applied to determine the association of circulating tumor cells with relapse-free survival. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was compared between patients with &ge;1 CMC detected at baseline (first blood draw) or at second blood draw (6 months after baseline) versus those with no CMCs at baseline and at the second blood draw.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: CMCs were identified in 28 of 58 (48%) patients at either baseline or at second blood draw.  We observed no significant association between CMC presence at baseline draw and primary tumor factors such as presenting Breslow thickness, number of mitotic figures, or ulceration (P=NS for all factors). Relapse occurred in 22 of 28 (79%) stage IV patients with &ge;1 CMC versus 12 of 30 (40%) with no CMCs at baseline and at second draw (log-rank P =0.02, HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.55; P=0.02).  No other primary tumor characteristic, including presenting Breslow thickness, number of mitotic figures, ulceration, or Braf status, predicted shortened relapse-free survival.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Using a semi-automated platform, CMCs detected at baseline or at a subsequent blood draw, predicted relapse in stage IV melanoma patients.

We sought to identify factors that are associated with such occult disease.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   The SHAVE trial is a prospective randomized controlled trial in which 235 women with stage 0-3 disease undergoing PM were randomized intraoperatively to either have routine cavity shave margins (CSM) taken at the time of initial surgery (n=119), or not (n=116).  The 76 women randomized to the 'shave' arm of the trial who had negative margins prior to randomization formed the cohort of interest for this analysis.  Patients who were found to have occult cancers in the CSM were compared to those with no further disease.  Non-parametric statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 21.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Of 76 patients with negative margins prior to randomization to the 'shave' group, 9 (11.8%) had occult cancers found in the CSM.  Six of these patients had occult DCIS, two had occult invasive disease, and one had both.  The median extent of DCIS and invasive cancer found in the CSM was 0.25 cm (range; 0.05 &ndash; 0.80 cm) and 0.30 cm (range; 0.17-0.30 cm), respectively.  Neither volume of tissue excised prior to CSM nor that of the CSMs was correlated with occult disease (p=0.52 and p=0.80, respectively).  Patient age, race, tumor size, grade, hormone receptor status, LVI, lymph node status, and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy similarly could not predict occult disease (all p&gt;0.05; see table for selected parameters).  However, the presence of invasive lobular cancer (ILC) trended towards association with the finding of occult disease in initially margin-negative patients (p=0.06). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Nearly 12% of patients with negative margins at PM will have occult disease; patients with ILC are more likely to have such occult disease.

Traditionally, sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) are identified preoperatively using 2-D planar lymphoscintigraphy;however, a new technique utilizing SPECT/CT may improve nodal detection rate in head and neck melanoma. Thepurpose of this study is to compare lymph node yield and nodal positivity rates utilizing SPECT/CT versus conventionallymphoscintigraphy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing SLN biopsy for cutaneousmelanoma of the head and neck between February 1998 and June 2015. Patient demographics, melanoma pathologicfeatures, number of SLN, and nodal positivity rates were compared in patients utilizing SPECT/CT versus conventionallymphoscintigraphy. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to identify factors associated with theidentification of a positive sentinel lymph node.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Two hundred seventy-eight patients underwent SLN biopsy: 201 underwent traditional lymphoscintigraphy and77 patients underwent SPECT/CT. There was no difference in gender (75% vs. 75% males; p=0.95), however theSPECT/CT group trended towards being older (57 vs. 53 years, p=0.05). The depth of primary lesion was similar in thetwo groups (2.1 vs. 2.1 mm; p=0.76) and incomplete data in the lymphoscitigraphy group limited the analysis onulceration and mitotic rate. The total number of SLN identified was greater in the SPECT/CT group (2.7 vs. 2.4;p=0.0292) and a positive SLN was identified more frequently in the SPECT/CT group (n=16, 20.8% vs. n=24, 8.6%;p=0.060). Age , gender, location of primary lesion, presence of ulceration, total number of lymph node harvested, andintraoperative technique utilized to identify SLN (radiocolloid with or without blue dye injection), were not associated withSLN positivity; however, depth of primary lesion (OR 1.40; p=0.002) and use of SPECT/CT (OR 2.75; p=0.023) weresignificantly associated with a positive SLN. The multivariable logistic regression model c-statistic was 0.72, indicating amoderate predictive value.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients with head and neck melanoma who undergo SPECT/CT have higher SLN yields. After controllingfor common factors associated with the presence of positive SLN, the use of SPECT/CT has 3-fold higher likelyhood ofidentifying a positive SLN compared to traditional lymphoscintigraphy. Long-term follow-up is needed to further define theimpact of SPECT/CT on recurrence and survival.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

The mechanisms whereby PDAC is able to metastasize are still poorly understood. A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAP) are a family of scaffolding proteins that mediate signal transduction and cellular localization of protein kinase A, an inducer of cell motility. AKAP12 is one member that has shown a role in a variety of highly-metastatic cancers including colon, melanoma, and prostate but its role in PDAC is undefined.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  AKAP12 expression was determined by immunoblot in both commercially available PDAC cell lines as well as from patient-derived PDAC tumors. The effect of AKAP12 knockdown with siRNA on cell proliferation and migration was determined by measurement of Alamar Blue reduction and transwell migration assay to culture media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, respectively. The AKT, ERK, and MEK pathways were interrogated by immunoblot to ascertain changes in signaling associated with abrogation of AKAP12 expression.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  A differential expression was noted between PDAC cell lines with a 19, 27, and 328-fold increase in expression of AKAP12 in BxPC3, L3.6pl, and Panc-1 cell lines compared to MiaPaCa. Additionally, a 17.6-fold increased mean expression of AKAP12 was noted in patient-derived PDAC samples compared to normal (p=0.05). While no statistical difference was seen in proliferation after AKAP12 knockdown, migration at 48hrs was significantly reduced by 95.5% (p=0.05) and 86.5% (p=0.02) in BxPC3 and Panc-1, respectively after AKAP12 siRNA knockdown compared to control (Figure 1). Finally, AKAP12 knockdown resulted in the 23-fold, 6-fold, and 4.5-fold increase in phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, and MEK proteins in Panc-1 cells, respectively and 34-fold, 56-fold, and 1.6-fold increase in BxPC-3, respectively.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:  AKAP12 is differentially expressed in human PDAC tissue samples and cell lines. Inhibition of AKAP12 results in decreased migration in vitro but no effect on proliferation. This may result in compensatory increases in the activation of the AKT and MEK-ERK pathways. AKAP12 may play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis but further studies are needed to clarify its role.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Incidence of postoperative complication is relatively high than that of other gastrointestinal tract surgery. Anastomotic leakage is one of the critical complications after esophagectomy. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment is essential. In our institute, we developed a new diagnostic procedure for postoperative anastomotic leakage using computed tomography examination (CT) at the 6<sup>th</sup> postoperative day after esophagectomy for esophagial cancer.?<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  From January 2012 to April 2015, 156 patients with esophageal cancer underwent curative resection under thoracolaparotomy in our institute. We made a comparative review of patient characteristics, surgical outcomes, and findings from the postoperative CT and the videofluorographic examination for swallowing (VF) of the 138 patients, which were reconstructed primary by the gastric tube (including salvage operation). Anastomotic leakage was defined as discharge of the digestive fluid from wounds or drains, which required medical and/or operative treatment (above grade 2 in Clavien - Dindo classification). Gastric tube stump leakage and anastomotic leakage were undifferentiated.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-four cases, 17% suffered Anastomotic leakage (AL (+) group), and 114 cases, 83% did not (AL (-) group). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics such as age, sex, stage of the disease, location of the tumor, and preoperative treatment such as endoscopic extraction and chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Surgical outcomes such as usage of laparoscope / thoracoscope, field of lymph node dissection, reconstruction route, anastomotic site, operative duration, and intraoperative blood loss were equivalent in both groups. Mean number of air-bubbles (larger than 2 mm in diameter) in the cervical division and the mediastinal space by the CT image was significantly higher in the AL (+) group (AL (+) group, 4.8; AL (-) group, 0.7; P&lt;0.001). When we decide 3 air-bubbles as a cutoff value (&quot;air - bubble sign&quot;), sensitivity and specificity of &quot;air - bubble sign&quot; against anastomotic leakage were 92% and 96%, respectively. In contrast, sensitivity and specificity of the postoperative VF against anastomotic leakage were 63% and 100%, respectively.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: &quot;Air-bubble sign&quot; in the postoperative CT has higher sensitivity?than VF for diagnosis of anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy. &quot;Air - bubble sign&quot; may be a substitute for VF.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Published data examining impact of MIDP on survival are limited to experiences from high-volume institutions. Our aims were to compare adjuvant chemotherapy use and overall survival between MIDP and open surgery (ODP).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Adult patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy for Stage I and II pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified from the National Cancer Data Base, 2010-2012. Univariate and multivariate regression and survival analysis were employed to examine the association between MIDP (laparoscopic or robotic) vs. ODP and use of adjuvant chemotherapy and oncologic outcomes.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1,807 patients underwent distal pancreatectomy for adenocarcinoma at 506 institutions: 505 (28%) MIDP, and 1,302 (72%) ODP. Use of MIDP from 2010 to 2012 increased from 131 (26%) to 209 (41%) cases. The majority of MIDP cases were performed at academic institutions (68%) compared to comprehensive community (30%) and community hospitals (2%). After adjustment, compared to patients who underwent ODP, those who underwent MIDP were more likely to have complete tumor resections [OR 1.53 (CI 1.09-2.17), p=0.02] and a shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) [-11%, (CI -5% to -16%), p=0.0002]. MIDP is associated on average with an 11% shorter LOS, which would be a reduction of about 1 day from the average ODP LOS of 10 days. The rates of 30-day readmission [OR 1.11 (0.72-1.72), p=0.62] and 30-day mortality [OR 0.83 (0.65-1.06), p=0.13] were similar between groups. Patients undergoing MIDP vs. ODP were more likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy [OR 1.26 (1.00-1.60), p=0.05]; time to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy was not different between groups [-2%, (CI -8% to 4%) p=0.45). Median follow-up was 17 months (IQR 10-26 months). In unadjusted analysis, 3-year survival was similar between MIDP and ODP (40% vs. 37%, p=0.42). After adjustment, overall survival for MIDP vs. ODP remained similar (HR 0.85, (CI 0.67-1.10) p=0.21). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Over the years, utilization of MIDP has increased, with the majority of procedures performed at academic institutions.

In addition, the recent development of high-powered microwave ablation (MWA) may offer potential benefits over cryoablation.  The objective of this study was to evaluate disease recurrence after treatment for patients with small RCC treated with ablation or surgery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A total of 489 patients were treated with percutaneous ablation or surgery for localized RCC (confirmed with biopsy or surgical pathology) at our institution from 2001-2015. Differences in patient and disease characteristics among patient cohorts were evaluated using t-test or chi squared analysis.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 489 patients, 314 (64.2%) were treated surgically, 100 (20.4%) were treated using MWA and 75 (15.3%) had cryoablation.  There was no difference in gender, race, body mass index, smoking history, R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score, laterality, tumor diameter, or histologic RCC subtype among ablative treatments or surgery (p=0.13, 0.08, 0.08, 0.18, 0.16, 0.29, 0.80, 0.3).Patients treated surgically were younger (p&lt;0.0001) with median age 56.9 (IQR 48-66) compared to MWA (median age 67.0 IQR 59-72) or cryoablation (median age 65, IQR 60-74). Patients treated surgically were also more likely to have symptoms at presentation (p=0.01) compared to ablative treatments and more likely to have higher nuclear grade compared to ablative treatments (0.0002). Median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2 (IQR 1-3) in surgically treated patients, compared to 3 (IQR 2-4) and 3 (IQR 2-4) in MWA and cryoablation respectively (p&lt;0.0001).Median follow-up was 9 months (IQR 6-18) for patients treated with MWA compared to 40 months (IQR 24-60) for cryoablation and 41 months (IQR 15-80) for surgery (p&lt;0.0001).Local recurrence was identified in 11(14.7%) patients following cryoablation compared to 1(1%) patients following MWA or 3(1%) after surgery, (p&lt;0.0001).  Development of metastatic RCC was observed in 2 (2.7%), 0 (0%), and 12 (3.8%) of patients following cryoablation, MWA or surgery respectively, (p=0.13).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Local recurrence is rare after surgery or percutaneous microwave ablation for small localized RCC.  Cryoablation is associated with higher rates of local recurrence and retreatment compared to surgery.

The reason for this is multifactorial, including delay in diagnosis, surgically unresectable disease, and high recurrence rates. Recurrence rates for retroperitoneal sarcomas have been reported as high as 70%. Complete surgical resection is the most important prognostic factor for prolonged survival.  Radiation therapy has been utilized to help achieve negative surgical margins and to potentially decrease rates of local recurrence. The study was to review the experience at a tertiary referral center specializing in the multidisciplinary care of treating patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas. The goal of the study was to determine if there was a difference in local recurrence rates or postoperative morbidity for patients treated with preoperative radiation therapy and surgery or for those treated with surgery alone.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Retrospective review of patients treated for retroperitoneal sarcomas at Fox Chase Cancer Center from 1997-2015, with IRB approval. Chi-square and Student t-tests were used to assess primary endpoints of recurrence and postoperative morbidity.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 73 patients identified with retroperitoneal sarcomas treated with preoperative radiation therapy and surgery (18patients) or surgery alone (55 patients). The median age was 60 years and there were more females than males, 55% versus 45% respectively. The predominant histologies were: liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Sixty-eight percent of patients had tumors greater than 10cm. There were more low-grade tumors in the surgery alone group and there were more high-grade tumors in the XRT/surgery group. However this was not statistically significant, p=0.17. Fifty-one percent of the patients developed recurrence. The surgery alone group had more local recurrences compared to the surgery/XRT group (36% versus 17%, p=0.014). Complication rate for the entire group was 35.6%. However, there was no difference in postoperative morbidity between the two groups. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The mainstay of treatment of patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas is surgery. However, with the high rates of local recurrence rates, the large size of the tumors, and involvement of adjacent organs radiation therapy is a viable adjunct to surgery. Our study demonstrated improved local recurrence rates with radiation therapy with no increase in morbidity.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Chagpar<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Yale University,Surgery,New Haven, CT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:   Recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that taking cavity shave margins in women undergoing partial mastectomy (PM) results in a halving of positive margin and re-excision rates.  We sought to determine whether taking a 'mini-shave', or a tiny sample of each margin, would similarly reduce the positive margin rate, while removing less tissue.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A retrospective cohort study was performed of patients undergoing PM with mini-shave excision of margins between October 21, 2011 and November 22, 2013.  Patient demographics and clinicopathologic tumor features were collected, along with margin status and volume of tissue excised from the primary PM specimen as well as the mini-shaves.  A positive margin was considered to be no tumor at ink for invasive cancer and tumor within &lt; 1 mm for DCIS.  Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 21 software.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  There were 121 patients in the cohort of interest.  The median patient age was 62.  21 (17.4%) had invasive cancer, 31 (25.6%) had DCIS, and 69 (57.0%) had both.  The median size of invasive cancer was 1.3 cm, and the median size of DCIS was 1.2 cm.  8 (6.6%) patients had invasive lobular cancer, and 3 (2.5%) had neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  The median volume of the initial PM specimen was 85.8 cm<sup>3</sup>, and 27 (22.3%) had initially positive margins. While the same number of patients (27, 22.3%) also had additional tissue removed intraoperatively prior to mini-shave excision, only 7 (25.9%) of these had positive margins on their PM specimen.  Selective excision of additional tissue did not significantly reduce the positive margin rate (22.3% to 19.8%, p=0.250 by McNemar test). All but one patient had mini-shaves taken from all six faces; the median total volume of mini-shaves excised per patient was 1.3 cm<sup>3</sup>.  The median ratio of mini-shave:PM surface area was 0.03.  The mini-shaves were negative in all but 4 patients, resulting in a reduction of the positive margin rate from 19.8% to 3.3%, p&lt;0.001.  Six patients underwent re-excision; three of whom had a mastectomy.  5 (83.3%), including the two who had negative mini-shaves, were found to have residual cancer.  All five had DCIS and one had invasive cancer; the median size of the residual disease was 1.6 cm. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Taking mini-shaves at the time of PM results in an 83% reduction in positive margin rates.  However, mini-shaves sample only 3% of the surface area of the initial cavity, and therefore may not accurately reflect the presence or absence of residual disease.  It is unclear whether this potential sampling error will affect recurrence rates, particularly in the current era of nearly ubiquitous adjuvant systemic and radiation therapy.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Univariate analysis was performed. Forward stepwise multivariate logistic regression controlling for patient demographics and stratified by age group was performed to determine the association between physician type/order with inappropriate care.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 6139 stage III colon cancer patients were identified. The cohort was 56% female, 83% white, 73% &lt;80 years of age. 69% of patients had &ge;3 comorbidities. 57% received chemotherapy and 5% underwent radiation. 47% did not receive appropriate GBT(2880), 90%(2596) of whom were undertreated. A surgeon was seen within the first 4 claims following the diagnosis for 64%(3924) of cases and an oncologist in 15%(947). Patients saw multiple physicians on the same date 18%(1100) of the time. On univariate analysis, seeing a surgeon(OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.07-1.32), oncologist(OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.06-1.40) or gastroenterologist(OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.00-1.24) was associated with an increased odds of appropriate GBT, however physician order did not make a difference.

Our aim was to compare outcomes between HALS and open colectomy and delineate predictive factors for selecting the HALS technique. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adult patients who underwent elective open or HALS colectomies from the 2012-2013 combined National Surgical Quality Improvement Program dataset were selected. Short-term perioperative outcomes were compared between 1:1 propensity-matched groups. A subset analysis was performed in those who received segmental colectomies only. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine predictors of utilizing either operative approach. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In total, 8,791 patients were included. 2,707 (30.8%) patients received planned open colectomies and 6,084 (69.2%) received HALS. Independent predictors of utilizing HALS include male sex (OR 1.17, p=0.006), increasing BMI (OR 1.01, p=0.02), a benign indication for surgery (OR 1.48, p&lt;0.001), and total abdominal colectomy compared to segmental (OR 10.39, p&lt;0.001), while younger age, black race, ASA class &gt;3, inflammatory bowel disease, and surgery requiring low pelvic anastomosis were predictive of open surgery (all p&lt;0.05). After matching for clinical, disease, and treatment factors, HALS was associated with lower rates of overall complications (13.6% vs 21.5%, p&lt;0.001), wound complications (8.8 vs 13.8%, p&lt;0.001), anastomotic leak (3.1% vs 4.7%, p=0.014), transfusion requirement (5.0% vs 10.7%, p&lt;0.001), postoperative ileus (8.8% vs 18.0%, p&lt;0.001), length of stay (median 4 vs 6 days, p&lt;0.001), and readmissions (6.9% vs 11.4%, p&lt;0.001), without requiring longer operative time (median 148 vs 150 minutes, p=0.111).

Patients undergoing index conventional pancreaticoduodenectomy carried the highest reoperation rate (6.2%) whereas enucleation carried the lowest (2.4%) (Table.) Longer mean operative duration also predicted need for reoperation. Patients who ultimately underwent reoperation were more likely to have experienced postoperative cardiac, respiratory, thromboembolic, and infectious events. The rate of transfusion-requirement was more than 2-fold among patients who subsequently required reoperation. 100% of reoperations occurred during the index hospitalization, and total length of stay was more than double in the reoperative group (Table.)<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Demographic characteristics, BMI, comorbid conditions, procedure type and duration, and postoperative events predict unplanned 30-day reoperation after pancreatectomy in the largest and most diverse sample to date.  These findings identify at-risk patients; further study is required to identify preoperative measures to mitigate the risk of reoperation.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Malafa<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Moffitt Cancer Center,Gastrointestinal Oncology,Tampa, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR, neutrophil count divided by lymphocyte count) is a marker for systemic inflammation and has been studied as a prognostic biomarker in numerous cancers. An NLR value greater than ~3-5 is associated with systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that changes to this ratio in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for borderline pancreatic carcinoma would be predictive of long term survival after resection.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All patients in our borderline resectable pancreatic carcinoma database (2006-13) were included if they completed neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, underwent resection, and complete data was available. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy usually consisted of gemcitabine, docetaxel, &amp; capecitabine while radiotherapy was usually 40 Gy with SBRT.  The difference in NLR was calculated as the NLR before surgery (after neoadjuvant therapy) minus the NLR before neoadjuvant therapy.  A clinically significant increase in NLR was defined as an increase by 2.5 or more units while any differences less than 2.5 units (including negative differences) were defined as stable NLR. Statistical significance was &alpha; = 0.05, survival was investigated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and uncertainties are standard deviations.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 58 patients were identified; all patients completed neoadjuvant therapy and 97% had R0 margins.  The mean age was 65 &plusmn; 9 years; 60% were male. The mean pre-neoadjuvant NLR was 3.1 &plusmn; 2.4 while the mean post-neoadjuvant/pre-surgical NLR was 4.4 &plusmn; 3.5. Overall survival was significantly worse in the increased NLR group compared to the stable NLR group (see figure, P = 0.009) with a Cox hazard ratio of 2.9 (P = 0.02). There were no significant differences in age, gender, tumor location, or Ca19-9 levels between the 2 groups.  Survival was not associated with adjuvant chemotherapy administration (P = 0.4) or AJCC tumor stage (P = 0.9), but N0 disease conferred a survival advantage over N1 disease (Cox hazard ratio = 3.0, P = 0.01). There was no association between changes in NLR and nodal stage (P = 0.8). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, both increased NLR and N1 disease remained independent predictors of worse survival (P &lt; 0.008 for both).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the first investigation demonstrating an independent, inverse association between survival and increase in NLR after neoadjuvant therapy followed by resection for patients with borderline resectable pancreatic carcinoma.  We theorize that a pro-inflammatory state is related to worse survival despite a high rate of R0 resections.  It is unclear if modulation of inflammation will improve survival in patients with pancreatic carcinoma, but we are actively investigating this in the laboratory.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Mounting data supports the oncologic safety of preservation of the nipple areola complex (NAC), and many presume quality of life (QOL) and other patient-centered outcomes are improved compared to skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM).  The predictive factors for selection of NSM by eligible women are largely unknown.    We sought to describe demographic, clinical and QOL characteristics of patients declining nipple preservation despite eligibility for NSM.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Women electing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and eligible for NSM were prospectively offered inclusion in an IRB-approved nipple sensation and body image/QOL cohort study. Eligibility criteria for NSM: unifocal, small (&lt;3cm) or no tumor (prophylaxis), tumor &gt;2cm from the nipple-areolar complex (NAC), clinically node negative, body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30, estimated breast weight &lt;700 grams, and no or grade 1 ptosis. After signing informed consent, the women self-selected the control arm (SSM) or investigational arm (NSM). Baseline nipple/skin sensation testing and body image/QOL questionnaires were obtained pre-operatively. Demographic, clinical, and QOL data were collected prospectively.  Descriptive and comparative statistics were performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:53 patients were enrolled; 38 (72%) patients selected NSM while 15 (28%) patients selected SSM without NAC preservation.  Patients declining NSM despite eligibility were younger (43 &plusmn; 10 versus 49 &plusmn; 10 years, p=0.05), had a higher BMI (26 &plusmn; 4 versus 23 &plusmn; 3, p=0.02) and were more likely to have an indication of prophylaxis (strong family history or confirmed genetic carrier) (53% versus 21%, p&lt;0.01).  Corresponding to increased BMI, patients declining NSM also had larger breasts by weight (564 v 364 grams, p&lt;0.001) as measured by gross pathology.  On baseline QOL evaluation, patients declining NAC preservation were less satisfied with preoperative nipple sensation, as well as the size and appearance of their breast and nipple; these differences were not statistically significant.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Not all women eligible for NSM select this approach.  Patient characteristics including age, BMI, satisfaction with the natural breast, and indication for mastectomy may predict patient preference and motivation with regards to preservation of the NAC during mastectomy.  Patient motivation and acceptance of future cancer risk may explain these differences.  Ongoing research regarding patient preferences may clarify decisions for NAC preservation and improve overall patient outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Although GBC is much less prevalent in North America compared to Asia, it is associated with extremely poor prognosis. This study examines a large cohort of GBC patients in the United States in an effort to define demographics, clinical and pathologic features impacting clinical outcomes in GBC patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Demographic and clinical data on 14,903 GBC patients was abstracted from the SEER database (1973&ndash;2012). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS&copy;v20.0 software using Chi-square test, paired t-test, multivariate analysis, and Kaplan-Meier functions.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 14,903 cases of GBC were abstracted with a mean age of 71 years. GBC was significant more common among Caucasian (65.3%) females (71.9%), p&lt;0.001. GBC was most often poorly or moderately differentiated (40.9% and 40.1%), p&lt;0.001). 37.6% of GBC cases presented with distant metastasis, p&lt;0.01. Surgery was the most common treatment modality for GBC patients (60.7%), p&lt;0.001. Combination surgery and radiation, which was utilized in 11.5% of GBC patients, achieved similar survival rates compared to surgery alone (3.637 vs. 3.435 years, p&lt;0.001). There was a significant increase in GBC incidence since 2000, with a rise in mean incidence of 1.8% between 1973 and 1999 period to 4.6% between 2000 and 2010, accompanying a rise in the mean incidence of surgical resection from 2.5% from1973 to 1999 to 5.0% from 2000 to 2010.

The incidence of GBC has doubled in the last decade concurrent with increases in cholecystectomy rates attributable in part to improved histopathological detection, as well as laparoscopic advances and enhanced endoscopic techniques. Surgical resection confers significant survival benefit in GBC patients, although a significant portion of GBC patients with regional disease remain untreated or undertreated. Given its rarity, all GBC patients should be enrolled in clinical trials or registries to optimize treatment and clinical outcomes for these patients.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Small, low risk tumors account for most of this increase. During this same period, the U.S. population continues to age with the average life expectancy of 79 years. In this study, we explored trends in the extent of treatment for DTC over the last 25 years, with a focus on the elderly.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This study is a retrospective analysis using the Survey Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Patients 20 years and older with thyroid cancer who underwent surgery from 1988 to 2012 were included. Cases were considered low risk if they were either classical papillary or follicular carcinoma, T1 (a or b) N0 M0 by TNM classification, and without extrathyroidal extension. Larger tumors, with unfavorable histology, nodal or distant metastases or extrathyroidal extension were considered high risk. We defined elderly as &ge; 70 years old. Trends in rates of total thyroidectomy (TT), radioactive iodine treatment (RAI) and lymph node dissection (LND) (removal of at least three lymph nodes) were analyzed and compared using chi square test, student&#39;s t-test, weighted least square linear regression and multivariate logistic regression where appropriate.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 131,590 cases of DTC met our inclusion criteria and 11.3% were elderly. Overall, rates of TT have increased since 1988 by an average of 0.4% annually. The rate of increase was greater in the elderly compared to the younger cohort (0.58 vs. 0.38%/year, p = 0.02). This disparity between the elderly and younger was most pronounced within the low risk group alone (0.66 vs 0.3%/year, p = 0.03). Through the entire study period, the elderly remained less likely to receive a TT than those under 70 when controlling for all patient and tumor features (OR = 0.66, p &lt; .001). Rates of RAI increased between 1988 and 2012 by 0.19%/year. Annual rates of RAI treatment averaged 12.4 % lower in the elderly than the younger cohort (p = 0.063). The elderly and younger patients experienced similar rates of increasing RAI treatment (p = 0.99). Annual rates of LND rose by 0.88%/year. Considering year of diagnosis alone, patients were much more likely to receive a LND in the most recent five years (2008 - 2012) compared to early years (OR 2.33, p &lt; 0.01). Overall, elderly patients were half as likely to receive LND as younger patients in our model (OR 0.52, p &lt; 0.01).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Treatment for DTC has become more aggressive over the last 20 years with increasing use of TT and LND. The elderly experienced this trend, but older age alone was not independently associated with more aggressive treatments. The overall increase in more extensive treatment for low risk tumors warrants improved risk adjusted treatment decisions.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

However, there currently is not a clear understanding about EUS utilization patterns and impact on management decisions, especially given that tissue diagnosis is not required prior to resection. Therefore, we set out to determine the extent of preoperative EUS use and the factors that increase the likelihood of EUS receipt for patient with resectable pancreatic cancer. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare-linked database to identify patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We included patients &ge;66yo with the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who underwent major pancreatic resection. The date of diagnosis was defined as the first staging procedure within the 6 months prior to surgery, with the staging period extending until the time of surgery. Univariate analysis compared demographic and clinical variables for those with EUS and those without. Logistic regression was used to determine factors most associated with preoperative EUS. The main outcome was EUS use in the staging period. Patient and disease factors associated with receipt of EUS were also identified. Secondary outcomes were number of staging tests, and time to surgery. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:2,782 patients were included, 55% female with an average age of 74.7&plusmn;5.5 years. 72% had regional disease (n=2002), and 56% were treated at an academic hospital (n=1563). Of all operations, 83.4% (2321/2782) had a proximal, total, or other pancreatectomy. 1204 patients underwent EUS (43.3%). On logistic regression the factors most strongly associated with receipt of EUS were: date of diagnosis, SEER area, a NCI or academic hospital, and a gastroenterologist as the first consultant (Table). Additionally, on multivariate regression, EUS was associated with mean increased time to surgery (17.79 days; p&lt;0.0001), and independently associated with an increased number of staging tests (40 tests per 100 patients; p&lt;0.0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:EUS is commonly used in the preoperative period, despite guidelines stating that tissue diagnosis is not required prior to surgery. Factors most associated with receipt of EUS are most strongly associated with geographic, temporal, and institutional factors, not clinical/disease factors. Additionally, patients with EUS had a longer time to surgery and an increase in the number of staging tests. This suggests that EUS may be overused in patients with resectable disease, with an increased cost and treatment delay without clearly adding clinical value.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Our objective was to identify a set of potentially actionable genes for nine cancers using a novel combination of systematic genomic analysis and published cancer microarray databases and to determine whether there exist overlapping actionable genes among these cancers.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A total of 12 gene expression microarray datasets containing 9 different solid cancer types (n=1016) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, including 104 breast cancer, 117 brain tumor, 36 colon cancer, 108 gastric cancer, 155 liver cancer, 72 pancreatic cancer, 72 renal cancer, 6 prostate cancer and 346 matching non-tumor control tissue samples. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to compute gene expression network and to determine the connectivity and significance of genes for each cancer type and whether there were common genes among the nine cancer types.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:WGCNA of a total of 1016 gene expression data revealed specific gene modules for each cancer type. Gene co-expression networks were constructed and actionable genes for the nine cancer types were identified. Importantly, one particular module contained differentially overexpressed genes across all nine cancer types versus their matching non-tumor controls. Of these, the actionable genes BIRC5, TPX2, CDK1, and MKI67, well-known cancer genes, were significantly enriched in cell cycle and cell proliferation pathways. In addition, a DEG-survival correlation matrix was constructed and resulted in a list of actionable genes that were significantly associated with the overall patient survival across these cancer types. Strikingly, the solute carrier family proteins SLC6A13, SLC13A1 and SLC5A12 mediating ion/glucose transport led the gene list, suggesting a strong correlation between ion/glucose transport and cancer patient survival.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The systematic genomic analysis utilizing a large collection of cancer gene expression microarray datasets and WGCNA reveals potentially actionable cancer genes unique for each cancer type. A shared gene module containing actionable genes common to the nine cancer types involving cell cycle and cell proliferation pathways was identified in support that cancer types may have a shared core molecular pathway. Specific gene modules for each type of the cancers may provide better understanding of molecular mechanisms for these cancers, and provide potential therapeutic targets for precision medicine.","Basic Science","Cancer Genetics","Oncology"

Cioffi<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Alpert Medical School Of Brown University, Rhode Island Hospital,Division Of Trauma And Surgical Critical Care, Department Of Surgery,Providence, RI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Although trauma is an illness that occurs in an acute fashion, often demanding immediate attention, significant numbers of trauma patients present to the hospital hours or days after their initial injury. Delays in presentation occur for a variety of reasons such as lack of awareness of the consequences of injury or limited access to healthcare. Such delays are often associated with increasingly complex disease patterns and management options. There has been little investigation into whether there are differences in trauma patients who present delayed compared to patients that present immediately after injury. We hypothesize that trauma patients who present delayed have different demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and may be at increased risk for worse outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a retrospective review of the trauma registry from 2010-2014 at a Level I trauma center. Patients admitted to the trauma service were categorized as delayed if they presented greater than 24 hours after their initial injury. All patients admitted to the trauma service within 24 hours of their initial injury served as the control group. Charts were reviewed for demographics, mechanism of injury, comorbidities, hospital course and complications and outcomes. Continuous data was analyzed with Student's t test and categorical data with Chi squared technique.   <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the five-year period, 11,705 patients were admitted of whom 588 patients (5%) presented greater than 24 hours after their initial injury. Patients in the delayed presentation group were older (65 vs. 55 years, p&lt;0.001) and more likely to have psychiatric (33% vs. 24%, p = 0.0001) or endocrine comorbidities (27% vs. 23%, p = 0.04) than the control group. ISS in the delayed group was slightly lower (9 vs 10, p=0.003). In the delayed group, the average presenting time was 4.9 days after injury and there were a higher percentage of burns (7.1% vs. 2.8%, p&lt;0.001) and falls (76.4% vs. 49.3%, p&lt;0.001). Patients in the delayed group had shorter ICU length of stay (1.29 vs. 1.79 days, p = 0.03) but were more likely to suffer from alcohol withdrawal during their hospital stay (8.9% vs. 4.1%, p&lt;0.001). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Trauma patients who presented to the hospital in a delayed fashion after their initial injury were older and had different patterns of injury with more burns and falls. They also had more psychiatric comorbidities and were more likely to suffer negative outcomes such as alcohol withdrawal. It is important to identify these patients so they can receive more timely and focused care as it pertains to prevention of alcohol withdrawal. Future goals will include exploring strategies for early intervention, such as automatic alcohol withdrawal monitoring and social work referral for all patients who present in a delayed fashion.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

These medications can potentiate bleeding complications associated with trauma; identification of chemical coagulopathy in trauma patients is important to guide initial resuscitation.We previously conducted a retrospective review demonstrating the failure of the Platelet Function Assay (PFA)-100 to reliably detect aspirin and clopidogrel in traumatic brain injuries and cerebrovascular accidents. The overall sensitivity of the PFA-100 was 48.6% with a specificity of 74.8%.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of thromboelastography with platelet mapping (TEG-PM) as an alternative to the PFA-100 in identifying antiplatelet medications in trauma patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All TEG-PM studies from September 2013-2014 were collected. Admission diagnoses and home antiplatelet medications were reviewed. Trauma patients were selected and evaluated for concurrent PFA-100 tests to allow direct comparison of the two studies.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 256 TEG-PM studies were performed. 106 were trauma patients and constituted our research group. Both TEG-PM and PFA-100 studies were performed on 21 patients.TEG-PM identified aspirin with an overall sensitivity of 73.1% and specificity of 37%; clopidogrel was detected with 100% sensitivity and 12.7% specificity.In the 21 patients who had both a TEG-PM and PFA-100, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the PFA-100 was 50% and 61.9%, respectively. Individually, the sensitivity of the PFA for ADP inhibition was 33.3%. There was 100% sensitivity and 8.3% specificity of the TEG-PM for ADP inhibition. Overall sensitivity and specificity for the TEG-PM was 94.4% and 25%, respectively.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PFA-100 was similar to our previous study. TEG-PM was more sensitive for detecting clopidogrel than the PFA-100 in the same set of patients.The high sensitivity of TEG-PM for detecting clopidogrel was also seen in the larger trauma group. A 100% negative predictive value of the TEG-PM for ADP inhibition is key and indicates its possible role as a screening tool for antiplatelet medications in the initial evaluation of trauma patients.Interestingly, there is a low specificity of the TEG-PM for ADP inhibition &ndash; high levels of ADP inhibition are seen in trauma patients despite no known antiplatelet medication use.  Acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) is a known phenomenon. The etiology of this inhibition is unclear; however, coagulopathy in the trauma patient remains an independent predictor of death and warrants further investigation.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

We investigated for the presence of racial disparities in a cohort of adult trauma patients with TRICARE coverage (military health system insurance).  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We identified patients (age &ge;18), including uniformed service personnel, dependents and retirees, who were treated in the United States for non-combat index injuries between 2006 and 2010.  Included patients had a primary diagnosis of traumatic injury (ICD-9 800-959.9) and an Injury Severity Score (ISS) &ge;9.  Patients with superficial injuries, foreign body injuries and late effects were excluded.  Patient demographics as well as clinical and hospital characteristics were compared by race.  Multilevel logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounding and accounting for clustering of patients within hospitals, determined whether race is an independent predictor of mortality, major morbidity or readmission following traumatic injury among patients with universal insurance coverage.  Interaction between trauma outcomes by race and hospital type (civilian or military) was tested.     <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Identified trauma patients (N=19,024) were young (58% of patients age &lt;35), predominantly male (76%) and healthy (89% of patients had Charlson Comorbidity Index = 0); 77% were White, 13% Black and 5% Asian/Pacific Islander. The remaining 5% identified with other races.  The largest proportion of patients was active duty or guard (64%) and received care at a civilian hospital (63%). Compared to White patients, minority patients admitted for primary trauma did not experience worse outcomes with respect to morbidity, mortality or readmission.  Some groups experienced better outcomes than White patients: Asians/Pacific Islanders had significantly lower odds ratios of 90+ day morbidity and 30+ day readmission, while patients of minority races other than Black and Asian/Pacific Islander experienced lower mortality at 90 and 180 days.  There was no significant interaction between race and hospital type (civilian versus military).  Risk-adjusted regression results are presented in Table 1.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Universal military insurance coverage was associated with resolution of racial disparities in morbidity, mortality and readmission after traumatic injury.  While unmeasured confounders, including socioeconomic status, may limit direct comparison with an injured civilian population, these findings highlight a role for universal insurance coverage for traumatic injury to mitigate known racial disparities in outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Triage guidelines target TRT activation to those patients who are at high risk of severe injury. Ground level fall (GLF) is the most common mechanism associated with injury related hospital discharges. Although GLF is a low energy transfer mechanism, patients often present with physiologic findings that trigger TRT activation. The purpose of this study was to measure the need for life saving interventions in patients presenting after ground level falls. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We queried our institutional trauma registry for all patients presenting after ground level fall from 2012-2014. Records were reviewed to determine the number of life saving interventions that occurred during the initial treatment phase. Life saving interventions were defined as CPR, intubation, chest tube placement, central line placement, packed red blood cell transfusion and transfer directly to the OR. Patients were grouped according to TRT Activation (full), Alert (partial), consult or none. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We identified 1398 patients who suffered ground level falls. Only 0.1% of patients underwent CPR in the ER. Intubation was required in 4.2% of all patients. Of the 59 patients that required intubation, 36 were intubated in the pre-hospital setting. Other life saving interventions included chest tube placement in 0.5% of patients, central line placement in 0.8% of patients, packed red blood cell transfusion in 1.1% of patients and transfer directly to the OR in 5.4% of patients.Of those who were transferred directly to the OR, 12 required decompressive craniotomies. Operative fixation of fractures occurred in 55 patients. Laminectomy with fusion was required in 2 patients. Ophthalmic injuries necessitating operative intervention occurred in 7 patients. No patients required a trauma laparotomy.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The main value of a trauma team is to perform life saving interventions and to approach the injured patient in an organized fashion. Patients who suffer from ground level falls rarely require life saving interventions. Trauma triage is a dynamic process. In a setting where patients can be rapidly evaluated and their triage upgraded at any time, the best use of resources may be to forgo pre-hospital trauma team activation for the ground level falls.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

However, the reasons for these disparities are not fully understood. 'Failure to rescue' (FTR) is an indirect measure of the effectiveness with which providers respond to patients that develop a major adverse event (MAE) while in hospital. This study explored whether there are racial and/or insurance disparities in FTR following injury. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients admitted to hospital in California (2007-2011) with a primary injury diagnosis (ICD-9-CM 800-957) were identified from the California State Inpatient Database (SID). The SID provides a comprehensive population cohort inclusive of 98% of hospital admissions. Patients who developed a MAE (myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, pneumonia, or post-operative hemorrhage) were identified and used to define an 'at-risk' denominator group. Patients with a MAE who subsequently died comprised the numerator and were used to calculate FTR rates for categories based on race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic) and primary payer status (privately insured, public insurance, uninsured). Multivariable logistic regression compared potential risk-adjusted differences in the odds of MAE and FTR, accounting for potential confounding associated with differences in patient- and hospital-level factors (Table 1). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 744,584 trauma admissions were identified; 73,885 (9.9%) developed a MAE and 4,860 died, giving an overall FTR rate of 6.6%. Multivariable logistic regression found a lack of significant racial/ethnic differences in MAE and FTR (Table 1). The only significant difference was a protective effect reported in Hispanic relative to White patients (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.93). Differences in MAE by payer status were only significant for publicly- (including Medicare) versus privately-insured patients. However, among patients with a MAE, differences in FTR were profound. Uninsured patients with a MAE had 59% higher odds of death (95% CI 1.25-2.02) relative to privately-insured patients &ndash; 28% for publically-insured patients (95% CI 1.14-1.44). These findings persisted for sub-group analyses using Injury Severity Score (ISS) thresholds of &gt;9 and &gt;15. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:FTR is a mechanism that could partially explain worse outcomes for trauma patients without private insurance. This study did not find any evidence of disparities in rates of FTR for historically disadvantaged racial/ethnic groups.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Although few sharks are considered dangerous, attacks on humans can result in large soft tissue defects; necessitating the early intervention of reconstructive surgeons. This study aims to determine the characteristics of shark related injuries so that they may be better treated. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The Global Shark Accident File, maintained by the Shark Research Institute (Princeton, NJ) is a compilation of all known worldwide shark attacks. Database records since 1900 were evaluated to identify differences between fatal and non-fatal attacks. Characteristics evaluated for both fatal and non-fatal attacks included: victim age, victim gender, geographic location of attack, anatomic injury pattern, shark species, and the victim's activity at the time of attack. The T-test and Chi-Squared tests were used to analyze the data for significant features between the groups.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Since 1900 there have been 5034 shark attacks, with 1205 (24.0%) fatal attacks and 3829 (76.0%) non-fatal attacks documented. While the number of reported attacks per decade has increased, the percentage of attacks that were fatal has decreased. Bites to the legs (41.8%) or arms (18.4%) were most common, with limb loss occurring in 7% of attacks and no injuries in 14.2% of incidents. Characteristics of fatal attacks included swimming (p = 0.001), boating (p = 0.001), three or more anatomical bite sites (p = 0.03), limb loss (p = 0.001), bites to the torso (p = 0.05) or Tiger shark attack (p = 0.002). Non-fatal attacks tended to be associated with fishing (p = 0.001), surfing (p = 0.001), only one anatomical bite site (p = 0.001), bites to the hands or arms (p = 0.001) and bites to the legs (p = 0.001). Geographically, the majority of attacks occurred in North America (1847; 36.7%), followed by Australia (1335; 26.5%) and Africa (676; 13.4%). Within the United States, the individual states with the highest number of attacks were Florida (896; 49.1%), California (248; 13.6%) and Hawaii (240, 13.2%).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although rare, shark attacks cause devastating injuries to patients. These injuries often involve multiple bite sites and limb loss which can create significant challenges for surgeons by limiting the available reconstructive options. A proper evaluation of the characteristics of the attack can lead to the development of optimal, well-coordinated care plans and improved patient outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

The purpose of this study is to determine if delay in VTE prophylaxis initiation in neurosurgical trauma patients is associated with an increased incidence of VTE.  Furthermore, we seek to identify the appropriate timing of initiation in various subgroups of VTEs as to prevent VTE development and not worsen the initial injury.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: With permission from our institutional review board, we performed a retrospective review of patients enrolled in Memorial's TQIP database from 2010 to 2014.  We included patients who sustained any traumatic brain or spinal cord injury (SCI), who were placed on chemical VTE prophylaxis.  Our data points included date of arrival, date of initiation of chemical VTE prophylaxis, and presence or absence of VTE development. We stratified the patients into injury groups: subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), subdural hemorrhage (SDH), a combination of SAH/SDH together, any other brain hemorrhage (BH), concussions, and SCI.  We compared all injury groups, then subdivided them into VTE and non-VTE development groups.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of all the 2,062 neurosurgical trauma patients, 142 had SAH, 155 had SDH, 160 had SAH/SDH combinations, 91 had BHs, 1,497 had some form of isolated SCI, and 17 had only concussions.  When all injuries were stratified, we found that the SAH/SDH group was started on prophylaxis significantly later at 8.3 days (&plusmn;6.2) than SAH (p&lt;0.01), SDH (p&lt;0.01), BH (p&lt;0.01), and SCI (p&lt;0.01).  Furthermore, isolated SCIs were all started on prophylaxis significantly earlier at 3.2 days (&plusmn;4.3) compared to SAH (p&lt;0.01), SDH (p&lt;0.01) and BHs (p&lt;0.01).The overall time to initiation of chemical prophylaxis in the non-VTE group was 4.0 days (&plusmn;4.8) compared to 6.2 days (&plusmn;4.7) in the group that did develop VTEs (p&lt;0.01).  When further broken down by type of neurosurgical injury, there was also a significant delay in initiation of prophylaxis in the VTE subgroups SAH/SDH (p&lt;0.01) and BHs (p&lt;0.01) with and without SCI.In the subgroups that developed VTEs, the SCI subgroup was started on chemical prophylaxis at 3.82 days (&plusmn;2.74), which was significantly earlier than the SAH (p&lt;0.01), SDH (p&lt;0.01), SAH/SDH (p&lt;0.01), and BH subgroups.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study suggests that VTEs in patients with traumatic brain injuries correlate with an increase in time to initation of chemical prophylaxis.  Specifically, SDH/SAH combinations are started significantly later than any other injury and carried the highest rate of VTE events.  Future studies will investigate the relationship between the time to initation of chemical prophyalxis and worsening of the neurosurgical injury to devise a formalized protocol for management.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

With or without a pre-operative diagnosis, abdominal exploration is often performed despite the subjectively high incidence of morbidity and mortality.  We hypothesis that: 1) abdominal exploration for patients in extremis leads to an inordinately high mortality and thus may be inefficacious, and 2) common physiologic measures at laparotomy predict mortality. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   All patients undergoing laparotomy while in extremis by the Acute Care Surgery (ACS) service at a mature academic medical center during a 4-year period were reviewed.  Surgery in extremis was defined by American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 4 or 5 or if surgery was a bedside laparotomy (BSL) in an ICU.  Outcomes were stratified by patient demographics, primary service, surgical findings, physiology at operation, and mortality. Comparisons were by made using the Chi Squared and Students t-test as appropriate. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  144 patients had surgery performed in extremis (45 BSL and 99 in the operating room (OR)). Overall mortality was 55.6% (77.8% for BSL and 45.5% for OR, p&lt;0.001).  Primary services and mortality rates included cardiac [71.4% (n=42)], medicine [70.0% (n=30)], ACS [42% (n=50)], and other [36.4% (n=22)].  At laparotomy, significant differences in survival were noted for Lactate level (2.7 vs. 8.5mmol/L, p&lt;0.001), vasopressor use (62.5% vs. 97.5%, p&lt; 0.001), acute kidney injury (51.6% vs. 72.5%, p&lt;0.01), leukocytosis (53.1% vs. 71.3%, p&lt;0.04), and anemia (45.3% vs. 71.3%, p&lt;0.01).  Operative findings at BSL revealed a mortality rate of 53.3% without identified abdominal pathology and 90% with any pathology (p&lt;0.01). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Therapeutic BSL has an extremely high mortality rate and thus likely represents futile care.  OR procedures for patients in extremis also carries significant mortality that may be predicted by physiology at operation.  This data suggests that surgical consultation for patients in extremis should be scrutinized for efficacy prior to offering surgical intervention.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Conversely, little is known about how thermal injury augments the homeostasis of coagulation. To understand how clot strength is augmented after burn injury Rapid thromboelastography was performed post-injury in a cohort of thermally injured patients. This study aimed to assess whether burn patients exhibit changes in clot strength that could be associated with occult or gross coagulopathy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A prospective study of patients with burn injury who presented to a regional urban burn center was conducted. Patient demographics and injury characteristics were collected and RapidTEG&trade; was performed on blood samples on admission and at regular time points over a 21-day period while hospitalized. Parameters analyzed were R (time to initial clot formation), &alpha; angle (rate of clot amplification), and MA (maximum clot strength). Coagulopathy was defined as either hypocoagulable or hypercoagulable with at least one parameter outside of the normal range.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The TEG profile of 88 burn patients with a mean age of 41.7 and a mean TBSA of injury of 22.2% were studied. Of these patients, 82% demonstrated abnormal metrics, with an observed trend from a normal or hypocoagulable state, to a more hypercoagulable state occurring between 48 and 72 hours. To further analyze this transition, patients without TEG analysis for three time points beyond 72 hours post-injury (due to death, discharge or decline to further participate) were excluded and the remaining subset of 33 patients were examined. This subset of patients had a mean age of 43.6 and a slightly higher mean TBSA of 33%. Of these patients, 15% (n=5) had R metrics within the hypocoagulable range on admission while no patients had hypercoagulable metrics. When comparing early time points versus late time points, greater than 72 hours, 79% had a statistically significant change (p&lt;0.05) in parameters indicating a hypercoagulable state. This included all but two of the initially hypocoagulable subset of patients, one of which remained hypocoaguable throughout all time points. When stratified by injury severity 80% of the less than 10%TBSA (n=10), 86% of the 10-30%TBSA (n=14), 57% of the 31-50%TBSA (n=7), 100% of the 57-70%TBSA (n=1), and 100% of the greater than 70%TBSA (n=2) patients had significant changes in TEG parameters indicative of a hypercoagulable state. Initial fluid resuscitation and transfusions were explored for potential associations with the observed coagulopathy, but no significant correlations were identified.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:RapidTEG&trade; analysis demonstrates hypercoagulability in a time dependent fashion post burn injury. The clinical significance of this coagulopathy needs to be further explored and on going reseach efforts will be aimed at correlating these results with other functional and plasma assays to better understand coagulation after thermal injury.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

We hypothesized that, in an older adult population, the number of rib fractures was a predictor of worse outcomes independent of patient comorbidities and trauma burden.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of the prospectively collected American College of Surgeons' National Trauma Data Bank registry was performed for all patients 65 years of age and older who had sustained rib fractures between 2009 and 2012. Patients with accompanying sternal fractures, penetrating or burn mechanisms, and those with missing data on the number of rib fractures were excluded for a total study cohort of 67,695 patients. Data were collected for age, gender, injury severity score, mechanism of injury, comorbidities, number of rib fractures, hospital mortality, hospital and ICU lengths of stay (LOS), need for ICU care, need for ventilator support, and ventilator duration. Data were also collected for the occurrence of any complication, the occurrence of any pulmonary complication; as well as the occurrence individually of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and unplanned intubation. To account for International Classification of Diseases defined database coding, rib fracture data was modeled both as an ordinal variable with groups (1-2, 3-5, 6-7, 8+ fractures) and as an interval variable (one to seven). Bivariate analysis was performed with all candidate predictor and outcome pairs to identify significant factors (&alpha;&lt;0.1) to include in multivariate models. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then performed for all dichotomous outcomes and log-transformed multiple linear regression analysis was performed for all continuous outcomes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Eight or more rib fractures were independently associated with hospital mortality, ICU LOS, need for mechanical ventilation, ventilator duration, pulmonary complications, ARDS, and unplanned intubation (p&lt;0.001). Six or more rib fractures were independently associated with LOS, need for ICU care, overall complications, and pneumonia (p&lt;0.001). In a subset excluding patients with serious injuries (AIS&gt;2) in body regions other than the chest, six or more rib fractures were independently associated with all outcomes except for ventilator duration (p&lt;0.03). In this subset, every additional rib fracture increased LOS and the need for ICU care (p&lt;0.03).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In older adults, the number of rib fractures is a significant predictor of trauma outcomes independent of comorbidities and trauma burden. It is unclear whether rib fractures in isolation cause the outcomes measured or are an independent variable for injury severity.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

However, the magnitude of this mortality reduction at the national level remains largely unknown. Our objective was to determine a nationwide estimate of number of lives that could potentially be saved if high-mortality trauma centers improved their performance.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Adults with blunt/penetrating injuries included in the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample 2006-2010 were analyzed. Hospitals were classified as high, average or low-performers based on risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality using the standardized Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) benchmarking methodology. Generalized linear modeling, adjusting for demographics and injury severity characteristics, was then used to estimate the relative-risk of death for patients treated at high/average performing hospitals versus low-performing centers. Subsequently, weighted national estimates of preventable mortality were determined for each of the following; 1)Conservative model: low-performing hospitals improve to average-performing, 2)Intermediate model: low-performing hospitals improve to average and average improve to high-performing and 3)Best-case model: all hospitals improve to high-performing.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 9,992,202 trauma patients from 1771 hospitals were included. 151 (8.5%) hospitals were classified as high-performing, 1,506 (85.0%) as average and 114 (6.4%) as low-performing. For conservative and intermediate models, an estimated 4,323 and 16,697 trauma deaths, respectively, could be prevented annually. Additionally, if all hospitals were to deliver the highest quality of care, an estimated 19,686 lives could potentially be saved each year.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: If all trauma centers achieved outcomes similar to those at the highest-performing centers, nearly 100,000 lives could be saved over 5 years. These national estimates demonstrate the tremendous societal benefits associated with provisioning high quality of trauma care. Concerted efforts aimed at the standardization and implementation of high quality trauma care should therefore be a priority.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Demographics, clinical data, and volume of crystalloid received in the ED were collected. Patients who received &lt; 2L of crystalloids were categorized as low volume (LOW) while those who received &ge; 2L were considered high volume (HIGH). Mortality and outcomes were compared and multivariate regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors for mortality.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over the 10-year study period, 879 patients met inclusion criteria. Overall mortality was 12.9%. 743 (85%) were in the LOW cohort and 136 (15%) in the HIGH cohort. Gender and mean age were similar between the two groups. The HIGH cohort had lower mean admission SBP (125 vs. 138, p&lt;0.001), lower admission GCS (10 vs. 12, p&lt;0.001), higher head AIS (3.8 vs. 3.3, p&lt;0.001) and higher ISS (26 vs. 18, p&lt;0.001).

Cotton<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Health Science Center At Houston,Houston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Field use of tourniquets (TQ) in military medicine is regarded as an effective adjunct for preventing hemorrhage-related deaths from extremity trauma.  Application in the civilian setting, however, has been accepted sporadically due to the paucity of evidence supporting efficacy.  Subsequently, there have been no randomized, controlled trials assessing the efficacy of pre-hospital (PH) TQ application. Our urban EMS system has been training pre-hospital personnel to use TQ since 2009.  The purpose of this study was to assess whether PH TQ use in the civilian setting decreases death from hemorrhagic extremity trauma. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Following IRB approval, patients arriving to a level-1 trauma center between 01/2009 and 05/2013 with an extremity injury and a PH TQ applied were reviewed.  Control patients were obtained from the trauma registry prior to PH TQ implementation (01/2003 to 12/2008) and were eligible for matching if they had (1) Extremity Abbreviated Injury Severity (AIS) &ge; 2 and (2) OR exploration /control of extremity vascular injury or (3) death with extremity injury likely to have a vascular injury.  Patients were propensity-score matched by age, gender, body mass index, mechanism of injury, method of transport and race. Matching occurred via a 1:1 ratio, with caliper and no replacement.  Continuous data are presented as medians with 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> interquartile ranges. Categorical data are reported as proportions.  Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 110 patients had PH TQ placement. Of 6961 control patients with AIS Extremity &ge; 2, 380 fulfilled all criteria for matching.  Propensity matching yielded a sample size of 61 patients per group.  Cases and controls displayed predominate isolated extremity injury (ISS 9 (4, 16) vs. 9 (8,18); AIS Extremity 3 (2, 3) vs 3 (2, 3)). The rate of vascular repair was similar between the two groups (89% vs 80%, p=0.212).  Patients without a PH TQ had lower systolic blood pressure (109 mmHg (83, 135) vs 124 mmHg (93, 154) P &lt;0.05) and hemoglobin 11 g/dL (9, 13) vs 13 g/dL (11,14) p&lt;0.001) upon arrival.  Failure to apply a PH TQ was associated with an increase mortality (21% vs 5%, OR 5.2 95% CI 1.31-29.9, p &lt; 0.01). Similarly, there was a lower percentage of expected survivors in the patients that did not receive a PH TQ (31% vs 67%, p=0.001). Patients that did not receive a PH TQ had a higher resuscitation intensity (4.1 (1, 11.25) vs. 7.5 (3.4, 14.2) p&lt;0.05).   <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pre-hospital TQ application is associated with improved mortality from severe extremity injury in the civilian setting.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

To date, no studies have used nationally representative date to quantify the impact of barriers to trauma care on injury mortality in rural populations.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a retrospective analysis of 2006-2011 National Emergency Department Sample data to determine if mortality following traumatic injury differs across urban/rural classifications. Emergency department (ED) visits with ICD-9-CM codes for injuries (ICD-9-CM 800-959.9) as the primary or secondary diagnosis were included in these analyses, excluding superficial and foreign body injuries, late effects of injury, as well as records with missing urban/rural status or disposition from the ED (N=8,887,575). Mortality was defined as dying in the ED or in the hospital during the admission associated with the ED visit. Overall, 0.12% of ED encounters in the sample resulted in death (N=10,665) Odds of death were calculated using multiple logistic regression with patient residential urban/rural status, Injury Severity Score, comorbidities, trauma center designation, patient age, and patient gender as covariates. All analyses were performed using Stata 12.1.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Residents from rural communities were 25% (p = 0.002) more likely to die of traumatic injury than non-rural residents, when controlling for severity, comorbidities, trauma center designation, age, and gender. Rural residents treated at Level I trauma centers were 3.06 times (p &lt; 0.001) more likely to die of their injuries, compared to non-rural residents. Rural residents at Level II centers were 73% more likely to die (p = 0.002), and rural residents at Level IV centers were 13% more likely to die (p = 0.016), compared to non-rural residents. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between rural and non-rural residents with treated at Level III (p = 0.151).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: People living in rural communities are significantly more likely than non-rural residents to die following traumatic injury. This disparity is largest at Level I trauma centers decreases at lower level trauma centers. Distance and travel time to treatment likely play a significant role in injury outcomes for rural residents, but measures of distance and time generally not available for nationally representative data that also include measures or rural/urban residence. Future analyses should explore the interaction between time to treatment, level of care, and outcomes for rural residents.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Little has been published on this complex topic. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients from 2005-2013 at a Level 1 trauma center with vascular injury/repair were identified via a prospectively maintained registry. Patient data, injury type/severity, treatment and 30 day outcomes were obtained from the trauma registry and chart review. Adverse events (limb loss, major disability, death) were outcomes of interest. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify predictors of adverse events. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In all, 346 patients were included (median age 34, range 1- 93 years) Median injury severity score (ISS) was 10(1- 59). Endovascular repairs (n=52)increased from 0%(2005) to 32%(2013), and demonstrated equivalent outcomes to open approaches(p = 0.24). On multivariate analysis, higher ISS(p =0.001), increasing age (p=0.01) and lower extremity injuries (p=0.001) were associated with adverse outcomes across the entire series. Endovascular approaches were most commonly utilized in vascular injuries of the chest/abdomen (39 of 52, 75% of all endovascular procedures in the series,p&lt;0.001), older patients (p=0.003), blunt injury mechanism(p&lt;0.001), and patients with a higher ISS at presentation(p&lt;0.001). <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:In this large series, the use of endovascular procedures increased over time, and was associated with equivalent outcomes to open approaches, despite their higher usage in older patients, those with chest/abdominal injuries, and those with a higher ISS at presentation.

We, therefore, undertook a study with the Ohio Department of Public Safety (ODPS) to identify the contributing clinical and system-level factors affecting the four outcomes; overtriage, undertriage, mortality, and transfers.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All trauma and emergency medical services (EMS) data for 2008-2012 were obtained from the ODPS, which included 35,631 unique patient records. Overtriage (OT) rate was defined as the proportion of patients with ISS&le;15 transported to a Level I/II trauma center; undertriage (UT) referred to patients ISS&gt;15 transported to a non-trauma center. Statistical analysis was used to compare proportions of patients experiencing OT and UT, and subsequent mortality and transfers, across several factors where OT and transfers indicate resource utilization, and UT and mortality directly impact patient care.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:OT and UT rates were 43.03% and 3.06%, respectively. We confirm a previous finding that patient/family choice (41.24%) was the top reason for triage decisions; most appropriate closest facility (34.28%) and protocol (14.92%) followed. With increasing patient age triage decisions based on patient/family choice nearly doubled (from 26% to 51%), and OT and transfer rates decreased substantially. Interestingly, the UT rates remained fairly stable unlike a recent study suggesting an increase. The highest inter-facility transfers (21.83%; p&lt;0.05) were observed when the triage decision was based on the most appropriate closest facility, which likely resulted from resuscitating the patient at a nearby non-trauma center first before transferring them to a trauma facility. However, when triage decisions were based on protocol, the OT rates (46.5%; p&lt;0.05) and mortality rates (7.02%; p&lt;0.05) were among the highest (Table 1), the reasons for which were unclear.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This work addresses several concerns related to on-field trauma triage currently under review within the state of Ohio. The findings in this study serve as building blocks to further our understanding of reasons for high mortality and transfer rates in an effort to potentially develop a new on-field triage model.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Contrast-induced nephropathy risk increases in those with pre-existing renal dysfunction. Laboratory plasma creatinine levels are often available only after contrast administration for imaging. Stable patients with low-energy trauma mechanisms may benefit from an algorithm for pre-contrast hydration or reduction in contrast load. Rapid point-of-care (POC) creatinine measurements may minimize delays to imaging. The purpose of this study is to determine the potential clinical impact of a new POC creatinine device in the trauma setting.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Forty trauma patients were enrolled in a prospective observational study.  One drop of blood was used for creatinine determination on a POC device (StatSensor Creatinine, Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA).  POC creatinine results were compared to the laboratory.

Patients aged 14-89 with ICD-9 codes for one of six closed head injuries (Concussion, Cerebral Contusion, Cerebellar or Brainstem Contusion, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Subdural Hemorrhage, and Extradural Hemorrhage) were analyzed. Univariate logistic and linear regression was used to assess the effect of demographic and injury characteristics on each outcome variable. All significant predictors were included in the multivariate models for hospital length of stay, mortality, and discharge disposition.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The analytical sample consisted of 201,553 TBI patients, including 2.5% Asian, 12.0% Black, 10.1% Hispanic, 0.7% Native American, and 74.7% White patients. Of these, 9.0% had Medicaid, 25.2% had Medicare, 12.3% had other insurance, 37.9% were privately insured, and 15.6% were uninsured. Compared to White patients, Black and Hispanic patients were less likely to die in the hospital (Black OR=.792, p&lt;.001; Hispanic OR=.840, p=.002), had longer hospital lengths of stay (Black coeff=.451, p&lt;.001; Hispanic coeff=.249, p&lt;.001), and were less likely to be discharged to inpatient rehabilitation (Black OR=.885, p&lt;.001; Hispanic OR=.703, p&lt;.001).

Patients with Medicaid were more likely to die in the hospital (OR=1.166, p=.019), had longer lengths of stay (coeff=1.493, p&lt;.001), and were more likely to receive continuing care after discharge (OR=1.396, p&lt;.001) including inpatient rehabilitation (OR=1.141, p&lt;.001) than the Privately Insured.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Race/ethnicity and insurance status both significantly effect patient's outcomes after TBI, even after controlling for other demographic and injury characteristics. The strongest disparities can be seen for uninsured patients who are more likely to die in the hospital, less likely to receive any continuing care after discharge, particularly any inpatient rehabilitation, and have shorter lengths of stay than any other group.

Database-stratified, multilevel-logistic models assessed risk-adjusted differences in mortality, major morbidity, and extended LOS (&gt;75<sup>th</sup> percentile) for trauma patients overall and among cohorts restricted to TBI, pneumothorax/hemothorax, blunt splenic injury, and pelvic fractures. In an effort to test the similarity of conclusions among the most comparable groups of patients, differences in trauma outcomes were further compared between ED/inpatients in NTDB and NEDS using coarsened-exact matching techniques.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: ED/inpatient combined totals of 1,578,487 (NTDB), 539,200 (NIS), and 5,069,811 (NEDS) patients were extracted. Patient encounters in NTDB were predominately managed at high-volume (86.7% in the top two trauma volume quintiles), teaching (87.3%), L1-L2 trauma (62.2%) centers. Encounters in NIS and NEDS were more varied: 1.5% (effect dominated by ED presentations) and 31.9% high trauma volume, 62.5% and 33.4% teaching, and 18.0% L1-L2 (only reported in NEDS) centers. Differences in patient factors, while present, were less pronounced. Risk-adjusted regression demonstrated qualitatively similar conclusions for most variables albeit notably stronger associations related to lack of insurance, Black race, age, and ISS in NTDB. Associations with self-inflicted injury, severe head injury (AIS&gt;3), and teaching status were more pronounced in NIS and NEDS.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This methodological assessment of large trauma databases points to important differences underlying trauma populations used in outcomes research. While largely comparable for predictions related to demographic factors, discrepancies at the hospital level need to be carefully weighed. Researchers are encouraged to make use of the wealth of information provided by these large population resources while remaining cognizant of the generalizability and limitations of each.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

To evaluate the role of ICU admission in patients undergoing initial non-operative management of splenic injuries, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of prospectively-collected data from the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study. We hypothesized that ICU utilization would vary significantly among centers; that centers with higher-than-expected ICU utilization would have correspondingly lower mortality; and that patients admitted to the ICU would have lower risk-adjusted mortality than those admitted elsewhere.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Data from 2011-2014 for all 30 level I and II trauma centers in Pennsylvania were evaluated. Patients were excluded if they were age &lt;17; died or were discharged in the trauma bay; or had immediate abdominal operation or angiography. Centers with &ge;20 eligible patients were included. Patients transferred from the trauma bay were included at the destination center. ICU utilization was defined as ICU admission from the trauma bay or after an immediate operation. We used multivariable logistic regression to model ICU admission and mortality. We calculated observed-to-expected (O:E) center-level ICU utilization and mortality ratios with 95% confidence intervals and evaluated correlations between ICU utilization and mortality with Spearman's rho.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 2,048 patients at 26 trauma centers were included (median age 41; 90.1% white; 62.9% male). Overall, 67.3% were admitted to the ICU; 63.4% of patients with grade 1-2 splenic injuries and 78.1% of those with grade 3 and above. Median injury severity score (ISS) was 16 overall; 17 for ICU patients and 12 for non-ICU patients. The final regression model for ICU utilization incorporated patient characteristics, admission physiology, and injury characteristics (grade, mechanism, and presence of concomitant abdominal, thoracic or head injuries). Model fit was good (AUC 0.74). Risk-adjusted ICU utilization rates varied from 26.8% to 95.5%  among centers. Crude mortality was 4.5%; 5.8% in ICU patients and 1.9% in non-ICU patients. The final regression model for mortality incorporated surgical interventions along with the above factors, with excellent fit (AUC 0.95).  ICU admission was not associated with any significant difference in mortality (4.5% vs. 4.3%, p=0.893). Significant predictors of mortality included age, ISS, operation, and admission physiology. At the center level, there was no correlation between ICU utilization and mortality O:E ratios (r<sub>s</sub>= -0.09, p=0.6645 ) or rank order (r<sub>s</sub>=- 0.10, p=0.6311).<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Risk-adjusted ICU utilization rates for splenic trauma vary widely among trauma centers, but there is no clear relationship with mortality. Standardizing ICU admission criteria could improve resource utilization without increasing mortality.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Sepsis continues to be the leading cause of death in this population.  The consequences of cross-infection across patients by these organisms can be dire. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of a single pediatric burn institution&#39;s experience with MDR-GNB colonization and infection in children with burns was performed.  The definition of multiple drug resistance was set as resistance to three or more antimicrobial classes of medications.  The definition of pan drug resistance was set as resistance to all antimicrobial classes of medications except for colistimethate.  Data collected on patents by the infection control coordinator included demographics, burn clinical data, MDR-GNB speciation, source of positive culture, hospital length of stay, and survival.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:3,359 children were admitted from January 1994 to December 2013 for management of acute burns or open wounds to the single pediatric burn institution.  220 of the 3,359 patients (6.5%) had MDR-GNB identified in cultures collected from wounds, sputum, urine, or blood during their admission.  MDR-GNB incidence significantly increased over the 2 decade period of the study from 2.5% of admission in the first decade to 8.6% of admissions in the second decade. Demographics of the patients included an average age of 8.8 years (+/- 5.3 years) and an average burn size of 42.9% TBSA (+/- 22.8%).   MDR-GNB infections included bacteremia in 80 (36.4%) patients, invasive wound infection in 46 (20.9%) patients, pneumonia in 19 (8.6%) patients, and UTI in 46 (20.9%) patients.  The 3 most common bacterial species identified included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (116 total, 33 PAN), Acinetobacter baumannii (127 total, 41 PAN), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (84 total, 2 PAN).  14 patients died (6.4%) with the cause of death in all 14 children attributable to MDR-GNB sepsis.  Cross-contamination was suspected in 22 (10%) patients.  No statistically significant effect was noted on rates of graft loss or number of operations needed per patient. <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:Pediatric burn patients face the risk of MDR-GNB infections which can lead to life-threatening sepsis.  The incidence of MDR-GNB identification in this institution has increased over 2 decades.  This may be due to inappropriate common use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.  Fortunately, most MDR-GNB isolates were still susceptible to colistimethate.  Stringent infection control adherence is even more important than ever to prevent cross-contamination of MDR-GNB across patients.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

The purpose of this study was to compare the quality of life of injured patients engaging in compensation litigation to those not engaged in compensation litigation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients 18 and older admitted with an injury severity score of 10 or greater, but, without a traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury were prospectively followed for 1 year. A comprehensive survey was administered at baseline and at 1, 4, 6, and 12 months after injury. The survey included questions about litigation involvement and quality of life (RAND Short Form-36 (SF-36)). Those involved in litigation were compared to those not involved in litigation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:312 patients were recruited and followed for 1 year.

Reported risk factors for SLF include the amount of red blood cells (RBCs) transfused, but vary in their inclusion of damage control laparotomy (DCL) patients.  This report aims to determine risk factors associated with SLF that are available to the surgeon prior to the performance of anastomosis or stoma creation in patients undergoing both definitive laparotomy (DEF) and DCL.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review was performed of all patients &ge;16 years of age admitted between 1/1/2011 and 3/31/2015 who underwent colon resection during emergent trauma laparotomy &ndash; defined as ED directly to OR or ED to IR to OR. Data was obtained from an institutional trauma registry and patient medical records. Patients who had stoma formation or died in intestinal discontinuity were excluded.  On univariate analysis, patients undergoing DEF and DCL were analyzed separately comparing those who did and did not have SLF.  A multiple logistic regression model was then created use variables determined a priori (age, post-operative vasopressor use, and RBCs) and those found to be clinically and significantly different.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 19,506 patients were admitted during the study period, of which 871 underwent emergent laparotomy and 16% (142/871) had a colon resection. 29 had stoma placement and 6 died in intestinal discontinuity, leaving 107 patients having undergone anastomosis, 54 (50%) DEF and 53 (50%) DCL. In DEF group, 4 (7%) had SLF. Comparing those with and without SLF, no differences in demographics, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ED vital signs and resuscitation, or technique of anastomosis were seen.  The patients with SLF had a lower final OR BE (median -9, IQR [-9, -4] versus -3, IQR [-4, -2], p=0.03) and a higher rate of postoperative vasopressor use (50% versus 4%, p=0.02).  In the 53 DCL patients with an anastomosis, 8 (15%) patients had SLF.  Comparing those with and without SLF, there were no differences in demographics, ISS, ED vital signs and resuscitation, OR vital signs and resuscitation, or postoperative vasopressor use.  There was also no difference in indication for DCL, the use of intestinal discontinuity, or anastomotic technique.  After adjusting for age, post-operative vasopressor use, OR RBCs, arrival SBP, arrival BE, ISS, and intestinal discontinuity, increasing age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.12, p=0.03) and intestinal discontinuity (OR 8.29, 95% CI 1.30-52.76, p=0.03) were independently associated with SLF.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In patients undergoing definitive emergent trauma laparotomy with colectomy, SLF is an uncommon event, but appears associated with increased age and the degree of shock upon admission the OR.

It has been suggested that cerebral hypoperfusion might be one of the causes of coagulopathy. This study investigated the relationship between cerebral and somatic tissue oxygenation and hemostatic derangements in TBI patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and tissue oxygenation were simultaneously measured in 92 trauma patients with suspicion of TBI at ED admission. Overall, 52 patients were diagnosed with TBI (head AIS &ge; 3). The level of hypoperfusion was characterized by tissue hemoglobin oxygenation index (TOI) using noninvasive near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) located at the forehead (cerebral) or arm (somatic), base excess, and lactate. Coagulopathy was defined as an INR &gt;1.2 and/or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt;40 seconds and/or thrombocytopenia (&lt;120*10<sup>-9</sup>/L). Patients who used anticoagulant medication (vitamin K antagonists, clopidogrel and dabigatran) were excluded from the study. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Trauma patients with acute coagulopathy had a higher head-AIS level compared to trauma patients without coagulopathy [5 (4 to 5) vs. 4 (4 to 5); P=0.038]. TBI-patients with coagulopathy (42%) had significantly lower levels of fibrinogen [1.8 (1.1 to 2.3) vs. 2.8 (2.4 to 3.2) g/L; P&lt;0.001], and higher D-dimers [17.6 (9.0 to 67.1) vs. 6.4 (2.7 to 13.2) mg/L; P=0.032] compared to TBI-patients without coagulopathy. TBI patients with coagulopathy had more signs of tissue hypoperfusion as indicated by increased lactate levels [1.9 (1.1 to 3.2) vs. 1.2 (1.0 to 1.7) mmol/L; P=0.026] and base excess [-3.1 (-4.6 to -2.0) vs. -0.1 (-2.5 to 1.8) mmol/L; P&lt;0.001] than patients without coagulopathy. There was no difference in NIRS cerebral or somatic TOI between TBI patients with or without coagulopathy. However, we found an inverse relationship between NIRS cerebral TOI and fibrinolysis as measured by D-dimers (P=0.038), fibrinogen (P=0.041), and maximum lysis in the aptem ROTEM test (P=0.016). The presence of coagulopathy was associated with both an increased in-hospital mortality (47.6 vs. 6.9%; P=0.002) and one-year mortality (65 vs. 16%; P=0.002) compared to patients without coagulopathy.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the first study to investigate the relationship between hemostatic derangements and cerebral and somatic tissue oxygenation using NIRS in TBI patients. This study showed that TBI-related coagulopathy is more profound in patients with metabolic acidosis and increased lactate levels. While there was no difference in NIRS cerebral or somatic tissue oxygenation between patients with or without coagulopathy, we found an inverse relationship between NIRS tissue oxygenation levels and fibrinolysis.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Williams<sup>1</sup>, A. Eastman<sup>1</sup>, R. Sarode<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,Burn/Trauma/Critical Care,Dallas, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is a viscoelastic analyzer that identifies patient-specific coagulopathy thereby providing a patient directed transfusion strategy. In order to be effective, patients in hemorrhagic shock with associated coagulopathy need an expeditious return of ROTEM results as rapid correction of coagulopathy significantly improves patient outcomes.  Although often used at bedside, ROTEM can be used to guide transfusions from a centrally located lab while results are viewed in real time from remote locations. Benefits include hospital wide availability and multi-disciplinary use. However, potential pitfalls in using a centrally located ROTEM include increased sample delivery and processing times. We performed a time efficiency study to identify work elements that could be streamlined to determine if we could improve the speed at which viscoelastic results are returned from a centrally located viscoelastic analyzer (ROTEM) in trauma patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A time efficiency study to evaluate work elements required in central lab ROTEM analyses on trauma patients was performed. Elements included time from sample collection to lab arrival and time to initial display on remote viewing monitor. These were measured for all ROTEM studies during January 2015 to calculate standard time per element and normal time to view results. We then implemented protocol changes to shorten the duration of each work element and prospectively measured them over the subsequent 3 months.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 33 consecutive ROTEM studies performed during a 1 month period determined standard time per element and the normal time per study. The median time from sample collection to lab arrival was 11 min [8, 18]. Time from lab arrival to remote display of results was 10 min [6, 12.5]. The normal time per study was 22.9 min [18.7, 28]. 196 consecutive ROTEM studies were performed after protocol changes and there was no difference in the time from sample drawn to lab arrival, 9min [6.7, 13] p=0.11, but time from lab arrival to initial display was significantly reduced to 5.6 min [3, 7.8], p&lt;0.0001. Modifications in work-flow resulted in a reduction in normal time per study to 14.8 min [10.7, 20.1]; p&lt;0.0001.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Using a centrally located ROTEM to guide trauma transfusions requires optimized processes to obtain rapid return of results. We were able to modify performance and effectively shorten the standard time per work element resulting in a significant reduction in the normal time to view results. This study validates that a centrally located ROTEM can rapidly return results for any hospitalized patient with hemorrhagic shock.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Implicit in this terminology is that rescue is possible and death therefore represents a failure.  We sought to evaluate the relationship between preventability and FTR with the hypothesis that many deaths meeting the definition for FTR in trauma would be judged non-preventable by structured explicit review and expert panel consensus.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We merged registry data from 2009-2013 at an academic level I trauma center with the results of all adjudications from morality review panels for the same time period.  Explicit review of charts by the mortality panel included attention to the timing and appropriateness of care rendered. The preventability of each death was determined by consensus of panel of trauma surgeons as part of peer review.  FTR events were defined as deaths occurring after any registry-defined complication.  Characteristics of patients sustaining FTR events were compared between groups using chi-squared and Mann-Whitney test as appropriate.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1,339/12,295 (10.9%) of patients had a complication.  Of these, 146/1339 died, for a FTR rate of 10.9%.   Of FTR deaths, 118 (81%) were judged to be Non-Preventable (NP), 19 (13%) were judged Potentially Preventable (PP), and 9 (6%) were judged to be preventable (P) by peer review.   Deaths judged to be preventable were more likely to have occurred in patients sustaining penetrating trauma, those with high GCS component scores, and with higher predicted survival by TRISS methodology (Table 1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In the trauma setting, only 20% of deaths meeting the definition of failure to rescue were judged to be preventable or potentially preventable by mortality review panels.  The current definition of the FTR metric may not be a valid measurement of the quality of care in the trauma population and revision prior to use for benchmarking of care in this setting is warranted.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

We hypothesize that pre-injury variables contribute significantly to mortality after post-traumatic sepsis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Trauma Data Bank data sets for 2008-2010 were retrospectively examined. ICD-9 diagnostic codes 995.91 and 995.92 were used to identify subjects aged &ge; 16 with sepsis. Survivors were compared with non-survivors using demographic, injury-related, co-morbid, and other clinical variables. The primary outcome was mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to determine predictors of mortality.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1486 patients were included, with a mean age of 55, in a predominantly male population (72%).  Whites made up 60% and Blacks 17%. Mortality was 15% in those who had sepsis without organ dysfunction and increased to 38% in those with sepsis plus organ dysfunction.  There was no difference in Injury Severity Score, emergency room systolic BP, pulse rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, GCS, ICU days or ventilation days between survivors and non-survivors. Compared to survivors, non-survivors were older (62&plusmn;21 vs. 52&plusmn;21, p&lt;0.001), had a lower respiratory rate (16&plusmn;10 vs. 17&plusmn;10, p=0.045), more likely to be female (33% vs. 25%, p=0.002), transferred from another facility (32% vs. 26%, p=0.021), and had pre-injury bleeding disorder (41% vs. 25%, p&lt;0.001), congestive heart failure (40% vs. 26%, p&lt;0.001), DNR status (71% vs. 26%, p&lt;0.001), history of myocardial infarction (45% vs. 26%, p=0.002) or hypertension (30% vs. 25%, p=0.04).

Early identification of this subset of patients may improve care, especially for those who will require a massive transfusion (MT). Our hypothesis was that an elevated admission lactate predicts the need for MT in hemodynamically normal patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All trauma patients treated at our university-based urban trauma center over a 5 year period were reviewed. Inclusion criteria consisted of hemodynamically normal patients (systolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg and heart rate between 60-100 bpm) who had an admission lactate. Demographics and outcomes were analyzed using Chi square and unpaired t-tests, a receiver-operating curve (ROC) and univariate and multivariate regressions.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of 5951 hemodynamically normal trauma patients, 3468 (58%) had an admission lactate.

The most commonly severely injured regions (AIS&ge;3) in the OT group were chest (100%), head/neck (33.6%), and extremity (26.6%).  Hemothorax/pneumothorax or a combination thereof was present in 45.6%OT<sup>#</sup>, 54.1%CH and 0%IP<sup>*,^</sup> patients.

A chest tube was placed in 28.1% OT<sup>#</sup>, 23.0% CH, and 2.0% IP<sup>*,^</sup> patients; 1 IP likely had chest tube placement for presumed blood/air.  The most common major surgical procedure in the OT group was orthopedic at 32.0%.  Finally, 57.7% OT<sup>#</sup>, 84.4% CH, and 86.3% IP^ patients were discharged to home.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pulmonary contusions are not infrequent following blunt trauma, with a 13.0% incidence. They rarely (2.7%) occur in isolation; most frequently they are associated with rib fractures.  However, 45.4% of blunt multi-system trauma patients will have pulmonary contusions in the absence of rib fractures, as compared to only 18.8% of patients with isolated chest injuries. Further, the presence of a pulmonary contusion warrants an aggressive search for additional injuries; 98.6% of multi-trauma patients had major non-thoracic injuries.   The additional injuries will often require major surgical procedures, with orthopedic surgery being the most common. Pulmonary contusions in association with other injuries are associated with substantial mortality as well as morbidity, as measured by the need for ICU care, mechanical ventilation, and low discharge to home rate.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage with a clinical indication for antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant medication present a significant clinical dilemma, burdened by the task of weighing the potential risks of hemorrhage expansion against the risk of withholding antithrombotic therapy.  We speculate that specific types of intracranial hemorrhage may be more susceptible to hemorrhage expansion after post injury administration of antithrombotics.  In this study, we sought to determine the effect of subdural hemorrhage on the risk of hemorrhage expansion after administration of antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant medication.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Medical records of 1,626 trauma patients admitted with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage between March 1, 2008 and March 31, 2013 to an adult level 1 trauma center were retrospectively reviewed.  The pharmacy database was queried to determine which patients were administered anticoagulant (warfarin, therapeutic intravenous heparin, therapeutic weight based lovenox) or antiplatelet (clopidogrel, aspirin) medication during their hospitalization, leaving a sample of 97 patients that met inclusion criteria.  Patients presenting with subdural hemorrhage were compared to patients without subdural hemorrhage.  Demographic data, clinically significant expansion of hematoma (defined as the need to stop therapy due to worsening intracranial hemorrhage), post injury day of initiation, and mortality were analyzed.  P values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 97 patients met inclusion criteria with 55 patients in the subdural hemorrhage group and 42 in the other intracranial hemorrhage group.  There were no significant differences in age, gender, injury severity score, admission Glasgow coma score, or mean hospital day of antithrombotic administration between the 2 groups.  Patients with subdural hemorrhage did have a significantly higher rate of intracranial hemorrhage expansion (9.1% vs 0%, p=0.045).  There was no difference in overall hospital mortality between the 2 groups.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Incidence of intracranial hemorrhage expansion was higher in patients with subdural hemorrhage.  It may be prudent to use special caution when administering antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication in this group of patients after injury.  Further study could help better define which types of  intracranial hemorrhage are most susceptible to expansion after antithrombotic administration.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

They are anatomically related as forces on the mandible have the ability to damage the posterior portion of the ring, or the cervical spine. Recognition of CSI is critical in the management of mandibular fractures as manipulation of the neck during fracture fixation has the potential to cause spinal cord damage.  The current study was designed to identify risk factors associated with CSI in patients with mandibular fractures using the largest US trauma database.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   The National Trauma Databank (NTDB) 2007-2010 was reviewed for patients with the ICD-9 diagnosis code for mandibular fractures.  Due to anatomic differences, patients were divided into two groups: children (&lt;18 years) and adults (&ge;18 years).  In each age group, the association between demographics, mechanism of injury, and injury characteristics with CSI was evaluated using bivariate analysis and logistic regression.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 8,317 children (14%) and 50,711 adults (86%) were identified.  The rate of CSI in children was significantly lower than adults (3.5% vs 7.3%).  In both age groups, the most frequent type of mandibular fracture was comminuted fractures (35.4% and 34.5% of children and adults respectively) followed by symphyseal (18.1%, 15.7%), body (13.2%, 15.3%), and condylar (16.6%, 11.3%) fractures. Using logistic regression different predictors of CSI were determined for adults and children; however, increased age, lower Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), thoracic injury (OR= children: 2.5, adults: 2.3), and motor vehicle accident (OR=3.0 and 4.0) or firearm (OR=9.5 and 3.0) mechanisms were predictive of CSI in both groups.  In children, condylar (OR=0.5) or multiple mandibular (OR=0.7) fractures were inversely correlated with CSI.  In adults, female gender (OR=1.1), mandibular body fracture (OR=1.2), and concomitant upper extremity injury (OR=1.4) predicted higher probability of CSI; multiple mandibular fracture (OR=0.8), concomitant abdominopelvic injury (OR=0.9), and concomitant lower extremity injury (0.8) were inversely correlated with CSI.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  The results of this study demonstrate the demographics, mechanistic, and injury patterns most significantly associated with CSI in the adult and pediatric populations.  Increased age, lower GCS, thoracic injury, and MVA or firearm mechanisms were associated with CSI in both groups.  In adults, CSI was associated with female gender, mandibular body fracture, and concomitant upper extremity injury.  The inverse correlation between multiple mandibular fracture with CSI could indicate that in multiple fractures the energy gets dissipated in the mandible instead of getting transmitted into the cervical spine. In order to prevent morbidity from CSI, these factors should be considered while evaluating patients with mandibular fractures.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Patients with complete parameters for calculating the MELD score were included, while those with pre-existing liver disease were excluded. Subjects were stratified into 3 groups: MELD I (MELD score &le;10), MELD II (MELD score &gt;10 and &le;20) and MELD III (MELD score &gt;20). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between mortality and the MELD score. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 183 patients were included, with a mean age of 43 years, and males making 68% of the study group. The mean MELD score and in-hospital mortality of the study cohort were 12.5 &plusmn; 5.9 and 18.0%, respectively. MELD I had a mortality of 9.4%, with 6.3% and15.6% of them developing abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respectively.

Unfortunately there is no true consensus on the best way to treat patients who suffer from severe TBIs.  Following brain tissue oxygenation (PtbO2) using special monitors (Licox) has been espoused as beneficial and our center has followed an existing guideline for the last seven years involving close ICP monitoring and in specific patients (chosen by the neurosurgeon) directed therapies to keep PbtO2 greater than 20. We sought to determine if the addition of PbtO2 improved outcome over standard ICP monitoring.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: With IRB approval, a retrospective chart review of the trauma database at a Level 1 center was performed of TBI since 2009.  We compared the outcomes of those with had ICP Monitors ('bolts' or ventriculostomies) and Licox monitors. We specifically looked at ICU stay, time on the ventilator, length of stay, Injury Severity Scores, and deaths employing T testing and Chi squared analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We found 150 patients meeting inclusion criteria: the Licox group had 41 patients, with an average age of 32, LOS 32.3, ICU days 18.75, vent days 15.9, ISS of 32.6 and 15 deaths. The ICP group had 109 patients, average age of 35.2, LOS 22.3, ICU days 14.8, ISS of 34.5, and 48 deaths. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to Age, ICU and Vent days, ISS. There was a difference in the total length of stay; with the ICP group have a shorter LOS. Using Chi-square testing, there was no difference in deaths between groups. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We found that in our current mature treatment schema for TBI, Licox monitors did not improve outcome, but did extend length of stay. Because the Licox paradigm involves aggressive and prolonged mechanical ventilation and frequent transfusion, both known to adversely affect injured patients outcomes, we feel unless its value is validated prospectively, it should be used sparingly.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

The use of continuous electroencephalography monitoring (cEEG) in TBI patients allows for potential identification and subsequent treatment of seizures that may otherwise occur undetected. The benefits of 'routine' cEEG after TBI remains controversial. This test is time consuming, utilizes a significant amount of resources and is expensive. To evaluate the benefit of cEEG, we examined the rate of clinical and subclinical seizures identified by cEEG in a cohort of moderate to severe TBI patients admitted to a Level I urban trauma center.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We analyzed a cohort of trauma patients with moderate to severe TBI (head AIS &ge; 3) who received cEEG within 7 days of admission at our Level I trauma center between October 2011 and May 2015.

Most were male (74%) with a mean age of 55.1 &plusmn; 23.5 years. Subclinical seizures were identified by cEEG in only 4 (3.8%) of these patients. Of all patients, 93% were on anti-seizure prophylaxis at the time of cEEG.

Potential mechanisms include decreased blood loss and antiinflammatory effects with TXA administration. Hemorrhagic shock (HS) related gut ischemia leads to disruption of the mucosal barrier. This has been attributed to entry of activated digestive enzymes into the intestinal wall and subsequent activation of mucosal associated matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9). Both &quot;systemic&quot; and enteral administration of TXA may protect the gut barrier following HS. The temporal response and mechanism(s) are unknown and served as the basis of the current study.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Caco-2 (intestinal cells) + HT29-MTX (mucus cells) intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) co cultures were established in a two-chamber cell culture system.

TXA was added in some experimental groups immediately after hypoxic challenge (Time 0) and then 60 and 120 minutes following reoxygenation. Trypsin activity was measured using a substrate specific assay (N &alpha;-Benzoyl-L-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride, BAPNA) at times corresponding to 60 minute intervals +/- TXA administration. MMP-9 was determined from intestinal lysates at corresponding times using Western blot analysis and quantified by relative density calculation. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Please see table.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The protective effect of TXA on gut barrier function may be due to inhibition of trypsin and subsequent MMP-9 activation. These effects were noted only with TXA administration within 60 minutes following the 90 minute IEC hypoxic challenge.

A recent study conducted in the southeastern region of the United States found that scooter and moped crashes (SMCs) that occurred at night resulted in more severe injuries. However, there were no recently published studies that looked at SMCs in the western region of the United States and furthermore there were no studies in the United States that investigated temporal aspects as they related to SMCs.  To understand the safety risks and to guide injury prevention, the objective of this study was to analyze temporal risk factors associated with SMCs in the Las Vegas metropolitan area.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We reviewed all patients injured by SMCs admitted to the only Level 1 Trauma Center in Nevada, located in Las Vegas, over an 8-year period from 2006-2013 (n=404).

There were patients with missing data points that were excluded from our analysis. Data was analyzed in SPSS 22 with significance set at p&lt;0.05.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:More than half (54%) of SMC patients were admitted during the day time.

Additionally, 52% of those admitted to the Intensive Care Unit were admitted during autumn and winter (p=0.012).  From our binary logistic regression model, time of day is the strongest predictor for having a brain and/or spinal injury after a SMC, followed by time of week (controlling for age, race, gender, and safety).

We hypothesized that patients receiving bolus only HTS would reach goal osmolality more rapidly than patients receiving continuous infusion HTS.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is an IRB-approved, retrospective cohort analysis of severe TBI patients at a Level 1 Trauma Center from January 2008 to May 2014 who received at least 2 doses of 3% sodium chloride. Inclusion criteria were ICP monitor or external ventricular drain while on HTS and greater than 48 hour ICU admission. Craniotomy patients were excluded. Eligible patients were identified using the Trauma Registry of the American College of Surgeons.  Patients were divided into bolus versus continuous infusion HTS cohorts.  The primary outcome was median time in hours to the first osmolality value within goal range of &ge; 310mOsm/kg. Secondary outcomes included percentage of patients reaching goal osmolality, percent time at goal osmolality, mean cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and ICP, ICU length of stay, and ICU mortality. Statistical analysis included, the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data and the Fisher's Exact test for categorical data.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the 162 patients included (30 bolus and 132 continuous), baseline characteristics were similar. The median injury severity score for the bolus and continuous group was 33.5 (IQR 26-42.8) and 37 (IQR 29-45) respectively. The median Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3 for each group.

Our goal was to develop morphometric roadmaps to enhance the safety and accuracy of fluoroscopy-free endovascular navigation of hemorrhage control devices.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Three-dimensional reconstructions of thin-section, contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography scans from n=122 subjects (mean age 47&plusmn;24 years, range 5-93 years old, 64 Male/58 Female) were used to measure centerline distances from femoral artery access sites to the major aortic branch artery origins. Morphometric roadmaps were created using multiple linear regression analysis to predict distances to the origins of the major arteries in the chest, abdomen and pelvis using torso length, demographics, and risk factors as independent variables. A hypothetical 40-mm long occlusion balloon was then virtually deployed into Zones 1 and 3 of the aorta using these roadmaps, with placement accuracy assessed by comparing predicted versus actual measured distances to the target locations within the aorta.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Torso length and age were the strongest predictors of centerline distances from femoral artery access sites to the major aortic branch artery origins. Male gender contributed to longer distances to aortic arch branches, while diabetes and smoking history were associated with shorter distances. Hypertension, dyslipidemia and coronary artery disease had no effect. Using morphometric roadmaps, virtual occlusion balloon placement accuracy was 100% for Zone 3 of the aorta, compared to 87% accuracy when using torso length alone (Figure).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Morphometric roadmaps demonstrate potential for improving the safety and accuracy of fluoroscopy-free aortic occlusion balloon delivery. Continued development and refinement of minimally invasive hemorrhage control techniques could lead to improvements in prehospital mortality for all age groups and both genders of patients with noncompressible torso hemorrhage.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Evidence based literature is lacking on data supporting Level II activation and consult guidelines for pediatric trauma patients. At our center, the current criteria for Level II TTA leads to a high rate of overtriage, especially with a large percentage of &lsquo;motor vehicle crashes (MVC) greater than 20 mph' and &lsquo;pedestrian or bike versus vehicle' being discharged from the emergency department (ED). This study was designed to evaluate possible options to optimize surgeons as resources by revising our current Level II activation criteria. We hypothesized that allowing ED to evaluate &lsquo;MVC&gt;20mph' and &lsquo;pedestrian or bike versus vehicle' prior to the Level II activation would significantly reduce the overtriage rate while maintaining an acceptable undertriage rate.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Trauma registry data was reviewed for a five-month period. Overtriage was defined as Level I and II TTAs that were discharged from the ED. Undertriage was defined as trauma consults that were admitted to the intensive care unit or had an injury severity score (ISS) greater than 16. The over and undertriage rates were calculated using the matrix method defined by ACS.  The two most common criteria resulting in overtriage were then identified, and the over and undertriage rates were recalculated with these criteria moved to the consult category. Charts were reviewed to verify that there were no missed injuries or diagnosis. Over and undertriage rates before and after criteria revision were statistically analyzed using the paired t-test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The over and undertriage rates using current criteria were 54.0% and 2.1%, respectively. The two criteria leading to the most overtriage were &lsquo;MVC&gt;20mph' and &lsquo;pedestrian or bike versus vehicle'. When the rates were recalculated moving these two criteria under the consult category, the overtriage rate was 37.3% (p &lt;0.001) and the undertriage rate was 2.7% (p 0.16).  After chart review no missed injuries or diagnosis were identified.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The overtriage rate and use of surgeons as resources in trauma activations may be reduced by allowing the ED to evaluate &lsquo;MVC&gt;20mph' and &lsquo;pedestrian or bike versus vehicle' prior to Level II activation, eliminating surgeon response for non-injured children. The protocol will be changed and the data will be prospectively collected and analyzed for follow-up to confirm that the overtriage and undertriage rates continue to meet the expected rates.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

However, the most appropriate timing of tracheostomy is still not well-determined. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We reviewed 500 consecutive tracheostomies over four years.  After exclusion criteria were applied, 417 patients remained.  We divided the cohort according to two benchmarks: tracheostomy before and after 7 days, and before and after 10 days on mechanical ventilation.  We then analyzed ICU length of stay (LOS), overall LOS, mortality, laboratory data, demographics, type of tracheostomy, post-operative complications, type of ICU, type of surgeon, and disposition after discharge.  We compared the variables with uni- and multi-variate logistic regression tests to determine if any were prognostic.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The early and late cohorts were comparable with regard to pre-operative characteristics and post-operative complications.  Pre-operative albumin was significantly higher in the early group.  Earlier tracheostomy was associated with shorter ICU and overall LOS.  Survival rates at 1, 6, and 12 months were not statistically different.  In multivariate logistic regression, higher albumin predicted decreased in-hospital mortality (p=0.003) and higher INR predicted increased in-hospital mortality (p=0.002)&mdash;better than timing of tracheostomy.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Early tracheostomy was associated with decreased ICU LOS (by 9-10 days) and overall LOS (by 8-10 days).  Timing of tracheostomy was not associated with a difference in mortality or disposition after discharge.  Preoperative albumin and INR are predictive for in-hospital mortality among patients who undergo tracheostomy.  Early tracheostomy does appear to be highly significantly associated with decreased LOS in the ICU and hospital, and therefore should be encouraged.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Patients were stratified by age into young and elderly groups using the age of 40 as a reference group based upon current Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines. Logistic regression was used to adjust for baseline differences in demographic and injury variables to determine the effect of age on outcomes. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, worsening discharge GCS, and discharge disposition.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 265 patients met inclusion criteria. Overall rate of craniotomy for the 6 year period was 12.4% and was not significantly different between groups. Elderly patients were more likely to be victims of falls and present with a higher GCS despite having a higher Head AIS. Immediate need for operative intervention was similar between groups. After adjusting for differences in characteristics, there was no significant difference in overall mortality (8%vs 15%, p=0.383), worsening discharge GCS (21%, p=0.187).or rehabilitation placement (32.9% vs. 23.15, p=0.740).

The current CDC field triage criteria suggest that anticoagulant history should be considered in patients not meeting physiologic or mechanistic criteria for trauma activation. We hypothesized that using anticoagulant history alone as a criteria after minor head trauma would result in a high over-triage rate and that patients transferred with documented Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) after minor head trauma would have similar outcomes to patients evaluated immediately by the trauma team.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This was a retrospective review of all trauma patients seen at a Level I trauma center (TC) during the past 3 years. History of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication was abstracted from chart review as well as admission demographic, physiologic, and outcome characteristics. Minor head injury was defined as an admission GCS&ge;13, SBP&gt;90, as well absence of tachypnea or mechanistic criteria set forth in the CDC field triage guidelines. Isolated TBI was defined as radiographic TBI+ other AIS&le;2. Over-triage was defined as patients that were discharged or admitted to medical services without traumatic injuries. Our primary outcomes were the over-triage rate as well as the comparison of in-hospital mortality, need for craniotomy, worsening GCS, and discharge disposition for those patients with TBI not directly seen in our trauma center (NTC). Chi-Square and Fishers exact test were used to compare categorical outcomes, continuous variables were compared using the students t-test or Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric variables.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the 3 year period a total of 273 patients with minor head injury were directly evaluated in TC with 108 (39.5%) patients having radiographic TBI resulting in an over-triage rate of 60.5%. During the same period 54 NTC anticoagulated patients were transferred with documented TBI. Patients sustaining TBI were similar with respect to age, race, mechanism of injury, GCS, and type of intracranial bleed. Median Head AIS (4) was similar as well as type of anticoagulant (ASA TC 63% vs. NTC 57%,p=0.500, Plavix 24%vs.15%,p=0.221, Coumadin 31%vs.46%,p=0.057).

The objective was to evaluate correlation of geospatial trauma system resources and injury mortality in Pennsylvania (PA).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Trauma centers and helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) bases in PA were mapped. Scene mortality rates were obtained at the county-level from the PA trauma registry. Service areas were generated for HEMS and ground EMS (GEMS) transport to a trauma center within 60min, accounting for response and scene times. Trauma system resources in each county including number of trauma centers or HEMS bases, proportion covered by HEMS and GEMS service areas were categorized as high or low by median values. Mortality was compared between high and low trauma system resources. Local Moran&#39;s I was used to identify geographic outlier clusters. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) evaluated association of mortality with trauma system resources, adjusting for county-level demographics, injury severity, and socioeconomic factors. Correlation of weighted mortality and resources from GWR was examined.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 63,706 blunt and 6,260 penetrating patients were included. Blunt mortality was spatially autocorrelated (Moran I 0.22, p&lt;0.01). Fig 1 demonstrates blunt mortality with trauma system resources. High HEMS coverage was associated with lower mortality (4.2% v 5.7%, p=0.04). Mortality was not associated with high number of trauma centers/HEMS bases (p=0.20) or high GEMS coverage (p=0.07). Outlier clusters with high mortality and low resources were seen in southcentral and northwest PA (p&lt;0.01), while clusters of low mortality and high resources were seen in southwest and southeast PA (p&lt;0.05). In GWR, mortality was inversely correlated with HEMS coverage (&rho;=-0.71, p&lt;0.01), GEMS coverage (&rho;=-0.69, p&lt;0.01), and number of trauma centers/HEMS bases (&rho;=-0.38, p&lt;0.01). Penetrating mortality was also autocorrelated (Moran I 0.36, p&lt;0.01). High number of county trauma centers/HEMS bases was associated with lower mortality (13% v 26%, p&lt;0.01), as was high HEMS coverage (13% v 25%, p&lt;0.01) and high GEMS coverage (13% v 21%, p&lt;0.01).

Census information regarding income level was used to stratify patients into three income groups (low, middle &amp; high), based on percentage of the census tract below the poverty line.   Rural was defined on the county level, using county health district designations.  Differences in demographics, insurance status, mode of transport, injury severity score (ISS), hospital length of stay (LOS), need for health services after hospital discharge and mortality were compared between urban and rural patients within each income group.

We selected all patients who underwent an emergency thoracotomy for traumatic arrest (no vital signs after sustaining an injury). Logistic regression analyses were utilized to assess factors associated with survival after ERT. Propensity score matching was used to match patients receiving ERT with similarly injured patients in traumatic arrest that did not undergo ERT. Separate analyses were performed for blunt and penetrating injuries.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 4 million records in the dataset, 31,528 (0.9%) patients presented in traumatic arrest.

Penetrating injury occurred in 80% of patients and the overall survival was 2.2%. On multivariate analysis patients more likely to survive were Black compared with White, insured, with stab wounds, severe chest injuries, and those transported by private vehicle versus ground ambulance. After propensity matching, patients with penetrating injuries were 44% more likely to survive if they underwent an ERT (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.38-0.83).

Currently available data on the incidence and overall burden of sports-related ocular trauma are limited or outdated. In 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a comprehensive model for the classification of sports and recreation-related injury. We applied this model to estimate and characterize the burden of sports and recreation-related (S/R) ocular injury in the United States.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, we identified patients presenting with a diagnosis of ocular trauma from 2006-2012. We then examined ICD-9CM codes to identify individuals with S/R ocular injuries using the CDC's comprehensive classification system. Age, sex, external mechanism of injury, type of S/R activity, and other factors were used to characterize and stratify injuries. Comparisons were made within and between injury strata across time. Data specific to individual team sports were not readily available until 2010; a subset was created to characterize those injuries from 2010-2012.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 287,718 ED visits associated with a diagnosis of S/R-related ocular injury occurred from 2006-2012. Males represented 78.8% of cases, and that proportion did not vary significantly across the 7-year period. The proportion of all ocular trauma cases that were S/R-related rose a relative 36.3%, from 3.8% of all injuries in 2006 to 5.2% in 2012. Overall, the leading single cause of S/R ocular injury was pedal cycling&mdash;an activity resulting in 34,965 (12.2%) S/R ocular injuries. The number of patients presenting cycling-related ocular injuries increased from 4,076 in 2006 to 5,623 in 2012. Among team sports, basketball resulted in the highest number of ocular injuries, with 17,018 patients presenting to the ED between 2010 and 2012. The next most common sport was baseball (12,734), followed by soccer (5,787), football (4,844), and watersports (2,063). During the study period, 291 patients were hospitalized with baseball-related ocular injury, 82 for basketball-related eye injury, 59 for soccer, and 45 for football-related injuries.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Despite an overall reduction in the number of all-cause ocular trauma cases reporting to the ED across the study period, the absolute number of S/R ocular trauma cases presenting for care increased significantly. The observed increase in S/R ocular trauma presentations appears to be driven in part by a 38.0% increase in the number of bicycle-related ocular injuries, which tend to be more severe (23.9% of cases resulting in hospitalization). Basketball remains the leading cause of S/R ocular injuries among the team sports, but hospitalization rates for baseball are 4.6 times higher than those for basketball (2.3% vs 0.5%).  Efforts aimed at preventing serious vision-threatening injury may be most effectively focused on high energy S/R activities such as cycling and baseball.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Identification of patients who will require SI remains difficult despite multiple severity classification systems. In our review; direct admission, WBC &gt; 16, presence of respiratory failure, and pancreatic necrosis/infection significantly increased the odds of receiving SI.

Hoth<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Wake Forest University School Of Medicine,General Surgery,Winston-Salem, NC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Trauma patients with cirrhosis are known to have a poor prognosis. The subset of injured patients (pts) with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and cirrhosis would be expected to do poorly, but the impact of this combination on outcome and resource utilization has not been addressed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of cirrhosis in conjunction with TBI.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review was conducted through our trauma registry from 2010-2014. Cirrhotic pts with TBI were identified and compared to a non-cirrhotic group that was matched 1:1 for gender, age, type of TBI, Abbreviated Injury Score for the respective TBI, Injury Severity Score, and other traumatic injury. Student's t-test and &chi; 2 were used for analysis and a p&lt;0.05 considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 24 pts with cirrhosis and TBI were identified and matched to 24 non-cirrhosis control pts. Pts with cirrhosis had a higher mortality (37% vs. 4%, p=0.01), longer length of stay (11.25 days vs. 5.79 days, p=0.008), ICU days (5.67 vs. 1.91, p=0.007), and ventilator days (4.04 vs. 0.75, p=0.003). In addition, the cirrhosis group had increased incidence of infection/sepsis (14 vs. 2, p=0.005) and need for transfusions (13 vs. 2, p=0.001). Furthermore, 66% of surviving cirrhosis pts were discharged to a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility vs. 13% in the control group (p=0.0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Cirrhosis in TBI is an exceptionally poor prognostic indicator, with more than 1 in 3 dying of their injuries. The average length of stay, ICU stay, and ventilator days in cirrhotics is also significantly longer compared to a matched non-cirrhosis group. Furthermore, they are larger consumers of resources since they are at higher risk of sepsis and need for transfusions. This indicates an increased utilization of hospital resources. In addition, 2/3 of pts that survive require a skilled nursing or acute rehabilitation facility on discharge. Overall, only 21% (5/24 pts) from the cirrhosis group are discharged to home, compared to 83% (20/24 pts) in the non-cirrhosis group.  For cirrhotic patients with TBI that survive their hospitalization, there is further increased utilization of outpatient health resources. These data can be used to inform discussions of realistic goals of care in this difficult population.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

We included blunt trauma patients &gt;=18 years, treated at level 1 or 2 trauma centers (TCs), with a GCS&lt;=8, Head AIS&gt;3 and mechanically ventilated &gt;72 hours. The proportion of patients undergoing MRI at each hospital was calculated. Multi-level modeling was used to identify patient- and hospital- level factors associated with MRI use.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We included 32,125 patients treated at 395 unique TCs. The mean proportion of MRI over the entire sample was 9.9%. Amongst the 181 hospitals (57.8% of all admissions) that performed and reported MRIs, the proportions of patients who received MRI per hospital ranged from 0.5-68.4%. (Figure) Younger patients, MVC and pedestrian injuries were more likely to receive an MRI. Injury severity (ISS) was not associated with MRI use. Hospitals in the northeast, level 1 TCs, and non-teaching hospitals were more likely to perform MRI.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:After controlling for patient-level characteristics, variation remained in MRI use based on hospital specific, geographic, trauma center level, and teaching status characteristics.

We used these reports together with the Suffolk Country Trauma Registry Data to examine which criteria had the greatest positive predictive value for trauma resource need.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Retrospective structured study. Cases were matched with the County's regional Trauma Registry. The study was approved by our IRB. All adult patients with a TPCR from 2003 to 2007 were eligible for inclusion.The occurrences, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of each trauma triage criteria for the major outcomes of ISS &gt; 15 and major OR/death were noted. Models were created to determine which trauma triage criteria would allow the greatest sensitivity, specificity, and NPVfor predicting ISS &gt;15 or major OR/death while maintaining a minimum PPV of 20%. The decision rules for both models were to select variables with the largest PPV and to stop selection when the PPV of the overall model was &lt; 20.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:17120 TPCR's were analyzed. The criteria that were significant in the ISS&gt;15 model, in order,were flail chest, RR &lt; 10 or &gt; 28, amputation, multitrauma, long bone fracture, GCS &lt;14, SBP &lt;90, death of same vehicle occupant, ejection from vehicle and pelvic fracture. This model achieved a sensitivity of 46%, specificity of 97%, PPV of 20% and NPV of 99%. The criteria that were significant in the major OR/death, in order, were flail chest, long bone fracture, amputation, RR &lt; or &gt; 28, multitrauma, SBP &lt; 90, GCS &lt; 14 and death of samevehicle occupant. This model achieved a sensitivity of 38%,specificity of 97%, PPV of 22% and NPV of 99%.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The goal of trauma triage guidelines is to minimize both under triage (so patients can receivethe specialized trauma care they require) and over triage (so patients do not consume scarce resources unnecessarily). In the 2011 Guidelines for Field Triage of Injured Patients, the panel decided to only include criteria that had a minimum PPV of 20% for predicting severe injury.Our study shows that models that place PPV at the lower limit of 20 are able to achieve high specificity and NPV but poor sensitivity. Such models would result in little over triage but significant under triage. Additionally, the first eight criteria for both models (ISS&gt;15 and major OR/death) were the same, indicating that the same criteria are predictive for different outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

The operating surgeon was identified from patient medical records along with other details of vascular injuries, radiological findings, operative repairs and complications. Regression analysis was performed to compare outcomes of amputations, complications, mortality and hospital length of stay.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 76 patients were included. Mean age was 31 &plusmn; 13 years; median extremity AIS [IQR] score was 3 [3 &ndash; 3], and overall complication, amputation, and mortality rates were 35.5%, 9.2%, and 5.3% respectively.

Physicians often initiate or participate in discussions regarding DNR status for patients whose care is considered futile. However, the impact of this decision on patient outcomes is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of DNR status on mortality and rate of complications. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A two year (2011-2012) retrospective analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) was performed. Trauma patients older than 65 years, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and who underwent a major surgical procedure were included. Patients who were transferred, intoxicated, arrived with no vital signs, or died in the ED, were excluded. Patients with DNR status were identified based on advanced directives for end of life care. Matched no-DNR controls were identified using propensity score matching, controlling for age, gender, race, injury severity score, comorbidities, abbreviated injury score for head, and admission vitals. Primary outcomes were mortality, complications, and failure to rescue (FTR). FTR was defined as death after complication. Missing data was accounted for by using missing value analysis and multiple imputation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 3,744 patients (DNR: 1,872 vs No-DNR: 1,872) were included in the analysis. Average age was 81 &plusmn; 6 years (mean &plusmn; SD) and 47% of patients were male. Median (IQR) Injury Severity Score was 13 (9 &ndash; 21). Overall mortality rate was 27%, complication rate was 49%, and FTR rate was 17%. Patients with DNR status had significantly higher mortality rates (36% vs. 17%, p &lt; 0.001), complication rates (53% vs. 44%, p &lt; 0.001), and FTR rates (23% vs. 10%, p &lt; 0.001) compared to the No-DNR group.

Over half of trauma deaths in low-income countries are the result of airway compromise, respiratory failure, or uncontrolled hemorrhage; all three conditions can be addressed using simple first-aid measures. As medical students in developing countries graduate and go directly into practice, they require basic trauma skills that are not incorporated into the curriculum.  Basic trauma resuscitation training in modified ABCD (airway, breathing, circulation, disability) techniques can be easily learned and applied to increase trauma capacity in developing countries.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In Mozambique, 102 medical students were trained in basic trauma resuscitation skills that utilized resources available to them in both urban or rural areas.

Evidence-based policies for injury prevention and management in the districts of Uganda are hindered by the lack of available data regarding patterns of musculoskeletal injuries presenting to district hospitals. Our pilot orthopedic trauma registry establishes a framework for broader district hospital injury surveillance systems.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We collected data via patient interview, examination, and x-rays from all patients presenting to Mityana, Entebbe, and Nakaseke Hospitals with musculoskeletal injuries from October 2013 to January 2014. We compared patient demographics to the 2011 Ugandan Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset and determined predictors of delayed presentation for care greater than 24 hours after injury via multivariate logistic regression.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Men, adults, and individuals with post-secondary education were more common among patients than in the DHS population. Common causes included road traffic injuries (RTI) (48.5%) and falls (25.1%). Closed, simple fractures comprised 70% of injuries. The major extremity long bones comprised 84% of fractures. Patients suffering assaults or falls were more likely delayed to care than victims of RTI, with OR 3.97 (95% CI: 1.41, 11.16) and OR 2.34 (95% CI: 1.21, 4.55), respectively. Compared to the self-employed, subsistence farmers (OR 2.99, 95% CI: 1.15, 7.91), motorcycle taxi drivers (OR 10.50, 95% CI: 1.92, 64.57), and pre-school children (OR 4.24, 95% CI: 1.05, 17.39) were significantly more likely to be delayed to care after adjustment for covariates. Subsistence farmers were more likely than other occupations to seek care from traditional bonesetters prior to seeking hospital care (23% v 7%, p=0.001). All patients who visited bonesetters were delayed to hospital care, compared to 28% of patients who sought hospital care first (p&lt;&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Understanding patterns of musculoskeletal injury at district hospitals facilitates allocation of limited resources for orthopedic provider training, referral protocols, and trauma systems strengthening. To promote the safety of all Ugandans, policies should target interventions aimed at improving access to timely care to vulnerable groups such as subsistence farmers, motorcycle taxi drivers, and pre-school children. Effective policy can only be enacted by engaging local stakeholders such as traditional bonesetters in the advocacy conversation. Development of evidence-based national injury prevention and orthopedic healthcare policies would similarly benefit from district hospital data from across Uganda, in the form of a national trauma registry.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

Affected children of non-Caucasian ethnicities residing in resource-challenged countries often demonstrate advanced stage disease at presentation and experience dismal survival from WT. However, poverty and limited access to healthcare may not entirely explain these disparate findings, as ethnic variations in the genetic profile of WT could too contribute to its tumorigenesis, disease progression, treatment resistance, and overall poor survival. Interestingly, the survival rate from WT in the impoverished nation of Iraq was a mere 51% at last report in 2008, but no genetic or epidemiologic explanation for this unacceptably low survival was provided. The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic profile of WT in Iraqi children as a foundation to identify novel therapeutic targets.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  WT patients (n=154) who were treated at the Children's Welfare Teaching Hospital in Baghdad, Iraq between June 2008 and March 2014 were selected for potential molecular evaluation. Tissue samples from 35 patients could be located given the political challenges in that region during this time. Genomic DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples was analyzed using next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify single nucleotide variations, insertions, and deletions in ten target genes documented to promote Wilms tumorigenesis (WT1, CTNNB1, WTX, and IGF2) or disease maintenance (TP53, MYC-N, CITED1, SIX2, CRABP2, and TOP2A).  Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate expression of proteins (WT1, CTNNB1, NCAM, CITED1, SIX2, and TP53) fundamental to WT biology.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Using NGS, we detected mutations in previously identified loci of WT1 and CTNNB1 as well as novel loci that may be unique to the Iraqi population. Immunohistochemistry for 6 marker proteins (WT1, CTNNB1, NCAM, CITED1, SIX2, and p53) of WT showed expression patterns typical of blastemal-predominant specimens, a poor prognostic feature in certain regions of the world. The median clinical follow up was 40.5 months (range, 6-78 months). Only one child, whose WT contained mutations in both WT1 and CTNNB1, was confirmed dead from disease among this cohort despite the healthcare and socioeconomic challenges unique to the Iraqi population.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study is the first to report the molecular characterization of WT in Iraqi children. Although limited by small sample size due to regional challenges, our analysis suggests that WT obtained from this Iraqi cohort shares some biological features of specimens observed in other nations but also exhibits potentially distinguishing genetic features. Once validated in a larger series, these findings will direct the future development of targeted molecular therapies that may improve WT survival in Iraq and other impoverished nations in the Middle East.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is designed to eliminate somatic incisional pain and is used at times during short-term surgical missions (STSM) to LMICs .We hypothesized that TAP would decrease both early narcotic consumption and postoperative pain during STSM. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients who underwent open cholecystectomy during STSM.  All patients were treated with Tylenol 800- 1000 mg PO, Tramadol 50 mg PO, and Toradol 30 mg IV (standard postoperative analgesic regimen).  TAP blocks were performed on select patients with 20 ml 0.5% Ropivacaine under ultrasound guidance 30 minutes post op.  Data collected included age, gender, ASA, duration of anesthesia and surgery, initial post-op pain score. Outcomes measured included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score at rest (30 mins -2 hrs post-op), intravenous (IV) narcotic doses administered and hospital length of stay (LOS).  A comparative analysis was then performed using Student's T-test (mean &plusmn; SD). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 22 patients underwent open cholecystectomy, of those, 11 (50%) received a TAP block.  Gender, ASA, and duration of anesthesia were not significantly different among the groups.  Age, duration of surgery, and initial pain score were significantly different (Table).  Patients who received a TAP block had a 46% decrease in narcotics administered and a 30% shorter LOS when compared to the standard group (Table).   No significant difference was noted in the pain scores between the TAP and the standard group (5.2 &plusmn; 1.2 vs. 4.7 &plusmn; 2.2, respectively, p &gt; 0.5) and no complications from the TAP procedure were reported. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: TAP block after open cholecystectomy reduces narcotic usage and shortens LOS during STSMs. TAP block is safe and effective adjunct to standard pain regimen in the early postoperative course in LMIC.

The assumption is that more complex data collection is equal to more accurate data and therefore allows better predictions of outcomes. We hypothesized that data is often needlessly complex and that complexity can be a burden to those collecting and analyzing the data. Moreover, it is a barrier to data collection in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC's). We sought to demonstrate this concept by examination of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical classification system.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We created every possible two, three and four category combinations of the current five category ASA score. This resulted in 14 combinations of simplified ASA with 2, 3 or 4 categories. We then compared the predictive ability of these simplified scores for post-operative outcomes on all patients in the NSQIP database from 2006-2012 (2.3 million patients). We created unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models using these 14 different combinations of simplified ASA scores as the predictor variable. Individual model performance was assessed by comparing Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves for each model with the standard ASA model using the outcomes of in-hospital and 30-day mortality and any morbidity.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Two of our 4-category models (ASA 1&amp;2, 3, 4,5 and ASA 1, 2, 3, 4&amp;5) and one of our 3-category models (ASA 1&amp;2, 3, 4&amp;5) had ability to predict all outcomes equivalent to standard ASA. Two of the 2-category variables (ASA 1&amp;2&amp;3, 4&amp;5 and ASA 1&amp;2, 3&amp;4&amp;5) provided good estimates that were only slightly worse than standard ASA. These results held for all outcomes and on all subgroups tested. The performance of the 3 best simplified ASA scores were also equivalent to the standard ASA score in the univariate analysis and multivariate analysis.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Currently there is a desire to strive for the most granular data and use the largest number of variables for risk-adjusted predictions. This complexity is often at the expense of utility. We have used the single best predictor in surgical outcomes research to show this is not necessarily the case. In this example of the ASA scoring system our data show that one can simplify ASA into a 3-category variable without losing any ability to predict patient outcomes. Further research is needed to determine whether other commonly used scoring systems can be simplified without compromising their discrimination ability. When working in LMIC's simple systems that operate just as well as more complex ones will help to facilitate the spread of surgical data collection and thereby lead to improvements in patient care.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

Bolivia is a LMIC that lacks a cohesive emergency response system and accessible pre-hospital care, including adequately trained first-responders. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers layperson first-responders as an essential component of effective trauma systems in low-resource settings to increase the emergency medical workforce capacity. This study sought to analyze participant evaluations on a novel trauma first-responder course (TFRC) offered in La Paz, Bolivia. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The TFRC was offered for a nominal fee to adults in the department of La Paz. An American surgeon and medical student led nine separate eight-hour sessions in March and April 2013. There were didactic and practical components that built upon existing training course models with local stakeholder input, ensuring the covered material accounted for local area needs and treatment resources. At the conclusion of the course participants completed a program evaluation, which included a self-assessment of knowledge and skill acquisition, course reflections and individual session ratings. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: One hundred fifty-nine participants completed evaluations for analysis, of which 97.5% rated the course as useful and 96.7% believed they would apply the skills learned in the future. Median participant self-confidence ratings in first aid skills (range 0-5) showed an upward trend from baseline to post-course (4 vs. 5). Ninety-one percent of participants deemed the depth of training appropriate, with only 3.2% and 5.8% rating it as too basic or overly technical, respectively. The majority of respondents were in favor of introducing more topics and increasing the length of practical sessions in future course offerings. The 13 didactic and four practical sessions were individually graded on quality, resulting in median scores of 4 or higher on a five-point scale, where five indicates excellent.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study represents the first offering of a novel TFRC in a resource-limited setting that received largely positive evaluations from course participants.  Responses were almost unanimously affirmative on course usefulness, as well as suitable subject depth and coverage of context-appropriate topics. Participant feedback suggests offering more didactic sessions on locally relevant topics and increasing the length of practical sessions in future iterations. While a majority of medical personnel attended these initial TFRCs, future work will aim to expand enrollment to layperson first-responders whom the WHO identifies as critical components of pre-hospital care in LMICs. All of which strongly support the further development and expansion of this TFRC throughout Bolivia, filling the gap in basic trauma training and moving towards improved care of the injured.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

In this Ugandan tertiary hospital, an average of 50 patients per month are admitted with bowel obstruction, with 31 operations performed in the emergency OR. Previous work confirmed that intestinal helminths accounted for over half of cases of intestinal obstruction in this hospital, but deworming programs have decreased this burden over the last decades. Meanwhile, adhesions are the predominant cause in high-income settings. . This study aimed to characterize the presentation of these patients and the causes of bowel obstruction, to compare with past data, and with high-income settings. We also examined factors associated with outcome.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a prospective study from December 2013 to May 2014 of patients admitted with a suspected diagnosis of bowel obstruction, to this tertiary hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Inclusion criteria required at least one imaging study suggestive of partial or complete intestinal obstruction. Ethical approval was obtained from the hospital and university IRB. A questionnaire was developed and piloted before being revised and used. Univariate analysis was performed of age, gender, marital status, religion, education, and income level along with presenting symptoms, and signs to assess association with 'favorable' or 'unfavorable' outcomes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:110 patients were enrolled, with 72% males and 41% were children under 12 years old. 50% of the patients presented 72 hours after symptom onset with 25% receiving initial management in a lower level health center before reaching the tertiary hospital, while 7% presented within 24 hours of symptom onset. Colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, distension and relative constipation were the most common presenting symptoms. The most common causes were obstructed hernias (21%), volvulus (12%), and adhesions and tumors (9%). Among children (&lt;13), the most common causes were intussusception (9%), anorectal malformations (8%) and atresia (6%). 48% of patients underwent surgery without imaging. Laparotomy with bowel resection and anastomosis was required in 82% cases, and 62% of the patients with obstructed hernias required herniorraphy. Male gender, extremes of age (&lt;1 or &gt;50), marital status (single), and symptoms were associated with unfavorable outcomes (p&lt;0.05) on univariate analysis. In multiple logistic regression, only symptoms were associated with unfavorable outcomes (p&lt;0.05).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Men more frequently presented with intestinal obstruction, with typical symptoms. Obstructed hernias are the most common cause of bowel obstruction now, compared to previously, when intestinal worms were more common. Children comprise a significant portion of the burden, underscoring the need for pediatric emergency surgical services.  Clinical symptoms have a greater degree of association with unfavorable outcomes than demographic factors.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

As a key component of universal health coverage, there is a critical need for a comprehensive assessment of existing surgical care. This study uses a mixed methods approach to evaluate the barriers and facilitators of quality surgical care delivery at a regional referral hospital in rural Uganda.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  From 1<sup>st</sup> May to 22<sup>nd</sup> June 2015, we conducted quantitative and qualitative research activities to assess emergency surgical care at a regional referral hospital. The Personnel, Infrastructure, Procedures, Equipment and Supplies (PIPES) tool from Surgeons OverSeas was used to evaluate surgical capacity. We reviewed hospital records from 1<sup>st</sup> May to 22<sup>nd</sup> June , 2015 to determine surgical inpatient volume and occupancy rates. Emergency surgical care processes were observed prospectively over 53 consecutive days using time-and-motion methodology. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted on all quantitative components. Thematic analysis was conducted on four semi-structured focus group discussions with 18 purposively sampled providers involved in the process of surgical care delivery.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The PIPES tool revealed severe deficiencies in personnel and infrastructure. Major barriers to quality were lacking infrastructure, inadequate skills and workforce, and large numbers of patients&#39; attendants. Surgical inpatient volume was high, with wards booked beyond maximum bed capacity 83% and 60% of the time for males and females, respectively. Equipment, supplies, and procedures were generally available. Teamwork and dedication among providers were the main facilitators of quality care; challenges are tackled with teamwork, task sharing and innovative life-saving improvisations for lacking equipment (eg. underwater seal, chest tub) and processes. The median decision-to-intervention time (DIT) (n-31) was 2.5 hours [0.1 &ndash; 95]. However, 48.4% of subjects experienced delays. The median DIT delay was 14.8 hours [0.1 &ndash; 71.9].<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The Regional Referral Hospital faces severe limitations in infrastructure, workforce, and skills required to adequately address the surgical needs of its population. We advocate for an increase in surgical workforce and training opportunities in conjunction with the expansion of the surgical wards and theater, in order to enhance the surgical capacity and cater for the huge surgical demand. There is a place for symbiotic partnerships with international development partners to improve surgical capacity and quality. The role of local policy and governance will be critical in creating an enabling environment for quality surgical care delivery and for sustainability.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

Health planners and ministries of health would benefit from this type of data to inform key decisions. We used a data visualization tool to analyze surgical infrastructure, capacity, and availability of surgical care in Zambia.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All hospitals providing surgical care in 2010 were identified in cooperation with the Zambian Ministry of Health. On-site data collection included location and type of hospital, procedure availability, human resources, and infrastructure using an adapted WHO Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care survey from October 2010 through August 2011. Data were geocoded using ArcGIS 10.3 and analyzed in Redivis, an online visualization platform. We analyzed time and distance to surgical services, as well as the proportion of the population covered within a two-hour travel time, as recommended by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Data were collected from all 103 surgical facilities identified as providing surgical care using direct observations and 495 interviews with providers at the facilities. When including all surgical facilities (regardless of human resources and supplies), 8% of the population (1.16 million people) lived more than a 2-hour drive from surgical care (Figure 1a). When the World Health Organization criteria for minimal safety standards (the minimal complement of equipment and supplies to maintain an airway, resuscitation and sterility for surgical care) were included in the analysis, access declined; only 17 (16.5%) hospitals met the minimum standards of surgical safety, defined as the availability of a pulse oximeter, adult bag mask, oxygen, suction, intravenous fluid, sterile gloves, skin preparation solution, and a functioning sterilizer. Geospatial analysis of these 17 hospitals showed that 58% of the population (8.41 million people) lived more than a 2-hour drive from a facility with a minimal complement of infrastructure for surgical care (Figure 1b).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A large proportion of the population in Zambia does not have access to safe and timely surgical care. Our study highlights that overall Zambia has sufficient surgical centers spread out across the country. However, human resources, infrastructure, and supplies within these facilities are limited and must be addressed to improve access to safe surgical care. The use of geospatial visualization tools assists in the evaluation of surgical infrastructure in Zambia, and can identify key areas for improvement. This type of geospatial analysis could help with health system planning across many countries and health services.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

While peritonitis often requires surgical intervention, little is known regarding the associated costs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: As part of a larger study examining the epidemiology and outcomes of patients with peritonitis at a referral hospital in Rwanda, hospital costs associated with peritonitis were examined. Data were collected on demographics, clinical features, and outcomes. Continuous variables were reported as means and standard deviations (SD). Costs were reported as US dollars (USD). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over a six-month period, 281 patients underwent operation for peritonitis. Common diagnoses included: obstruction (39%), appendicitis (17%), and trauma (14%). 254 (93%) patients had government-sponsored health insurance, covering at least 90% of in-hospital costs.Cost analyses were available for 245 patients. The mean total hospital cost was 379 USD (SD 325), which is 58% of the Rwanda gross national income per capita. Mean patient cost was 42 USD (SD 79). Medications comprised the largest proportion (37%) of total hospital costs (mean 142 USD, SD 171).Total hospital cost varied with length of hospital stay and diagnosis. Hospital stay was longer in patients diagnosed with typhoid perforation (mean 18.1 days, SD 15.6) and cholecystitis (mean 14.3 days, SD 4.9). Higher costs were seen in patients diagnosed with cholecystitis (mean 760 USD, SD 530) and typhoid perforation (mean 726 USD, SD 442).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Surgical costs for peritonitis at a Rwandan referral hospital were reasonable, though total hospital costs equate to a significant portion of gross national income per capita. Most patients were eligible for government-sponsored insurance, which minimized costs for patients and families. Decreasing the length of hospital stay and minimizing costs is critical in a low-resource setting to decrease the financial burden of disease.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

Effective trauma systems, including pre-hospital, hospital and rehabilitative care, lead to decreased mortality and improved functional outcomes. Yet many low-resource settings like Bolivia lack in one or more of these areas. We sought to survey trauma first responder course (TFRC) participants in La Paz and Potosi, Bolivia regarding the current state of emergency training, trauma experience and healthcare facility access.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  From March to May 2013 a nominally priced, eight-hour TFRC was offered in Bolivia. Nine sessions were held in the department of La Paz, a largely populated, urban setting; and ten courses took place in seven municipalities in the Potosi region, a more rural mining community. Participants completed a baseline survey on personal demographics, prior emergency experiences, first-aid training, and health facility access. Categorical and continuous variables were analyzed by Pearson's chi squared and Wilcoxon rank sum tests, respectively.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 514 participants met criteria for study inclusion: n=355 in Potosi and n=159 in La Paz. There were higher proportions of medically trained (76.8% vs. 59.5%, p&lt;0.001) and university-educated (81.1% vs. 61.4%, p&lt;0.001) individuals in Potosi; while participants in La Paz had more prior trauma training (71.3% vs. 51.5%, p&lt;0.001), emergency experiences in the past six months (68.6% vs. 43.9%, p&lt;0.001) and higher numbers of emergencies seen per respondent (median 21.5 vs. 5, p&lt;0.001). The most common injury mechanisms across both regions were road traffic crashes (median 5, IQR 2, 15) and falls (median 3, IQR 1, 8). Sixty-six percent of individuals in La Paz had provided assistance in an emergency versus 40% in Potosi (p&lt;0.001), while most participants had access to first aid equipment in both locations (Potosi 77.9% vs. La Paz 83.1%, p=0.20). Health centers were considered the primary emergency care facility in Potosi (43.4%) versus hospitals in La Paz  (51.6%, p=0.004), despite a majority of participants in both locales reporting an estimated 10 to 30 minute travel time to the closest hospital (p=0.015). On univariable analysis, there was no significant association between assisting in an emergency and pre-test score, prior training, self-reported baseline skill confidence level or profession.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The baseline TFRC survey captures fundamental information on existing local emergency response resources, workforce experiences and injury patterns. Participants reported a significant exposure to trauma cases, with variable access or ability to provide appropriate and timely medical care, highlighting a gap in basic emergency skills and supply availability in the community. This confirms the need for sustainable improvements in pre-hospital care in Bolivia, including additional training, resources and systems planning, to eventually decrease injury morbidity and mortality.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

This study sought to describe the epidemiology and outcomes of patients undergoing operation for peritonitis at a major referral hospital in Rwanda. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This report describes data on all patients presenting to a Rwandan referral hospital with clinical features of peritonitis over a six-month period. Data were collected on demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory and radiographic studies, operative findings, and complications. The primary goal was to describe the epidemiology and etiology of peritonitis at a referral hospital in Rwanda.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 281 patients presenting with peritonitis over a six-month period of which 217 (77%) were adult and 64 (23%) were pediatric. Most patients were male (68%). Localized peritonitis accounted for 32% of cases while 68% were generalized. 72 (26%) of patients presented to the hospital with symptoms lasting for more than a week. The most common cause of peritonitis was intestinal obstruction (39%), followed by appendicitis (17%) and trauma (14%). Females were more likely to be diagnosed with appendicitis (29% versus 10%, p&lt;0.001) or tumor (7.8% versus 2.6%, p=0.046) whereas males were more likely to be diagnosed with a traumatic injury (18% versus 4%, p=0.002) or peptic ulcer perforation (210% versus 3%, p=0.042). 46 (16%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively and 27 (10%) patients required vasopressors.

Three rounds of questionnaires were used to create a list of criteria for an optimal international trauma rotation for US general surgical residents.  Content analysis of responses was used to generate categories from the criteria.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Consensus responses generated 37 criteria that could be organized into four categories. The most common criterion reported was safety in the host country (78%).  The top three most commonly noted criteria for each category are:  1) host nation requirements: sustainability/long-term commitment (56%); strong local champion/mentor (56%); local residency training program and educational curriculum (67%); 2) sponsoring US institution requirements:  bi-directional training (44%); strong/supportive mentorship (44%); support and credit approved by American Board of Surgery (44%); 3) surgery resident requirements:  required research with scholarly work including both US/host nation authors (33%); participation in ongoing advocacy projects in host nation (22%); commitment to participate in global surgery journal club and/or grand rounds in both institutions (33%); and 4) rotation specific requirements:  minimum length of 4 weeks (67%); safe and accessible accommodation/daily living (78%); exposure to breadth of injury care in resource limited settings (67%).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  The top responses indicate that safety, minimum length of 4 weeks, exposure to breadth of injury care in resource limited settings and a local educational curriculum are the most important features of an international trauma rotation. With increasing interest among US surgical residents and programs to participate in global surgery endeavors, criteria to establish an optimal surgery resident international trauma experience were created. US institutional leadership and surgery program directors must ensure safety and an optimal educational experience for surgery residents, as well as demonstrate long-term commitment to trauma care in the resource-limited setting.

Interventions are critical to increase women representation within the field. Until the formation of DREAM (Dedicated to Reach, Empower, and Mentor) Zimbabwe had no specialty student interest groups; we report the early results of a novel focused interest group to support women students interested in surgical training.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The student organization; DREAM was established in 2014 as a mentorship and information-sharing platform for undergraduate women students interested in surgery. Its objectives are to reach (present surgery as an attractive career option), empower (with information, basic surgical skills and opportunities for participation) and mentor (peer, group, personal and e-mentorship) women with the goal of increasing the numbers of Zimbabwean women in surgery.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Since its inception in March 2014 DREAM's membership has increased from the founding 6 fourth year medical students  (MBChB) to its current membership of 36 consisting of 3rd, 4th, 5th year medical students and 1st year interns ((58, 11, 25 and 6% respectively). 8 group mentorship sessions have been held with local and visiting surgeons from the US, Japan, China and Australia. Some of these relationships have continued in the form of personal or e-mentorship. Some members participated at the 2014 College of Surgeons East, Central, and Southern Africa (COSECSA) which is currently discussing its role in promoting the development of women surgeons in the region. DREAM organized clerkships for some of its members in Tanzania, the US and New Zealand in 2014. In July 2015 the organization hosted the first ever basic surgical skills training for medical students which was attended by 21 members. Stemming from this event the 'sisterhood' peer-mentorship initiative was begun in which senior female medical students provide bedside mentorship to junior students during clinical rotations. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Just two years after its inception; this initiative has shown great potential for increasing women's participation in surgery in Zimbabwe. There are currently 5 graduating students and 2 first year interns  committed to surgical training.  Significant challenges exist that will have to be addressed.  For example all Zimbabwean graduates complete 2 years as rotating house officer after which the majority become licensed independent physicians and do not pursue further specialty training.  This hiatus after graduation and option to have a full-time job presents significant challenges to keep engagement and subsequent matriculation in residency training.

This vulnerable population suffers from poor health conditions, many of which are surgically treatable. The recently released Lancet Commission on Global Surgery proposed a target capacity of 5,000 operations per 100,000 people annually by 2030 to meet the demands of the global burden of surgical disease. Based on this value, we sought to estimate the minimum surgical needs of refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and asylum seekers.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using the UNHCR database, the numbers of refugees, IDPs, and asylum seekers at the end of 2014 were identified. Data on the age and gender distribution of this population were also recorded. The numbers of displaced persons were categorized by the top countries of residence. Using the proposed annual minimum target of 5,000 operations per 100,000 population, the numbers of major surgical procedures needed per year were calculated.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:For the 59.5 million displaced persons, we calculated that at least 2.98 million operations are needed each year. The minimum numbers of surgeries required per year for the countries with the largest populations of displaced individuals include: Syria (397,000 surgeries), Colombia (302,000 surgeries), Iraq (201,000 surgeries), Democratic Republic of Congo (181,000 surgeries), and Pakistan (148,000 surgeries).  The numbers of displaced persons and estimated operations needed annually by category are shown in Table 1. Gender distribution for displaced individuals shows a nearly equal breakdown of males (50.2%) and females (49.8%). Additionally, 51% of refugees were children (age less than 18 years). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:An estimated minimum of nearly 3 million operations are required each year to meet the large surgical needs of refugees, IDPs, and asylum seekers. Obstetrical/gynecological and pediatric surgical expertise will likely be in high demand due to the large proportion of women and children among those displaced. Most displaced persons are hosted in countries with inadequate healthcare infrastructure and where surgical care is likely to fall short of the need. We recommend governments and non-governmental organizations consider these figures when providing humanitarian assistance and allocating resources. In addition, including surgical need with data collected on displaced persons can help the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of humanitarian surgery programs.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

These disparities can be partially attributed to scarce surgical, emergency response and trauma services. Evaluation of health facility surgical and trauma capacities aids in the identification and subsequent correction of deficiencies at each level of care. This study aimed to estimate the surgical and trauma care capacities of government health facilities in Nanakpur, a rural community of 40,000 people in Haryana, India, using a modified version of the Personnel, Infrastructure, Procedures, Equipment and Supplies (PIPES) tool, which includes additional questions from the International Assessment of Capacity for Trauma (INTACT) and Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Trauma Care (TSAAEESC) survey instruments.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In June 2015 the modified PIPES tool was administered to the eight government health facilities with at least one operating room in Nanakpur. Evaluated facilities included two primary health centers, one secondary-level community health center, four tertiary hospitals and one tertiary subspecialty hospital. At each location, a physician, hospital administrator or scrub nurse completed the survey, which evaluated personnel, infrastructure, procedures, equipment and supplies. Quantitative analyses were performed for each subsection and overall indices were calculated for PIPES and INTACT. Median scores were compared via Wilcoxon rank sum tests.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The eight facilities had a median of 250 beds (IQR 6.0-784.0), three general surgeons (IQR 0-15.0) and 2.5 anesthesiologists (IQR 0.5-22.5). No operative interventions were performed at the primary health centers and only selective surgical procedures (primarily C-sections and orthopedic procedures) were offered at the community health center. Median index scores were significantly higher for tertiary versus primary and community health centers: PIPES (10.667 vs. 4.19, p=0.03) and INTACT (9.25 vs. 3.75, p=0.03). The inconsistencies between the highest and two lower-levels of care were greatest in regards to personnel (15.0 vs. 0, p=0.02) and procedures (37.0 vs. 5.0, p=0.02), with general surgeons and non-obstetric abdominal surgery only available at four tertiary hospitals.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Through the use of a modified version of PIPES, information was gathered on the availability of elements necessary for the delivery of essential surgical and trauma care. The stark contrast between primary/community and tertiary health care facilities is most evident in personnel and procedures, reflecting the all-too-common shortage of available services at lower-level facilities. Ideally, these results will guide resource allocation to ultimately improve surgical and trauma capabilities at all facility levels, thereby providing this rural Indian population with equitable access to timely, quality care.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

Undetonated subunits frequently cause death and injury in civilians, mostly women and children. An international treaty banning the use of CM went into force in 2010; despite this, their use, though decreased, still continues. The goal of this study was to identify countries where civilians were most at risk of CM injuries and review the medical literature on CM as compared to research on landmine injuries.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data on CM injuries were obtained from the Cluster Munition Monitor database. Health care per capita data were obtained from the World Bank. Development and gender indices were obtained from the United Nations Human Development Reports. Two reviews of PubMed were conducted in August 2015, one using the search terms 'cluster munitions' and the other 'landmines.' <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Although global casualty estimates are as high as 55,000 for CM, from the 1960s through 2013, only a total of 19,419 CM casualties were documented. Approximately, 94% were civilian victims. In 2013, casualties from CM remnants were reported in ten countries: Cambodia, Croatia, Iraq, Lao PDR, Lebanon, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Vietnam, and Western Sahara.  A majority of the victims have been documented in four countries (Table 1). The literature review revealed only 10 papers on CM with the first written in 2003. Only 5 were research papers, the others were commentaries. For landmines, there were a total of 106 papers of which 38 were research papers dating back to the 1980s. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Despite an international treaty banning the use of CM, injuries to civilians commonly occur. The countries with the highest numbers of casualties have few health resources to care for their population and thus would benefit from improved surgical capacity. Unlike landmines, little research on CM injuries is described in the literature. Academic surgeons can contribute by: 1) joining with colleagues in affected countries to undertake research, and 2) raise awareness on the need to improve surgical and rehabilitation capabilities for injured victims located mostly in low-resource countries.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

The rates of major surgeries in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are much lower than those of more developed nations. Surveys at the community level provide a more accurate measure of unmet surgical need compared to facility-based surveys. This pilot study aimed to assess the local burden of surgical disease in a rural region of India through the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical need (SOSAS) population-based survey tool. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The study was undertaken between June and July 2015 in Nanakpur, Haryana. The region was divided into three sectors, with eight clusters each for sampling. Two clusters per sector were randomly selected for a total of 50 households (93 respondents) interviewed. The head of household provided demographic data, and surgical histories in six distinct anatomical regions were obtained from two household members. Questions were modified from the SOSAS survey to better capture distinct characteristics of Nanakpur's population. We defined current surgical need as a self-reported surgical problem present at the time of the interview and unmet surgical need as a surgical problem in which the respondent did not access care. Categorical and continuous variables were analyzed using Pearson's chi-squared and Kruskal Wallis tests, respectively. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:One hundred percent of households selected for the survey participated, with a total of 93 individuals and a median age of 35 years (IQR 26-50). Eighty-six percent were female, 59.1% literate and 23.7% employed. Twenty-eight individuals (30.1%; 95% CI: 21.0-40.5) indicated they had a current surgical need (body region: face 2, chest/breast 1, back 1, abdomen 3, groin/genitalia 4, extremities 17).  Those with a current surgical need had a higher median age (46.5 vs. 33 years, p=0.034) and lacked funds to travel to a tertiary center (64.3% vs. 32.4%, p=0.041). Once transport was available, the median travel time to a tertiary center was 60 minutes (IQR 45&ndash;90). Six individuals had an unmet surgical need (6.5%; 95% CI: 2.45-13.5).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The SOSAS tool has been used to estimate surgical needs at the population level in multiple regions across the globe. This pilot study, the first in India, highlights a significant burden of surgical disease in the remote area of Nanakpur. These data are useful preliminary evidence to highlight the urgent need to strengthen surgical systems in rural parts of India. Further studies should be conducted to better estimate the burden of surgical diseases throughout India, to accurately inform policymakers of the need to improve access to care.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

Uganda has two full-time clinical pediatric surgeons, and no physician anesthetists work outside the capital. A high burden of untreated pediatric surgical conditions exists in rural areas. Rural outreach with a primarily Ugandan team working with international collaborators was planned to improve surgical access.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Needs assessments were conducted in public regional hospitals in rural Soroti (east) and in Masaka (west). Collaborative objectives included 1) skills transfer to local clinicians; 2) reducing operative backlog; and 3) community sensitization to pediatric surgical conditions. Patient recruitment was done through local providers who screened cases before outreaches, in addition to public radio announcements. Visiting teams were composed of primarily Ugandan providers. All operations were done with mixed teams of surgical and anesthesia providers to facilitate skills transfer. Patient follow-up occurred both by host clinicians and through regular communication (phone and email), referral to the capital as needed, and return visits as needed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:One-week outreach trips were made to Soroti (5/2012, 1/2013) and Masaka (8/2013, 2/2015). 103 patients (median) were screened/outreach and 83 cases completed/outreach (median). All operations were done under general anesthesia with frequent use of regional blocks. All anesthesia and surgery was done by a combination of visiting team and host providers. The most common operations were hernia/hydrocele repair, orchiopexy, colostomy, PSARP/pull through, and hypospadias repair. There was one post-operative death from dehydration due to enteritis. There were three major complications: wound dehiscence requiring re-operation and two patients with prolonged extubation. All made a full recovery and were discharged uneventfully. Follow up for major cases such as PSARP and pull through were more commonly performed by the host team in Soroti, and through follow up in the capital, for the patients in Masaka (located closer to the capital).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Rural pediatric general surgery outreach can be performed safely in a very austere environment with primarily local providers. Preparatory planning with host clinicians, interdisciplinary teams, and careful case selection are essential for success. If skills transfer is a primary objective, joint participation in operations is important for hands-on experience of local clinicians. Longer-term follow-up, particularly for major cases, should be determined based on local personnel and practical barriers for follow up in the capital. Ongoing work will examine longer-term outcomes, impact, and cost-effectiveness of these programs.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

In India, trauma is the most frequent cause of death for Indians &lt;40 years, and 13-18% of all deaths are due to trauma. Trauma registries are an integral part of advanced trauma systems and have been shown to help reduce mortality in developed countries. Such registries are increasingly being implemented in LMICs. We conducted interviews with local stakeholders to identify barriers to registry implementation at Charutar Arogya Mandal (CAM) medical complex in Karamsad, Gujarat, India.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We conducted a 3-month pilot trauma registry to assess feasibility of a permanent registry for continuous trauma quality improvement at CAM where approximately 40% of emergency room patients are victims of trauma. The pilot consisted of a hardcopy registry form created in conjunction with key stakeholders at CAM. The form gathered basic demographic information, mechanism of injury, physiologic parameters, a brief description of injuries, outcome from emergency department and 2 week outcome for those admitted. Trauma Counselors (social workers) posted in the emergency department were responsible for filling out the forms with the assistance of Casualty Medical Officers (CMOs), surgical residents, and emergency room nurses.  Following the pilot phase we conducted 16 interviews with staff (5 CMOs, 3 surgery and orthopedic surgery residents, 4 trauma counselors, and 4 nurses) who were directly or indirectly involved with the pilot registry to gather qualitative data on challenges, barriers, and success to implementation. Interviews were conducted in English, audio recorded and transcribed for review. Inductive analysis was used to identify themes representing barriers to registry implementation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Only 19% of people interviewed had previous knowledge of a trauma registry prior to the pilot. All respondents saw benefits to having a trauma registry at the hospital and were willing to help contribute to a registry. 50% of respondents encountered some barrier to filling out the registry form, with the most commonly mentioned barrier being &lsquo;high patient volume.' &lsquo;Role in patient care' was also identified by 50% as a barrier with trauma counselors being less suited for data collection compared to CMOs and residents. 100% thought that incorporating the form into the official medical record and replacing existing paperwork would provide the greatest benefit and reduce &lsquo;duplication of effort.'<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Trauma registries are a centerpiece of sophisticated trauma systems. However, implementation of trauma registries in LMICs must take into account barriers that may be structure, process, financial, or personnel related. Interviews with staff involved in the pilot phase of trauma registry can provide important qualitative data for successful planning of the next steps for implementation.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

A reliable source of clean, running water should be considered essential when providing surgery. However, in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) this is not the case. A lack of data for advocacy hinders efforts to improve water infrastructure. The goal of this study was to review the surgical capacity literature and document the availability of water at healthcare facilities.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search of PubMed for all reports of surgical capacity in LMICs was performed in July 2015. Additionally, references from these reports were examined for potentially useful records. Data were abstracted for studies that reported access to water at health facilities using one of three assessment tools: (a) Surgeons OverSeas Personnel, Infrastructure, Procedure, Equipment and Supplies (PIPES), (b) WHO Emergency and Essential Surgical Care, and (c) Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. When multiple studies assessing surgical capacity in a given country were available, the one with the largest number of facilities assessed was used.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 72 paper identified, 19 were published between 2008 and 2015 included for analysis.

We hypothesize that quantifying these variables will reveal trends influencing choice of medical specialty. Our goal is to ascertain trends and factors that can be used to increase interest in surgery, and attract students to pursue a surgical career.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A questionnaire-based, longitudinal prospective study was conducted at a university program. Surveys were administered to medical students in the class of 2017 prior to the start of the first, second, and third years. The questions cover topics including specialty preferences, debt, mentorship, research, and factors deemed desirable or important in a future career. Residency choices were classified as surgical and nonsurgical. Z-tests for population proportions and odds ratios were calculated using SAS/STAT software.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Data was collected from 143, 139, and 144 students at the beginning of their first, second, and third medical school year, respectively, and response rates were &gt;90%. Students with any research experience prior to medical school were 64% less likely (p=0.016) to have surgical career interests in the first survey. By the third year, however, students expressing interest in surgery were 2.5 times more likely to be actively involved in research (p=0.029) and 8.4 times more likely to have a surgery-related research focus (p=0.0001), as compared to non-surgery classmates. At the beginning of their third year, students with an interest in surgical specialties were 2.2 times more likely to have a self-maintained surgeon-mentor relationship (p=0.031), as compared to students interested in non-surgical specialties. With near significance, students initially expressing interest in surgical specialties are 2.4 times more likely to change their interest to 'undecided' in future surveys (p=0.06). Students without both research experience and active surgeon-mentor relationships are 9 times more likely to switch to 'undecided' or non-surgical specialties (0.02619). Furthermore, students involved in research, but without a mentor, are 20 times more likely to change their interests to 'undecided' or non-surgical specialties (p=0.0012), compared to those with both research and active surgeon-mentor relationships.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Students involved in surgery-specific research are significantly more likely to continue expressing interest in a surgical career if they have a mentor. In the absence of a mentor, students involved in research are more likely to change interests than those not involved in research at all. Our preliminary conclusion is that while research attracts students to consider surgical specialties, meaningful surgeon-mentor relationships are essential to maintain a student's interest.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Brown<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Texas Medical Branch,Galveston, TX, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The American Board of Surgery requires a minimum of 750 procedures as operating surgeon for certification, using volume as a proxy for competence. The milestones framework is based on competency assessment instead of volume, but still relies on a determination that a resident performs many or all of a given set of operations. In both of these models, there is no definition as to what constitutes a resident acting as operating surgeon or performing a given operation, so this determination relies on either resident or faculty perception. Our hypothesis is that there is poor concordance between the perceptions of surgeons and residents participating in the same operation as to whether the resident acted as operating surgeon, and what percent of the operation the resident performed. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Resident and faculty volunteers were separately queried immediately following cases. Both residents and faculty answered questions regarding their perception as to the 3 key components of the case, how many of the key components were performed by the resident, what percent of the case was performed by the resident, and how they would define the resident's role in the case. Responses were analyzed both by case as well as in aggregate. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Resident-faculty responses were collected for 87 cases. Concurrence between residents and faculty as to the 3 critical components of a case occurred in only 20% of cases(17/87). Faculty and resident agreement on the resident's role in a case occurred only 63% of the time (55/87 cases) and on the percentage of a case performed by resident only 61% of the time (53/87). Total agreement between residents and faculty with regard to resident role, percentage performed, and number of key components performed in the case was found in only 36% of the cases (31/87). Sixty five percent (22/34) of discordance in percentage participation was related to residents perceiving they did more of a case than the faculty thought they did. Faculty &lt;10 years post training were more likely to disagree with resident perceptions compared to faculty with &gt;10 years post training (47% vs 19%, p&lt;0.0001, chi-square). In cases where there was agreement on percentage of case performed, 77%(41/53) agreed on resident role. Across all cases, assigning the role of first assist was associated with the perception that the resident performed &lt;50% of the procedure by 88.2% of residents and 92.3% of faculty; the role of surgeon junior was associated with performing &gt;50% of the procedure in 79.2% of residents and 85.1% of faculty, and surgeon chief with &gt;50% of the procedure in 76.4% of residents and 71.4% of faculty. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:We observed a high degree of discordance between faculty and residents in identifying the key components of a case, percentage of the case performed by a resident, and the resident's role in the case. As we move into the milestones era, improved understanding of this discordance is necessary to identify potential interventions to improve training and valid assessment.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

A complete closed loop communication consists of a call out (CO), call back (CB), and confirmation (CONF). These non-technical skills are taught to increase reliability of information exchange among surgical team members. COs directed to a specific team member may be more effective in eliciting a CB and subsequent action than non-directed COs. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of directed and non-directed COs on closed loop communication in a simulated surgical recovery room scenario.  <br><br><strong>Method</strong>:  We performed an observational study analyzing video recordings of eight surgical teams managing a simulated code of a surgical patient in the Post-Acute Care Unit. Each team consisted of six members (two each of surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses). Progression of the simulation was standardized for each team. Each CO was coded and classified as either &lsquo;directed' (defined as targeting communication to a specific team member using one of name, role, mutual eye contact or physical contact) or &lsquo;non-directed' (defined as not targeting communication to a specific team member). The primary outcome measure was CB. As a secondary outcome, we assessed whether the CB was followed by a CONF. Videos were analyzed using a standardized data capture form.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We reviewed 48 clinicians (16 surgeons) in 8 scenarios.  A total of 728 COs were identified (mean 91 per team). The COs were evenly divided, with 50% directed and 50% non-directed. 462 COs (63%) elicited a CB. The likelihood of receiving a CB was significantly greater for directed (88%) vs non-directed (38%) communication (p&lt;.01). Using names elicited a slightly higher chance of CB (85%) than other forms of directed communication (78%), but this difference was not significant. A total of 98 (20%) of 462 CBs resulted in a CONF.  Overall, closed loop communication only occurred 13% of the time (96 of 728 events), with directed COs more likely than non-directed COs to result in this (74% vs 25%, p&lt;.01). See figure 1.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Directed communication was significantly more effective than non-directed communication in eliciting a response from a team member during a surgical emergency. Although rare, closed loop communications were more likely when initiated by a directed communication. The next phase of research is to measure impact of these communication strategies on clinically relevant outcomes.","Education","Simulation Training (Technical and Non-technical)","Cross Disciplinary"

Previous studies report high rates of burnout amongst all-comers to medical residency and surgical subspecialties, but there is limited data on burnout in general surgery trainees and systematic differences based on gender in this group.  We report results of a survey of residents, examining the effect of gender on burnout during general surgery training.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Following IRB approval, from April-December, 2014, we asked program directors of all ACGME-accredited general surgery programs to email their general surgery residents inviting them to complete an anonymous, online survey.  We measured demographics and program characteristics.  Burnout was assessed with Maslach's Burnout Inventory (MBI); we calculated scores for Emotional Exhaustion (EE), Depersonalization (DP), and Personal Accomplishment (PA).  Higher scores on EE and DP and lower scores on PA indicate greater burnout. Chi-square tests were used to analyze categorical data.  Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to measure differences by gender, personal relationship status, and career plans, adjusting for confounders, including number of children, age, and work hours; two-tailed p-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Of 753 respondents, 588 residents engaged in clinical training had complete data for analysis. The average age of the study sample was 30 years old; 56% of respondents were male and 44% were female. Overall, 67% of residents reported being burned out, scoring in the highest tertile of EE or DP, or in the lowest tertile of PA (based on data from Maslach's normative sample).  Women were significantly more likely than men to report burnout as defined above (73.4% vs. 63.2%, p&lt;0.05).  A greater proportion of women than men scored in the highest tertile of EE (66.8% vs. 48.9%) and lowest tertile of PA (51.7% vs. 39.8%, each p&lt;0.05).  Women also were more likely to have considered dropping out of residency (51.9% vs. 37.2%, p&lt;0.001).  ANCOVA demonstrated a significant interaction between gender and relationship status for EE and DP (each p&lt;0.05).  Men who were married or in a committed relationship reported lower levels of EE and DP compared to single men, while women who were married or in a committed relationship reported higher levels of EE and DP compared to single women.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  General surgery residents reported high levels of burnout irrespective of gender and women are more burned out than men. While relationships were protective in men, they appeared to exacerbate burnout in women. The observed gender differences in burnout and the gender-by-relationship status interaction suggest that a catch-all approach to interventions to mitigate burnout may be insufficient and efforts may need to account for specific challenges that differ by gender.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Pugh<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin,Department Of Surgery,Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Although nurses perform a majority of urinary bladder catheterizations in the hospital, physicians are called on for more difficult catheter placements. Errors committed during urethral catheterizations are shown to contribute to the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, which are currently the number one hospital-acquired infection in the United States (2). The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the number of errors committed by residents during a urinary bladder catheterization procedure and their self-assessment scores. We hypothesize that residents will be overly confident in their abilities and underestimate the potential for case complexity.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  PGY 2-4 surgery residents (n=45) had 45 minutes to complete three of four bladder catheterization simulations as part of a larger study. The simulations represented well-known clinical scenarios: a female trauma patient, a female post-op patient, a male with a partial urethral blockage, and a male with a full urethral blockage. Participants were given the option to place a urology consult at any point in the simulation. One investigator reviewed videos of each procedure and evaluated procedure performance using the ACS/APDS Technical Skills Curriculum (1). Pre- and post-simulation participants rated the perceived procedure difficulty and their personal confidence level using a 5-point Likert scale. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to look for predictors of procedure performance. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Participants made a total of 348 errors with an average of 7.73 errors (SD=3.16) per participant. The lower the resident's pre-simulation confidence in problem-solving, the more errors they committed during the simulation (beta=-1.91,t=-3.89, p=.001). Participants that predicted less difficulty in problem solving for the catheter insertion also made more errors during the experiment (beta=-.452, t=-3.109, p=.004). Average pre-simulation confidence was 4.42 out of 5, while average post-simulation confidence was 3.56 out of 5. There was no correlation between post-simulation confidence level and total errors (p&gt;.05). Participants with higher pre-simulation confidence in problem solving abilities took less time before deciding to place a urology consult (beta=-1.53, t=-4.32, p=.001). Those who placed a urology consult during the simulation were less confident about problem solving (F(1,42)=6.16, p=.017). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The residents did not perform as well as they anticipated when presented with more complicated bladder catheterization scenarios. Simulation can be used to identify and expose potential errors that may occur during complex presentations of basic procedures.

This study examined how well first-year surgery residents' patient prioritizations align with faculty expectations after an orientation/boot camp and approximately four months of residency training.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: From 2011-2014, intern classes participated in an 8-week 'bootcamp' on critical issues in surgery and completed a prioritization instrument during the fall.   Interns were placed in the role of a night-float resident physician and given 10 patient scenarios with a variety of clinical urgencies (e.g., septic shock to room change requests).  Interns were asked to rank patients/problems in the order they should be addressed.  In 2014, surgery interns at a collaborating institution also completed the survey.  General surgery attending physicians also ranked patients in the order they would prefer residents to address the scenarios.Concordance between interns' and faculty rankings was assessed using Kendall's W.  Agreement among faculty was indexed with the intra-class correlation coefficient.  Average faculty rank was calculated for each scenario and a deviation from the faculty average was calculated for each intern on each case. Ten deviation scores were averaged for each intern. Differences between cohorts of interns were evaluated with an analysis of variance. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Data was collected from 51 interns from our institution in the 2011-2014 classes (response rate=57%), 16 attendings (response rate=94%), and 5 interns (response rate=63%) from the collaborating institution.  Agreement among faculty was high (ICC=0.79).  Our interns had a significantly higher concordance with faculty ranks than with interns from the collaborating institution (0.99 vs. 0.89; z=1.59, p=0.05). Concordance of intern ranks from the two institutions was 0.88.  There was no statistical difference between intern classes from 2011 to 2014 (1.12 vs. 1.34 vs. 1.13 vs. 1.35).Scenarios with highest agreement between our interns and faculty were about acute changes in patient clinical condition.  Scenarios with the lowest agreement were about communication: one with a patient requesting a new room and the other a nurse who is worried about possible post-operative bleeding.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Focused teaching of urgent issues and clinical thinking may help develop clinical reasoning and prioritization skills.  This prioritization instrument may be useful in evaluating early competence and identifying residents in need of remediation.  Future research will assess if prioritization skill is predictive of overall intern performance and can be improved in residents who are discordant from faculty scores.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Rab27a is a GTPase that has been shown to promote exosome secretion. However, mechanisms controlling cell exosome secretion in response to pathologic conditions are not well-defined. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor regulating immunity, carcinogenesis, and hepatic I/R injury. The role of IRF-1 in regulating Rab27a and exosome secretion is unknown. Since IRF-1 can regulate expression of some GTPases, we hypothesized that IRF-1 might regulate Rab27a expression and increase exosome secretion.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Primary human hepatocytes (hHC) and human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 were treated with Interferon-&gamma; (IFN&gamma;).  PCR and Western blot were used to detect IRF-1 and Rab27a mRNA and proteins. Exosomes secreted by hHC and Huh-7 cells were isolated with ultracentrifugation. Isolated exosomes were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and surface markers.  Exosome proteins secreted by these cells were quantitated with bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA). The sizes of the exosomes were measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The binding sites of IRF-1 in promoter region of Rab27a were predicted with PROMO bioinformatics software. IRF-1 expression plasmid and Rab27a promoter-driven luciferase reporter were used to determine the effect of IRF-1 on Rab27a transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were used to verify IRF-l binding in the Rab27a gene promoter region in vivo and in vitro.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: IFN&gamma; increased IRF-1 and Rab27a mRNA and protein in primary hHC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. A). Deflated soccer-ball like exosomes, which were verified by TEM (Fig. B), were secreted more by hHC and Huh7 after IFN&gamma; treatment (Fig. C, p &lt; 0.05).  IFN&gamma; did not alter the exosome size (data not shown). Multi-vesicle bodies (MVB) are precursors of exosomes and were markedly increased by IFN&gamma; stimulation in Huh7 cells (Fig. D, CD63 staining red).  Transfection of HepG2 cells with IRF-1 expression plasmid increased Rab27a promoter activity 4.9-fold. Using PROMO software, we found ten putative IRF-1 binding motifs upstream in the Rab27a promoter region. ChIP and EMSA verified five IRF-1 binding sites in the Rab27a promoter region (data not shown).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These novel findings indicate that IFN&gamma; induces IRF-1 which promotes exosome secretion through increasing the expression of Rab27a. These results provide important insights into fundamental cellular signaling pathways regulating exosome secretion under inflammatory conditions in hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Despite great efforts, we have been unable to effectively target KRAS and it is felt that Ras proteins are 'undruggable'. We now propose a novel approach to overcome this resistance by targeting MEK and CDK 4/6, two key downstream effectors of KRAS.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Expression of Retinoblastoma (Rb) and ERK protein levels in KRAS wild-type and mutant human PDAC cell lines was determined at baseline and with MEK (MEK162) and/or CDK4 (LEE011) inhibition. The effects of combined therapy on cell-cycle progression, colony formation, and invasion were determined. Ptf1a<sup>cre/+</sup>;LSL-Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>;Tgfbr2<sup>flox/flox</sup> (PKT) mice were treated with CDK4/6 and MEK inhibition and transcriptomic profiles were obtained by performing RNAseq on PKT mouse tumors after 2 weeks of treatment with vehicle, LEE011, MEK162, or the combination in addition to wild type Ptf1a<sup>cre/+</sup>;LSL-Kras<sup>WT/WT</sup>;Tgfbr2<sup>flox/flox</sup>. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using baySeq, DESeq2, and EdgeR in a pairwise fashion, and the lists of genes were inputted into WebGestalt (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/) for pathway enrichment analysis using gene ontology (GO), KEGG, and Wikipathways. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to predict therapeutic targets and assess therapeutic response.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 effectively inhibits phosphorylation of Rb in PDAC cell lines.  Combined inhibition of CDK4/6 and MEK decreases pRB and pMAPK expression, delays cell cycle progression, decreases colony formation, and decreases invasion in the KRAS mutant cell lines. GSEA of wild type mouse pancreata vs. control mouse tumor revealed significant upregulation in the MYC targeted pathway, a key regulator of Ras mediated therapeutic resistance. Overall survival (OS) in PKT mice treated with MEK162 or LEE011 alone was not significantly different compared to controls, but mice receiving combined CDK4/6 and MEK inhibition exhibited a 400% increase in OS (59 vs. 251.5 days). Combined CDK4/6 and MEK inhibition significantly downregulated IL-6/STAT3, Kras, EMT, and IL-2/STAT5 related pathways compared with control mice. Combination treated mice also had significant downregulation in IL-6/STAT3 signaling compared to MEK treated mice.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:Targeting KRAS in PDAC through downstream inhibition of MEK remains ineffective due to upregulation of STAT3 signaling. Targeting two key downstream effectors of KRAS signaling with combined inhibition of CDK4/6 and MEK overcomes STAT3 mediated chemoresistance and results in significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy in the aggressive PKT genetic mouse model of PDAC.","Basic Science","Cancer Genetics","Oncology"

Given the critical role of monocyte/macrophage biology in vascular pathology, we hypothesize that early perturbations in monocyte function are important determinants of vein graft outcomes. The current study was undertaken to uncover the time-dependent changes in monocyte gene expression following vein grafting and identify key regulatory elements implicated in graft failure.   <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In 48 patients undergoing lower extremity vein bypass grafting, blood monocytes were isolated pre-operatively and at 1, 7 and 28 days post-op. Gene expression was determined using an Affymetrix human microarray coded for 20,213 genes. Duplex scans were performed at 1 week and 1, 6 and 12 months post-op and, in conjunction with physical exam, were used to determine major adverse limb events (stenosis, occlusion or re-intervention) and define graft success or failure at 1 year.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Mixed effects modeling demonstrated time to be the dominant influence on gene expression, with 1870 genes changing over time and no genes showing a difference between outcome groups (FDR&lt;.001, Fig 1A). To investigate the potential that underlying this broad response to surgical trauma is a key set of genes that are critical drivers of the vein graft phenotype, a custom clustering algorithm was used to identify 50 unique, time-dependent signature patterns. Stringent selection criteria (p&lt;.05, effect size &gt;0.5 and fold change &gt;1.4) identified 3 of these 50 clusters (n=64 genes) which showed markedly different levels of gene expression between successful and failed grafts. Common to these genes was a heightened early (Day1) response in those grafts that went on to failure (p&lt;.001) (Fig 1B). Pathway analysis of this gene set identified eight additional genes as the dominant regulatory elements whose expression levels were dynamic and varied substantially between outcome groups (Fig 1C). Ontology analysis revealed this to be a set of highly-interconnected regulatory genes with central roles in inflammation, cell growth, angiogenesis and neutrophil proliferation.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Following vein grafting there is a significant time-dependent perturbation in monocyte gene expression. Embedded within these changes is a key set of 64 genes that are highly associated with success or failure of the vein graft.

Here, we investigate a potential role of the ceramide/sphingosine axis in increased susceptibility. Ceramide levels are regulated by acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) activity that converts the membrane phospholipid sphingomyelin to ceramide. Subsequently, ceramide is hydrolyzed via acid ceramidase to the long chain base, sphingosine. Beyond its cellular localization, sphingosine can be observed extracellularly in microparticles (MPs). Although it is known that sphingosine treatment can be used to combat infection, the role of cellular sphingosine or sphingosine-containing MPs in the defense against pulmonary infection in burn patients has not been elucidated. Altogether, we hypothesize that 1) injury alters Asm activity and subsequently sphingosine levels such that susceptibility to infection is increased and 2) sphingosine treatment will prevent lung PA infection in burn injured mice.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Outbred mice were subjected to a dorsal 28% total body surface area, full thickness scald injury. First, we characterized sphingosine expression in the lungs (by immunohistochemistry) and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) derived MPs (by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis) on post burn day one (PBD1). Second, Asm activity and MP numbers were determined in BAL fluid in mice 24 hours following inoculation with PA. Finally, to determine the effects of sphingosine on infection, some PBD1 mice were pre-treated with sphingosine. All mice were then inoculated with PA and four hours later, colony forming units (CFUs) were enumerated.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Similar to what is seen clinically, infected burn-injured mice had increased mortality as compared to infected uninjured mice (50.0% vs 18.2%, p=0.048). To determine underlying mechanisms of this mortality, we first observed on PBD1, there is a four-fold reduction in bronchial epithelial sphingosine expression in burn injured mice compared to sham. Further, these mice have a significant reduction in total MPs in BAL fluid. Secondly, there was a significant reduction in Asm activity and total MPs in BAL fluid in infected burn mice compared to infected uninjured mice. The BAL MPs from burn infected mice have significantly reduced sphingosine expression. Finally, following PA inoculation, burn mice have a three-log increase in pulmonary infection compared to sham. However, when burn mice are treated with inhaled sphingosine prior to inoculation, there is a significant reduction in pulmonary infection to a level similar to control mice.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The data demonstrate that 1) burn decreases bronchial sphingosine levels and MP numbers, 2) upon infection, injured mice have decreased Asm activity and MP sphingosine levels, and 3) sphingosine treatment prevents lung infection of PA in burn injured mice. These data suggest that in burn patients, treatment with sphingosine will reduce subsequent pulmonary infection.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Trauma/Critical Care"

Burn-induced gut barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation is thought to be one of the sources of bacterial presence in the blood stream. Previously, we have shown that IAP detoxifies bacterial pro-inflammatory factors, prevents endotoxemia, enhances gut barrier functions, and preserves intestinal microbial homeostasis. We have hypothesized that supplemental intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) could be used as a therapeutic modality to prevent gut-derived sepsis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 6-week old CD-1 mice were divided into 4 groups (n=5 in each group). We inflicted a 30% total body surface area burn on the back of mice +/- intradermal Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection mid-eschar of burn site to induce gut barrier dysfunction. IAP or vehicle were administered orally by gastric gavage in a dose of 200U per gavage at 3 and 12 hours post infection. The results were compared to a non-burned control group that underwent a sham procedure. The change in intestinal permeability was assessed by measuring FITC-Dextran 20kD presence in the blood stream at 6 hours post gavage. Bacterial burden in the blood and in intestinal samples was assessed. Intestinal inflammation and cytokine levels were also measured using ELISA.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:TThe experimental group underwent the burn procedure and infection had significantly higher intestinal permeability to FITC-Dextran compared to burn alone or control group mice. (p = 0.01) Oral IAP supplementation significantly reduced the gut barrier dysfunction seen in the treated group. (FITC-Dextran concentration in blood: 0.255 &micro;g/ml in infected group compared to 0.074 &micro;g/ml in IAP treated group, p = 0.04) Consistently, infected mice showed significantly lower serum endotoxin levels in IAP-treated group (2.69 &plusmn; 0.60 EU/ml) compared to infected and no treated group (17.51 &plusmn; 6.14 EU/ml, p = 0.003). IAP treatment reduced the bacterial load in the blood of burn and infected mice (6.3 x 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml of blood in infected group compared to 4.2 x 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/ml in IAP treated infected mice) and in the ileal tissue (1.4 x 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/g of ileal tissue in infection group compared to vs 2.8 x 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/g in IAP group, p = 0.049). Lastly, the burn procedure combined with infection resulted in significant levels of intestinal inflammation, as evidenced by elevated levels of TNF-a in the intestinal tissue. IAP treatment reduced TNF-a level.   <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:IAP is a major regulator of the gut mucosal barrier and is able to ameliorate burn-induced gut barrier dysfunction. It appears that IAP functions through preventing intestinal inflammation. Oral IAP supplementation may represent a novel approach to prevent sepsis in burn patients.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

Our lab has previously demonstrated the critical role that the innate immune receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and subsequent exaggerated inflammatory signaling play in the pathogenesis of NEC and intestinal necrosis. Intracellular serpin B3 has been identified as a pro-survival factor with a novel role in necrosis inhibition. Given the characteristic necrosis observed in NEC, we hypothesized that TLR4 signaling in the gut plays a role in the regulation of intracellular serpin expression.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Under IRB approval, intestinal samples were obtained from patients diagnosed with NEC and evaluated for the expression of serpin B3 by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The role of TLR4 was determined using a model of endotoxemia (LPS 1mg/kg IP 3 h) or experimental NEC in neonatal (7 &ndash; 12 day old) C57Bl/6, TLR4 KO or mice lacking TLR4 in the intestinal epithelium (TLR4<sup>&Delta;IEC</sup>). NEC was induced by feeding formula supplemented with bacteria isolated from human NEC via gavage five times/day and exposure to hypoxia (5%O<sub>2</sub>, 95%N<sub>2</sub>) for 10 min in a hypoxic chamber twice daily for 4 days. TLR4 and serpin B3 deficient enterocytes (IEC-6 cells) were generated using lentivirus-TLR4-shRNA or lentivirus-serpin B3-shRNA, respectively. The role of serpin B3 in the inflammatory response of enterocytes challenged with LPS was evaluated by IL-6, iNOS and IL-1b mRNA expression determined by qRT-PCR.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Human and murine NEC intestinal samples display a significantly increased expression of serpin B3 by mRNA (58 fold and 6 fold, respectively) and evidenced by IHC. These findings were determined to be TLR4-dependent, since serpin B3 expression was significantly lower in TLR4-deficient enterocytes compared to wild-type controls (0.16 vs. 8 fold relative to actin) when challenged with endotoxin. These results are further supported by the fact that endotoxemia leads to upregulation of serpin B3 in wild-type mice (2 fold) but have no effect on TLR4 deficient mice. Moreover, TLR4<sup>&Delta;IEC</sup> mice were protected from developing NEC and had decreased levels of serpin B3. Strikingly, when compared to wild-type IEC-6 cells exposed to LPS, serpin B3-deficient cells were found to have increased expression of the inflammatory mediators iNOS (4 fold), IL-6 (2 fold) and IL-1b (3 fold).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Intracellular serpin B3 levels are significantly increased in the intestine of both human and murine NEC. Normal TLR4 expression in the intestinal epithelium is required for serpin B3 expression. Our findings suggest a potential role for TLR4 regulation of serpin B3, a molecular modulator of intestinal inflammation and necrosis, hallmarks of this devastating disease.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

We hypothesize that quantifying these variables will reveal trends influencing choice of medical specialty. Our goal is to ascertain trends and factors that can be used to increase interest in surgery, and attract students to pursue a surgical career.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A questionnaire-based, longitudinal prospective study was conducted at a university program. Surveys were administered to medical students in the class of 2017 prior to the start of the first, second, and third years. The questions cover topics including specialty preferences, debt, mentorship, research, and factors deemed desirable or important in a future career. Residency choices were classified as surgical and nonsurgical. Z-tests for population proportions and odds ratios were calculated using SAS/STAT software.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Data was collected from 143, 139, and 144 students at the beginning of their first, second, and third medical school year, respectively, and response rates were &gt;90%. Students with any research experience prior to medical school were 64% less likely (p=0.016) to have surgical career interests in the first survey. By the third year, however, students expressing interest in surgery were 2.5 times more likely to be actively involved in research (p=0.029) and 8.4 times more likely to have a surgery-related research focus (p=0.0001), as compared to non-surgery classmates. At the beginning of their third year, students with an interest in surgical specialties were 2.2 times more likely to have a self-maintained surgeon-mentor relationship (p=0.031), as compared to students interested in non-surgical specialties. With near significance, students initially expressing interest in surgical specialties are 2.4 times more likely to change their interest to 'undecided' in future surveys (p=0.06). Students without both research experience and active surgeon-mentor relationships are 9 times more likely to switch to 'undecided' or non-surgical specialties (0.02619). Furthermore, students involved in research, but without a mentor, are 20 times more likely to change their interests to 'undecided' or non-surgical specialties (p=0.0012), compared to those with both research and active surgeon-mentor relationships.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Students involved in surgery-specific research are significantly more likely to continue expressing interest in a surgical career if they have a mentor. In the absence of a mentor, students involved in research are more likely to change interests than those not involved in research at all.

The optimal treatment for hemorrhagic shock is to reverse circulatory losses, metabolic acidosis, and cellular hypoxia with blood products, but these are often not available for immediate administration.  Alternative approaches to initial resuscitation are needed, especially in resource poor environments.  Amitriptyline is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effects.  We have previously demonstrated that treatment of blood products with amitriptyline leads to decreased lung injury after hemorrhage, but the direct effect of amitriptyline in treatment of hemorrhage is unknown.  We hypothesized that administration of amitriptyline after trauma and hemorrhage would improve survival in a non-resuscitation injury model.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Healthy C57/BL6 male mice underwent laparotomy to induce tissue trauma and hemorrhage via femoral artery cannulation to a mean arterial pressure of 25&plusmn;5mmHg for 60 minutes. After laparotomy closure and decannulation, mice received amitriptyline (0.1 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of vehicle (50 uL of normal saline) via intraperitoneal injection. For survival analysis, mice underwent the above treatment (n=10/group) and were monitored for 24 hours. For hemodynamic and blood chemistry analysis, mice (n=5/group) underwent the same injuries and treatments as described above and were sacrificed 60 minutes after treatment. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Administration of amitriptyline after trauma and hemorrhage significantly increased 24-hour survival in mice (Figure 1; 70% survival with amitriptyline vs 0% with vehicle; p&lt;0.001).

We hypothesize that sarcopenia, as measured by preoperative CT scans of the psoas muscle, predicts mortality and morbidity in emergent laparotomy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Institutional NSQIP data were queried for adult patients who underwent open emergency abdominal surgery between 2008 and 2013. Patient demographics, clinical variables, and outcomes were extracted from NSQIP. Patients with abdominal CT scans within 30 days prior to surgery were included and the cross sectional areas of the psoas muscles at vertebral level L4 were summed and normalized by patient height. Patients were assigned to sex-stratified tertiles based on this normalized total psoas area (TPA) for analysis, with the lowest tertile being classified as sarcopenic. Kaplan Meier curves were constructed to compare survival between TPA tertiles. Cox Proportional Hazards models stratified by sex and controlling for ASA score, ascites, International Normalized Ratio (INR), functional dependency and work Relative Value Units as a proxy for surgery complexity were used to evaluate the influence of TPA on postoperative mortality.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: NSQIP revealed 781 patients undergoing emergent open abdominal surgery and 593 of these (75.9%) had appropriate preoperative CT scans. Median patient age was 61 years (IQR 50-72), median TPA was 1719 mm<sup>2</sup> (IQR 1341-2293), and median BMI was 26.7kg/m<sup>2</sup> (22.9-33). Bivariable analysis demonstrated that TPA was significantly associated with total postoperative morbidity (p=0.013), increased length of stay (p&lt;0.0001) and 90-day mortality (p=0.0008) but not 30-day mortality (p=0.26). Kaplan Meier curves demonstrated significantly decreased 90-day survival in lowest TPA tertile. A Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that the impact of TPA was overwhelmed by previously validated predictors of mortality, most notably ASA score.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Sarcopenia, as measured by TPA, is significantly associated with increased 90-day mortality, length of stay, and total morbidity in patients undergoing open emergency abdominal surgery. Since many patients undergoing emergent abdominal surgery have already undergone CT scanning, TPA is readily available to the practicing surgeon at no added risk or cost. As such, sarcopenia is a convenient additional tool for preoperative risk assessment and risk counseling.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

A large percentage of donor livers have significant steatosis. Previous research suggests improvement in steatosis in the immediate post-transplant period. This study compares reperfusion and early post-transplant surveillance biopsies, and correlates the results with initial graft function and long-term outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Records of all liver transplants (LTs) performed at a single center over a 14-year period were reviewed. The original biopsies were reviewed by experienced liver pathologists. Liver biopsies are obtained at the time of transplant and 3 days after transplant. Total steatosis is calculated as the sum of both micro- and macrovesicular steatosis, and is categorized into four study groups:  (1) none (0%), (2) mild (&lt;10%), (3) moderate (10-20%) and (4) severe (&gt;20%). For this analysis, change in liver steatosis is calculated as moving from one study group to another. Early post transplant liver function is assessed by biochemical analysis of liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT); liver injury), total bilirubin (TB; excretion), international normalized ratio (INR; synthesis).  Long-term survival is assessed using Cox regression analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Data were available for 1572 adult subjects. Among the patients with steatosis, there was a significant and rapid decrease in steatosis. The median group change was greatest for severe steatosis groups (Group 3, &gt;20%: -1.54; Group 2, 10 to 20%: -0.93; Group 1, 1 to 10%: -0.47 (p&lt;0.001). Moderate and severe steatosis was associated with more acute liver injury (p&lt;0.05 for days 1 to 6), and delayed graft function (higher TB and INR (p&lt;0.05 on days 1, 3)). These values decreased for all study groups until they were similar by day 7 (ALT) and day 14 (TB and INR). Systemically, steatotic groups demonstrated an acute decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 1 to 3 days post transplant, ranging from -12 to -22% change, compared to only a -5% change for the nonsteatotic group. Graft survival was worse at all time periods for moderate and severe steatosis livers. Subgroup analysis was employed to identify groups that have a more dynamic decrease in steatosis. Those groups with better clearance of severe steatosis included recipients who were younger, more obese, male, and those with fatty liver disease.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:These results confirm a marked post-transplant decrease in allograft steatosis that occurs within 3 days of transplant. Subgroup analysis suggests that younger male patients who are obese or have fatty liver disease are more able to clear steatosis in this period. Allografts with moderate to severe steatosis have worse early injury, delayed graft function and worse early and late survival. Steatotic grafts are associated with a substantial acute decrease in renal function early post transplant.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Given the widespread use of ACS NSQIP in research and recent calls for it to become a platform for national public reporting and pay-for-performance initiatives, it is important to understand which types of hospitals elect to participate in the program. Our objective was to compare the characteristics of ACS NSQIP-participating hospitals to non-participating hospitals in the United States.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using the 2013 American Hospital Association data on hospital characteristics, hospitals participating in ACS NSQIP were compared to non-participating hospitals. The 2013 Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) dataset was used to calculate hospital operating margin as a measure of financial health. The CMS 2013 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Final Rule Impact File was used to abstract the Medicare and Medicaid Services Value Based Purchasing (VBP) and Disproportionate Share adjustment scores, which were used as proxies for hospital quality and patient population, respectively.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 3,872 total U.S. general medical and surgical hospitals, 475 (12.3%) participated in ACS NSQIP. ACS NSQIP hospitals performed 29.0% of operations in the U.S, with a slightly greater share of inpatient operations (32.4%) and a smaller share of outpatient operations (27.1%). Compared to non-participating hospitals, ACS NSQIP hospitals had a higher mean annual inpatient surgical case volume (6,426 vs 1,874; p&lt;0.001), a larger number of hospital beds (420 vs 167; p&lt;0.001), were more often academic affiliates (35.2% vs 4.1%; p&lt;0.001), were more often accredited by JCAHO and CoC (p&lt;0.001), and had higher mean operating margins (p&lt;0.05).

It is traditionally diagnosed with a combination of physical examination and plain radiographs of the abdomen. The diagnostic role for ultrasound in NEC is uncertain. We hypothesized that ultrasound (US) is as sensitive as plain radiographs in the diagnosis and management of NEC.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The medical records of all infants with NEC in a single pediatric tertiary center from January 2006- January 2013 were reviewed. In order to factor in NEC's rapid rate of changes in pathologic findings, patients that underwent US within four hours of abdominal XR were included in the analysis. Bell's Criteria were utilized to stage each patient during his/her course. Clinical, radiologic, surgical and pathological findings were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed using Student&#39;s t-test and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and Fisher&#39;s exact for categorical variables.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:During this period, 186 neonates were diagnosed with NEC, of which 26 met inclusion criteria. It was noted that US was done for confirmatory purposes in these 26 patients after plain radiographs did not agree with clinical findings.  Plain radiographs and ultrasound were taken within an average of 2.46 &plusmn; 1.17 hrs of each other. At the time of XR and US, the Bell's staging of the patients was Stage 1 in 27% of the cases (n=7), Stage 2 in 42% (n=11), and Stage 3 in 31% (n=8). There were 92% preterm infants, 38.5% had congenital anomalies (i.e. omphalocele, congenital neck mass, and Congenital High Airway Obstruction Syndrome), 19% had cardiac abnormalities, and 23% had patent ductus arteriosus. The survival rate of our NEC population was 65% (n=17).  Surgical intervention was undergone in 65% (n=17) of our patients in which the median time between imaging findings and time of surgery was 2 (0-59) days. When comparing both modality for reliability in detecting intestinal ischemia and/or perforation with surgical findings, US had a sensitivity of 72% with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 93% while plain radiographs had a sensitivity of 42% with a PPV of 100%.  In all cases that required surgical drainage (n=4), ultrasound findings of complex fluid collections guided the decision for bedside surgical drainage where plain radiograph did not suggest free fluid.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In this study, ultrasound proved to be helpful in assessing the need for surgical interventions in neonates where diagnosis of advanced NEC is ambiguous. US appeared to be more sensitive in reliably detecting intestinal perforation/ischemia in comparison to plain radiographs.  However, both plain radiographs and ultrasound play a key role in the diagnosis and should be considered conjunctively during the management and treatment of NEC.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Management of HO is limited by efficacy of available treatments, difficulty identifying at-risk patients, and high recurrence rates following surgical excision. The cellular and molecular basis of HO is unknown. Here we investigate whether the cells themselves or their environment drive HO formation. We demonstrate that human and mouse cells isolated from sites of HO retain increased osteogenic capacity when cultured outside of an inflammatory environment.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Human cells were cultured from HO and surrounding normal bone. Mouse cells were obtained from two models including trauma-induced and genetic HO. Cells from the trauma induced model were isolated from the tendon transection site of mice which had undergone a dorsal burn with tendon transection (burn/tenotomy) at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after injury, a model that reliably produces HO. In the genetic HO model (Nfatc1-cre/caACVR1<sup>fl/wt</sup>) normal and HO-derived osteoblasts were isolated from 1, 2, and 3 week old mice. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed for by alkaline phosphatase production, alizarin red stain for mineral deposition, RNA expression, and protein expression. Cell proliferation was also assessed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Human HO cells showed increased osteogenic signaling compared to human osteoblasts from non-HO bone (Fig. 1). Cells isolated from the burn/tenotomy mice 2 and 3 weeks after injury demonstrated significantly increased cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, alizarin red stain, and pSmad 1/5 expression when compared with controls. Similarly, HO-derived cells from our genetic HO model in 2 or 3 week old mice exhibited increased cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, alizarin red stain, and pSmad 1/5 expression when compared with non-HO osteoblasts from the same mice (Fig. 2). Finally, targeting these cells with inhibitors of smad5 phosphorylation (LDN-193189) decreased osteogenic capacity by alkaline phosphatase and alizarin red quantification (p&lt;0.05), consistent with its effect on HO formation in our trauma model.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In vitro analysis demonstrates significant differences in cellular behavior with regard to proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in HO models when cells are cultured separate from their in vivo environment. This data suggest that changes in cell behavior drive the process of HO as cell characteristics are preserved after they are removed from their environment. Furthermore, the striking differences in these HO-derived cells from normal cells suggests that they may be used for in vitro assays to study potential therapies targeting HO development.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Trauma/Critical Care"

While radiation therapy and tumor burden are positive predictors for arm lymphedema in breast cancer, this has not been as well defined in the melanoma population using large cohorts. The purpose of this study is to identify unique post-operative and surgical risk factors for SLE in patients with regionally metastatic melanoma using the largest cohort to date compiled from a prospectively collected database of melanoma patients following an ALND or ILND. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: From a prospectively collected, IRB-approved database we identified 688 melanoma patients receiving a complete lymphadenectomy (June 2005-June 2015) with 557 patients having either an ALND or ILND.

On univariate logistic regression [Table], having an ILND (OR=4.58; CI: 2.95-7.11), post-operative adjuvant (OR=1.61 CI: 1.07-2.42) or radiation therapy (OR=1.81 CI: 1.02-3.22), and developing non-SLE complications (e.g. hematoma, infection, DVT) (OR=1.84 CI: 1.21-2.80), were each significantly associated with an increased risk of developing SLE. Non-SLE post-op complications increased the risk of SLE only in the first 2 months after surgery (OR=2.25 CI: 1.35-3.74). Use of an energy device during surgery, number of nodes removed, blood loss, and operative times were not significantly associated with risk of SLE. The average post-op time to develop SLE was 103 &plusmn; 126 days and follow-up was 1.9 &plusmn; 2.2 years.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the largest study to date evaluating surgical/post-op risk factors for SLE in melanoma patients after ALND or ILND.

However, there is often minimal variation in the burden of comorbid disease among patients with AAAs. Analytic morphomics is a novel method of risk-stratification that uses cross-sectional images to quantitatively measure domains of patient health. The utility of morphometric measurements as predictors of surgical outcome has been validated in several patient populations. Previously, AAA mortality after open repair has been associated with total psoas area. This study sought to further understand the role of both core muscle size and adiposity on the risk of mortality following open and endovascular AAA repair.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A total of 795 patients underwent open or endovascular AAA repair between 2000 and 2012. 722 patients (91%) had preoperative abdominal CT scans available for analysis. After excluding patients with incomplete medical records, manual chart review was used to identify patient demographics and comorbidities. Validated methods of analytic morphomics, previously described, were used to measure cross-sectional areas and densities of psoas muscle, dorsal (paraspinous) muscle groups and subcutaneous and visceral fat at the vertebral levels T12 through L5. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine which morphometric variables were significant predictors of mortality, controlling for traditional patient factors. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 610 patients were identified; 322 patients underwent open repairs and 288 underwent endovascular repairs between the years 2000 and 2012. Following open repair, overall mortality ranged from 7% at 90 days to 21.1% at 3 years. Following endovascular repair, overall mortality ranged from 4% at 90 days to 21.3% at 3 years. Morphometric variables associated with mortality between 90 and 1095 days included measures of subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and both dorsal muscle group and psoas muscle density and area. After controlling for patient comorbidities and type of repair, a composite score of morphometric variables continued to be highly associated with mortality between 90 days and 1095 days; important variables included subcutaneous fat density at L2 (OR 1.09, p&lt;0.001) and visceral fat density at L3 (OR 1.08, p&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Morphometric measurements of adiposity and muscle mass correlate strongly with intermediate and late-term mortality after both open and endovascular AAA repair. Traditional methods of risk stratification in patients undergoing AAA repair may be augmented using analytic morphomics. These objective measures of frailty may aid in patient decision-making and provide insight into domains of health that clinicians and patients can work to optimize preoperatively in order to maximize positive outcomes for the patient.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

This study sought to examine lymphovascular invasion as an independent prognostic factor for patients with PTC undergoing total thyroidectomy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Cancer Data Base (2010-2011) was queried for all patients with a diagnosis of PTC undergoing total thyroidectomy. Patients were classified into two groups based on the presence/absence of lymphovascular invasion. Demographic, clinical, and pathologic features at the time of diagnosis were evaluated for all patients. A Cox proportional hazards model was developed to identify factors associated with survival.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In total, 40,324 patients met inclusion criteria; 12.5% had lymphovascular invasion. Patients with lymphovascular invasion were more likely to have larger tumors (2.8 cm vs 1.6 cm, p&lt;0.01), metastatic lymph nodes (75.1% vs 34.1%, p&lt;0.01), and distant metastases (3.1% vs 0.5%, p&lt;0.01). They also were more likely to receive radioactive iodine when compared to patients without lymphovascular invasion (70.2% vs 48.7%, p&lt;0.01). Unadjusted overall survival was reduced for patients with lymphovascular invasion compared to patients without it (log-rank p&lt;0.01), with 5-year survival rates of 86.1% and 94.2%, respectively. After adjustment, increasing patient age (HR=1.06, p&lt;0.01), male gender (HR=1.63, p&lt;0.01), presence of metastatic lymph nodes (HR=1.73, p&lt;0.01), presence of distant metastases (HR=4.90, p&lt;0.01), and presence of lymphovascular invasion (HR=1.99, p&lt;0.01) all were associated with compromised survival.

Rab27a is a GTPase that has been shown to promote exosome secretion. However, mechanisms controlling cell exosome secretion in response to pathologic conditions are not well-defined. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor regulating immunity, carcinogenesis, and hepatic I/R injury. The role of IRF-1 in regulating Rab27a and exosome secretion is unknown. Since IRF-1 can regulate expression of some GTPases, we hypothesized that IRF-1 might regulate Rab27a expression and increase exosome secretion.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Primary human hepatocytes (hHC) and human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 were treated with Interferon-&gamma; (IFN&gamma;).  PCR and Western blot were used to detect IRF-1 and Rab27a mRNA and proteins. Exosomes secreted by hHC and Huh-7 cells were isolated with ultracentrifugation. Isolated exosomes were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and surface markers.  Exosome proteins secreted by these cells were quantitated with bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA). The sizes of the exosomes were measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The binding sites of IRF-1 in promoter region of Rab27a were predicted with PROMO bioinformatics software. IRF-1 expression plasmid and Rab27a promoter-driven luciferase reporter were used to determine the effect of IRF-1 on Rab27a transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were used to verify IRF-l binding in the Rab27a gene promoter region in vivo and in vitro.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: IFN&gamma; increased IRF-1 and Rab27a mRNA and protein in primary hHC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. A). Deflated soccer-ball like exosomes, which were verified by TEM (Fig. B), were secreted more by hHC and Huh7 after IFN&gamma; treatment (Fig. C, p &lt; 0.05).  IFN&gamma; did not alter the exosome size (data not shown). Multi-vesicle bodies (MVB) are precursors of exosomes and were markedly increased by IFN&gamma; stimulation in Huh7 cells (Fig. D, CD63 staining red).  Transfection of HepG2 cells with IRF-1 expression plasmid increased Rab27a promoter activity 4.9-fold. Using PROMO software, we found ten putative IRF-1 binding motifs upstream in the Rab27a promoter region. ChIP and EMSA verified five IRF-1 binding sites in the Rab27a promoter region (data not shown).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These novel findings indicate that IFN&gamma; induces IRF-1 which promotes exosome secretion through increasing the expression of Rab27a. These results provide important insights into fundamental cellular signaling pathways regulating exosome secretion under inflammatory conditions in hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

After excluding centers performing fewer than 10 procedures during the study period, between 66 and 166 centers were included in each procedure analysis. Hospitals in the lowest quartiles of both mortality rate and cost were characterized as high-performing (n=45), and hospitals in the highest quartiles of cost and mortality as low-performing (n=45) (Figure 1). High-performing hospitals for one procedure were never low-performing for another procedure.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: On average, high-performing hospitals had lower proportions of Medicaid patient days (17.5% vs 29.7%; p&lt;0.01), higher proportions of outpatient surgery (62.9% vs 53.3%), and spent more on capital expenditures per bed ($155,710 vs $62,434; p&lt;0.05).

Despite great efforts, we have been unable to effectively target KRAS and it is felt that Ras proteins are 'undruggable'. We now propose a novel approach to overcome this resistance by targeting MEK and CDK 4/6, two key downstream effectors of KRAS.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Expression of Retinoblastoma (Rb) and ERK protein levels in KRAS wild-type and mutant human PDAC cell lines was determined at baseline and with MEK (MEK162) and/or CDK4 (LEE011) inhibition. The effects of combined therapy on cell-cycle progression, colony formation, and invasion were determined. Ptf1a<sup>cre/+</sup>;LSL-Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>;Tgfbr2<sup>flox/flox</sup> (PKT) mice were treated with CDK4/6 and MEK inhibition and transcriptomic profiles were obtained by performing RNAseq on PKT mouse tumors after 2 weeks of treatment with vehicle, LEE011, MEK162, or the combination in addition to wild type Ptf1a<sup>cre/+</sup>;LSL-Kras<sup>WT/WT</sup>;Tgfbr2<sup>flox/flox</sup>. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using baySeq, DESeq2, and EdgeR in a pairwise fashion, and the lists of genes were inputted into WebGestalt (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/) for pathway enrichment analysis using gene ontology (GO), KEGG, and Wikipathways. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to predict therapeutic targets and assess therapeutic response.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 effectively inhibits phosphorylation of Rb in PDAC cell lines.  Combined inhibition of CDK4/6 and MEK decreases pRB and pMAPK expression, delays cell cycle progression, decreases colony formation, and decreases invasion in the KRAS mutant cell lines. GSEA of wild type mouse pancreata vs. control mouse tumor revealed significant upregulation in the MYC targeted pathway, a key regulator of Ras mediated therapeutic resistance. Overall survival (OS) in PKT mice treated with MEK162 or LEE011 alone was not significantly different compared to controls, but mice receiving combined CDK4/6 and MEK inhibition exhibited a 400% increase in OS (59 vs. 251.5 days). Combined CDK4/6 and MEK inhibition significantly downregulated IL-6/STAT3, Kras, EMT, and IL-2/STAT5 related pathways compared with control mice. Combination treated mice also had significant downregulation in IL-6/STAT3 signaling compared to MEK treated mice.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:Targeting KRAS in PDAC through downstream inhibition of MEK remains ineffective due to upregulation of STAT3 signaling. Targeting two key downstream effectors of KRAS signaling with combined inhibition of CDK4/6 and MEK overcomes STAT3 mediated chemoresistance and results in significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy in the aggressive PKT genetic mouse model of PDAC.","Basic Science","Cancer Genetics","Oncology"

Smart phone based thermal imaging utilizing forward looking infrared imaging (FLIR) can easily determine temperature of the extremity. This study reports on the feasibility of using smart phone based FLIR to assess peripheral perfusion by measurement of extremity temperature.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients seen in a vascular clinic with ABI's measured by an ICAVL certified vascular lab were selected. Patients then underwent imaging using a smart phone based FLIR. Color spectrograph was taken and surface temperature of each extremity was determined and recorded. A single operator who was blinded to ABI's results obtained all images. Comparison between ABI and extremity's temperature was performed. Thermal ankle brachial index (TABI) was calculated by dividing the temperature of the lower extremity by that of the upper extremity. Temperature accuracy of FLIR was determined against known standard. Statistical analysis was done using Pearson's correlation and Bland-Altman plot.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 23 patients had both ABI and extremity temperature recorded on the same day resulting in 45 lower extremities analyzed (one patient has a BKA). ABI ranged from 0.33 to 1.46 with mean (IQR) of 0.92 (0.35). Lower extremity temperature ranged from 60.67 to 96.87&deg;F with mean of 83.41 (14.10).  Upper extremity range was 81.86 to 94.60&deg;F with mean of 91.03 (3.44).

Using ABI and the newly described TABI, positive correlation was also seen with r = 0.83, p &lt; .0001, n = 45 (Fig 1).  Thermal sensitivity of FLIR was determined at 0.18&deg;F. When comparing against known standard, thermal imaging has an average of 3.16% error across temperature range of 34 to 144&deg;F.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Smart phone based FLIR imaging can be used to reliably determine extremity perfusion as an alternative to traditional ABI measurement.

Caldwell<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Cincinnati,Division Of Research,Cincinnati, OH, USA <sup>2</sup>University Hospital Essen,Department Of Molecular Biology,Essen, NORTH RHINE - WESTPHALIA, Germany","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Burn-injured patients are susceptible to severe pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Here, we investigate a potential role of the ceramide/sphingosine axis in increased susceptibility. Ceramide levels are regulated by acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) activity that converts the membrane phospholipid sphingomyelin to ceramide. Subsequently, ceramide is hydrolyzed via acid ceramidase to the long chain base, sphingosine. Beyond its cellular localization, sphingosine can be observed extracellularly in microparticles (MPs). Although it is known that sphingosine treatment can be used to combat infection, the role of cellular sphingosine or sphingosine-containing MPs in the defense against pulmonary infection in burn patients has not been elucidated. Altogether, we hypothesize that 1) injury alters Asm activity and subsequently sphingosine levels such that susceptibility to infection is increased and 2) sphingosine treatment will prevent lung PA infection in burn injured mice.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Outbred mice were subjected to a dorsal 28% total body surface area, full thickness scald injury. First, we characterized sphingosine expression in the lungs (by immunohistochemistry) and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) derived MPs (by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis) on post burn day one (PBD1). Second, Asm activity and MP numbers were determined in BAL fluid in mice 24 hours following inoculation with PA. Finally, to determine the effects of sphingosine on infection, some PBD1 mice were pre-treated with sphingosine. All mice were then inoculated with PA and four hours later, colony forming units (CFUs) were enumerated.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Similar to what is seen clinically, infected burn-injured mice had increased mortality as compared to infected uninjured mice (50.0% vs 18.2%, p=0.048). To determine underlying mechanisms of this mortality, we first observed on PBD1, there is a four-fold reduction in bronchial epithelial sphingosine expression in burn injured mice compared to sham. Further, these mice have a significant reduction in total MPs in BAL fluid. Secondly, there was a significant reduction in Asm activity and total MPs in BAL fluid in infected burn mice compared to infected uninjured mice. The BAL MPs from burn infected mice have significantly reduced sphingosine expression. Finally, following PA inoculation, burn mice have a three-log increase in pulmonary infection compared to sham. However, when burn mice are treated with inhaled sphingosine prior to inoculation, there is a significant reduction in pulmonary infection to a level similar to control mice.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The data demonstrate that 1) burn decreases bronchial sphingosine levels and MP numbers, 2) upon infection, injured mice have decreased Asm activity and MP sphingosine levels, and 3) sphingosine treatment prevents lung infection of PA in burn injured mice. These data suggest that in burn patients, treatment with sphingosine will reduce subsequent pulmonary infection.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Trauma/Critical Care"

Burn-induced gut barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation is thought to be one of the sources of bacterial presence in the blood stream. Previously, we have shown that IAP detoxifies bacterial pro-inflammatory factors, prevents endotoxemia, enhances gut barrier functions, and preserves intestinal microbial homeostasis. We have hypothesized that supplemental intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) could be used as a therapeutic modality to prevent gut-derived sepsis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 6-week old CD-1 mice were divided into 4 groups (n=5 in each group). We inflicted a 30% total body surface area burn on the back of mice +/- intradermal Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection mid-eschar of burn site to induce gut barrier dysfunction. IAP or vehicle were administered orally by gastric gavage in a dose of 200U per gavage at 3 and 12 hours post infection. The results were compared to a non-burned control group that underwent a sham procedure. The change in intestinal permeability was assessed by measuring FITC-Dextran 20kD presence in the blood stream at 6 hours post gavage. Bacterial burden in the blood and in intestinal samples was assessed. Intestinal inflammation and cytokine levels were also measured using ELISA.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:TThe experimental group underwent the burn procedure and infection had significantly higher intestinal permeability to FITC-Dextran compared to burn alone or control group mice. (p = 0.01) Oral IAP supplementation significantly reduced the gut barrier dysfunction seen in the treated group. (FITC-Dextran concentration in blood: 0.255 &micro;g/ml in infected group compared to 0.074 &micro;g/ml in IAP treated group, p = 0.04) Consistently, infected mice showed significantly lower serum endotoxin levels in IAP-treated group (2.69 &plusmn; 0.60 EU/ml) compared to infected and no treated group (17.51 &plusmn; 6.14 EU/ml, p = 0.003). IAP treatment reduced the bacterial load in the blood of burn and infected mice (6.3 x 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml of blood in infected group compared to 4.2 x 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/ml in IAP treated infected mice) and in the ileal tissue (1.4 x 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/g of ileal tissue in infection group compared to vs 2.8 x 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/g in IAP group, p = 0.049). Lastly, the burn procedure combined with infection resulted in significant levels of intestinal inflammation, as evidenced by elevated levels of TNF-a in the intestinal tissue. IAP treatment reduced TNF-a level.   <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:IAP is a major regulator of the gut mucosal barrier and is able to ameliorate burn-induced gut barrier dysfunction. It appears that IAP functions through preventing intestinal inflammation. Oral IAP supplementation may represent a novel approach to prevent sepsis in burn patients.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

The role of TLR4 was determined using a model of endotoxemia (LPS 1mg/kg IP 3 h) or experimental NEC in neonatal (7 &ndash; 12 day old) C57Bl/6, TLR4 KO or mice lacking TLR4 in the intestinal epithelium (TLR4<sup>&Delta;IEC</sup>). NEC was induced by feeding formula supplemented with bacteria isolated from human NEC via gavage five times/day and exposure to hypoxia (5%O<sub>2</sub>, 95%N<sub>2</sub>) for 10 min in a hypoxic chamber twice daily for 4 days. TLR4 and serpin B3 deficient enterocytes (IEC-6 cells) were generated using lentivirus-TLR4-shRNA or lentivirus-serpin B3-shRNA, respectively. The role of serpin B3 in the inflammatory response of enterocytes challenged with LPS was evaluated by IL-6, iNOS and IL-1b mRNA expression determined by qRT-PCR.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Human and murine NEC intestinal samples display a significantly increased expression of serpin B3 by mRNA (58 fold and 6 fold, respectively) and evidenced by IHC. These findings were determined to be TLR4-dependent, since serpin B3 expression was significantly lower in TLR4-deficient enterocytes compared to wild-type controls (0.16 vs. 8 fold relative to actin) when challenged with endotoxin. These results are further supported by the fact that endotoxemia leads to upregulation of serpin B3 in wild-type mice (2 fold) but have no effect on TLR4 deficient mice. Moreover, TLR4<sup>&Delta;IEC</sup> mice were protected from developing NEC and had decreased levels of serpin B3. Strikingly, when compared to wild-type IEC-6 cells exposed to LPS, serpin B3-deficient cells were found to have increased expression of the inflammatory mediators iNOS (4 fold), IL-6 (2 fold) and IL-1b (3 fold).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Intracellular serpin B3 levels are significantly increased in the intestine of both human and murine NEC. Normal TLR4 expression in the intestinal epithelium is required for serpin B3 expression. Our findings suggest a potential role for TLR4 regulation of serpin B3, a molecular modulator of intestinal inflammation and necrosis, hallmarks of this devastating disease.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

Volkmer et al. identified bladder tumor initiating cells (BTICs) in progressive stages of differentiation (1). We established patient derived xenografts (PDX) in order to study BTIC biology in vivo. We hypothesized that patient tumors with a greater population of basal or poorly differentiated BTICs would have a poor clinical outcome compared to patients with well-differentiated tumors. Gene expression analysis was performed with the goal of identifying prognostic markers.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients undergoing cystectomy are recruited under an IRB-approved protocol. Tumor samples are received from pathology; fragments are injected subcutaneously into the flank of NOD/SCID mice and monitored for engraftment. Remaining tissue is analyzed with flow cytometry to quantify the BTIC populations. Any tumors which engraft are excised, reimplanted into further generations of mice, and sorted for RNA extraction of the BTIC populations. Subsequent xenograft tumors are treated with either radiation or cisplatin, and analyzed for tumor growth and changes in BTIC populations. Clinical data are gathered using the REDCap web-based data server. RNA expression is assessed using Illumina Human HT-12 array.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of 70 patient samples, 41 tumors have engrafted in mice. There was no correlation between engraftment and survival. However, a correlation between greater basal BTIC populations and overall survival approached significance (p=0.09). If patients did not receive systemic chemotherapy (n=28), the basal BTICs conferred a greater risk to overall survival (LR 5.5, p=0.06) than among patients (n=21) who received any systemic chemotherapy (LR 0.62, p=0.74). The basal BTICs comprise an average of 1% of the tumor cells (range 0-17%). Early results indicate a differential response to cisplatin and radiation among PDX tumors for both agents. Analysis of the RNA array identified a signature of 54 genes suppressed in basal BTICs relative to the more differentiated tumor cells. This gene signature correlates with overall survival (p=0.0047) and disease-specific survival (p=0.0085) in a large cohort of patients.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our results suggest that the presence of a small percentage of basal BTICs portends a poor clinical outcome, which may be improved by the addition of chemotherapy. RNA evaluation of these BTICs has revealed potential biological markers and targets for future therapy, as well as a gene signature which may provide a tool for improved patient selection for therapy.

However, stiffness is difficult to quantify in vivo, as it requires an invasive pressure measurement, so surrogate markers (e.g., pulse wave velocity) aid in assessing temporal changes in stiffness. We developed a novel method to quantify vascular stiffness in vivo and applied it on mouse model of atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that disturbed flow (i.e., low and oscillatory wall shear stress) leads to progressive arterial stiffening. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A partial carotid artery ligation was performed on the left side of C57Bl/6 (wild-type, WT; n = 9) to induce a disturbed hemodynamic environment. Serial ultrasound imaging data of the ligated and non-ligated (control) carotid arteries were acquired at days (d) 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 post-ligation in each animal. Arterial cyclic deformation was extract from the imaging data with a custom image-processing algorithm, and the maximum circumferential (Green's) strain, which is a surrogate marker for vascular stiffness, was calculated across a cardiac cycle. Recognize that stiffness and strain exhibited an inverse relationship. ?? <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: ???As early as 7 days post-ligation, we observed a significant difference in circumferential strain between the non-ligated (0.35&plusmn; 0.10) and ligated (0.25 &plusmn; 0.08) arteries (p = 0.01; i.e., the ligated arteries became more stiff). The ligated arteries exhibited a continued decrease in circumferential strain throughout serial image acquisition, while the non-ligated arteries remain unchanged. At day 28, the non-ligated arteries had greater than two times the circumferential strain of the ligated (0.35 &plusmn; 0.09 vs. 0.15 &plusmn; 0.07; p = 0.003). Overall, there was a 36% decrease in circumferential strain observed from day 3 to day 28 in the ligated compared to 25% increase in the non-ligated. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: ??In conclusion, our data indicates a strong relationship between disturbed hemodynamics and arterial stiffness. We observed that arteries exposed to surgically-induced disturbed hemodynamics become stiffer over time, while control arteries did not. Furthermore, we observed continued stiffening over time in the ligated arteries. Our model of partial carotid ligation will serve as a validated method for investigating causes, treatments, and prevention of arterial stiffness.","Basic Science","Endothelial/Vascular Physiology","Vascular"

Vyas<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Michigan State University,College Of Human Medicine,Lansing, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Inflammation is well known to be a key culprit behind tumor promotion in Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Pro-inflammatory secretion of interleukins and chemotaxic agents results in increased cell motility, invasiveness, and ultimately enhanced survival and metastasis. Several chemotherapeutic drugs currently used for treatment are effective in targeting proliferated malignant cells and attenuating disease prognosis&mdash;however, not without significant shortcomings. Doxorubicin, the current first-line therapy for MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer has its benefits but at the same time, causes serious drug-induced inflammation that often leads to further tumor cell proliferation and metastasis.  In hopes of further understanding TNBC pro-inflammatory drug effects, we have studied a novel class of drugs known as second-generation proteasome inhibitors that demonstrate a reduction in inflammation. In this study, we focused on conducting a gene array to elucidate the effects of carfilzomib and doxorubicin on pro-inflammatory gene expression in both MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231 cells.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: MCF-10A normal breast cells and MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells were treated or left untreated with vehicle control (0.1% DMSO), Carfilzomib (5 nM), Doxorubicin (30 nM), or a combination of both in complete growth medium for 24hr. The concentrations of Carfilzomib and Doxorubicin used were in accordance with previous studies conducted in the lab. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit and The Taqman Human Inflammation Array was used for gene expression.  A comparison of the amount of inflammatory gene expression was made via quantitative PCR. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:93 Inflammatory Gene Microarray design. The actions of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, transcription factors, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes are well recognized in both malignant and non-malignant states. Control cDNAs of the housekeeping gene such as 18S were used for signal normalization and quantitation. Genes that were up-regulated by more than 1.5 fold or down-regulated by at least 1.5 fold were considered significant and a comparison of fold-change in expression of these controls, MCF-10A versus MDA-MB-231, was made. The design resulted in 6 main genes being identified as significant inflammatory modulators: HPGD, KLKB1, TNFSF13B, VCAM1, IL1RAPL2, and PTAFR.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Both carfilzomib and doxorubicin are seen to suppress several up regulated pro-inflammatory genes in MDA-MB-231 cells. Most notably, KLKB1, IL1RAPL2 and VCAM1 pro-inflammatory genes demonstrated drug-induced effects, resulting in inflammatory suppression. On the other hand, HPGD, TNFSF13B, and PTAFR genes showed pro-inflammation upon giving the specific drug regimen. This suggests that these genes, along with the others identified through microarray, are significantly  involved in inflammatory pathways. Further studies are needed to assess how their down-regulation may serve to supplement TNBC therapy.","Basic Science","Cancer Genetics","Oncology"

In ccRCC patients, cachexia is correlated with decreased survival, while obesity is associated with increased survival. Cachexia results in part from host response to tumor-produced cytokines. Here we assessed the associations between body composition, tumor cytokine expression and overall survival (OS) in ccRCC. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Cancer Imaging Archive and the Cancer Genome Atlas were queried for ccRCC patients with available abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging studies, survival information and tumor RNAseq data. All three datasets were available for 215 patients.  SKM, intramuscular AT tissue (IMAT), visceral AT (VAT), and subcutaneous AT (SAT) area were measured at the L3 vertebral level in CT scans using Sliceomatic. Data were stratified by gender and tissue area quartiles. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log rank test (p&lt;0.05) were used for OS comparisons between highest and lowest quartiles for each tissue area. Associations between tumor expression of 21 cachexia-associated cytokines and SKM were analyzed with Spearman's rank correlation (rho&gt;0.1, p&lt;0.05) with False Discovery Rate for multiple comparisons. Identified genes were probed for OS differences between groups stratified below and above median gene expression. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:OS was lower in the lowest versus the highest quartile for SKM in both males and females (p=0.002 and p=0.010, respectively).

No differences in OS for IMAT were noted in either sex. Correlation coefficients for gene expression and any tissue measurement were small (&lt;0.2). For SKM, the tissue presumably most functionally important for survival, correlated genes were INHBB, CTF1, and TGFB2 (p=0.029, p=0.010 and 0.028). Gene expression of 7 other cytokines were robustly associated with reduced OS (Table). <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:Body composition analysis showed sex-specific differences in body composition. Low SKM area was robustly associated with decreased OS in both males and females independent of stage in ccRCC, consistent with abundant data linking muscle loss and mortality. Differences in the other associations of body composition and OS indicated a possible gender-specific role of AT in ccRCCC. Tumor-derived mediators of cachexia are highly associated with survival in ccRCC, although not with body composition, suggesting they might act indirectly.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

S1P is known to play important roles in cancer cell survival and progression. We previously demonstrated that S1P is a crucial mediator of breast cancer-induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and promote metastasis. On the other hand, ceramide has been considered to mediate anti-proliferative responses, such as cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, senescence modulation and autophagy. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that de novo-generated ceramides may have distinct functions based on their fatty acid chain lengths, subcellular localization and/or direct downstream targets. Although important roles of sphingolipids in breast cancer progression has been revealed in experimental models, its roles in human patients are yet to be determined. In this study, we measure the levels of sphingolipids including S1P and ceramides in tumor and normal breast tissue by state-of-the-art mass spectrometry.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Tumor and normal tissue were obtained from 11 patients with breast cancer.

The levels of S1P and dihydro-S1P in tumor tissue were significantly higher than those in normal breast tissue with almost two-fold increase. Further, C16:0, C22:0, C24:1 and C24:0 ceramides in tumor tissue were also significantly higher than those in normal tissue.

Guo<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>State University Of New York At Buffalo,Surgery,Buffalo, NY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Interest and applications to surgery have steadily decreased over years in the US.  The goal of this review is to collect literatures regarding US medical students' attitude regarding their experience and factors influencing their intentions to pursue surgery as a career. We hypothesize that factors influencing US medical students' career choice in surgery are multi-factorial.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Six electronic databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ERIC, Embase and PsycINFO) were searched. The inclusion criteria were studies published after 2000 related to factors influencing surgical career choice among US medical students.  We identified 33 relevant articles out of more than 1,000 non-duplicated titles.  A quality index score was given to each article to minimize risk of bias. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:More than half of medical students made the decision for a surgical career prior to entering medical schools.  Good mentorship was a positive influence on students' decision, and students who participated more in the operating room were more likely to pursue surgery. Bias and stereotypes had a large impact on students' perception of general surgery, and influenced their decision. Lifestyle was an important deterrent in pursuing a surgical career. The increase in the importance of lifestyle is generational rather than gender-based.  Numbers of articles on each factor are shown in Table 1.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This comprehensive systemic review identifies a comprehensive number of factors involved in US medical students' decision to choose a surgical career.  Among them, mentorship, bias and stereotypes, clerkship experience and lifestyle are the major factors.  These represent areas that can be improved to attract applicants to general surgery residencies. Since this is an early decision even before entering medical school, early introduction to the field of surgery, recruitment strategies during the preclinical and clinical years of medical school can increase their interest in a future surgical career.  Surgical residents and faculty can have a positive influence on medical students' decision to pursue surgery as a career.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Despite this, few courses in global surgery for medical students exist and none offers a combined approach of didactics and field experience. Trends within global health education demonstrate the importance of didactic and practical components in immersive learning. We have endeavored, therefore, to create a comprehensive course in global surgery offered to medical students. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a search of the peer-reviewed and grey literature on surgical education. The search revealed a number of international rotations for residents as well as several medical schools offering global health rotations. We found only three with didactic curricula for students interested in global surgery. We reached out to each of these organizations and were able to obtain their full curricula. We reviewed these courses as well as the peer-reviewed literature on global surgery in order to design a curriculum.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We developed a course with a format unlike those of other global surgery courses for students. The students will spend two weeks in Sweden in didactic lectures, small groups, and simulation training followed by two weeks of clerkship activities at a teaching hospital in Zimbabwe. They will return to Sweden for a final week of wrap-up, testing, and presentations. The course will be evaluated using adaptations of previously validated pre/post-course surveys of the student's knowledge and attitudes toward global health and surgery's place in the field.The major themes covered in the course will be global health, surgery as an integral component of global health, clinical skills and knowledge relevant to low resource settings, international partnerships and cultural competency. A key to this course was finding the right international parnter. The swedish university established a partnership with a university in Zimbabwe. Through this partnership students in this course will rotate on the various surgical services at the teaching hospital where they will be accompanied by instructors. Nightly meetings will be held to share experiences from the day. Planned future course iterations will include further collaboration with students from Zimbabwe coming to Sweden.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Despite an enormity of interest, few medical schools offer organized curricula in global surgery. None offer a combination of a didactics in global surgery and a field experience in a low resource setting.  This course, which represents a partnership between universities in the U.S., Sweden and Zimbabwe will be the first of its kind. Students and faculty at the three institutions welcomed the unique nature of the curriculum. Students filled the registration spots for the course and will begin in October 2015.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Increasingly, attention is being paid to the concept of achieving 'balance' in life in an effort to preserve social and psychological fitness during the stressful years of residency.  We have created a committee to address Balance in Life in our department and in this study attempt to assess the level of balance experienced by our general surgical residents over time and to identify particular causes of stress during their training.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: General surgical residents in an academic medical center were surveyed during their clinical and professional-development years at separate time points over a three-year period (2013-2015).  Two paper-and-pencil questionnaires were used: The Life Balance survey consists of 15 true/false questions, the Causes of Stress survey requires ratings of 10 potential stressors.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:General surgical residents from all post-graduate levels, including professional development years, participated in the study in 2013, 2014, and 2015.  We found that residents felt significantly more 'out of balance' as they progressed in training year, with more PGY1s reporting being 'in balance' than their more senior colleagues.  Further, there was improvement in overall 'balance' over time.  In terms of causes of stress, we noted that personal stressors were more frequently cited than professional stressors across all years. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Balance in life appears to be more difficult to achieve for general surgical residents as they advance in training.  However, we have been able to show improvement in overall balance in our academic program over a three-year period, perhaps due to the dedication of departmental resources to this specific issue.  We also were able to identify important causes of stress for all residents, with personal (eg, health problems, break-ups, finances) being cited more frequently than professional (difficult colleagues or faculty) issues.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Since the opening of a delivery center within our free-standing children's hospital in 2011 the majority of patients treated for GS at our center are inborn.  We hypothesized that inborn patients had improved outcomes compared to patients born at an outside hospital (outborn) and transferred to our center for definitive treatment. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A single center retrospective chart review at a pediatric tertiary care center was performed from 2011 to 2014.  All patients whose primary surgical treatment of GS was performed at this center were included.  Findings are reported in mean &plusmn; standard deviations.  Comparative analysis was performed using student t test for continuous variables and Fishers exact for binary variables. Significance was defined as a P &le; 0.05.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  During the study period 79 patients with GS were identified.  Of these, 53 were inborn and 26 were outborn.  The rat e of complicated GS was higher in the outborn group (32%) compared to the inborn population (11%) (p=0.03).  Given the expected wide variability in outcomes for patients with complicated GS, outcomes for uncomplicated GS were analyzed.  Table 1 shows perioperative outcomes comparing inborn and outborn patients with uncomplicated GS. Length of stay, readmission rate and TPN were all significantly decreased for inborn patients, while time to definitive closure was similar.    Mortality was 0% for both inborn and outborn patients. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Benefit is derived for patients with GS who are inborn rather than outborn.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

In Rwanda, peritonitis is linked with major complications and mortality, though little is known regarding risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with mortality among patients with peritonitis and propose strategies to improve management of peritonitis at a referral hospital in Rwanda. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All patients operated for peritonitis at a referral hospital in Rwanda over a six-month period were analyzed. Charts were prospectively reviewed for demographic, clinical and administrative data. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with in-hospital mortality and return to the operating room. Factors included in the analyses included sociodemographic factors, clinical presentation, laboratory studies, diagnoses and operative findings. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Over a six-month period, 281 patients underwent operation for peritonitis. The in-hospital post-operative mortality rate was 17%. 36 (13%) patients required a return to the operating room. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with mortality included: high American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (ASA&gt;3) (Odds Ratio (OR) 7.4, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.2, 44.6) and vasopressor requirements (OR 20.6, 95% CI: 2.3, 185.7). Hypoxia on admission was associated with a return to the operating room (OR 9.4, 95%CI: 1.7, 52.7). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Peritonitis causes significant morbidity and mortality in Rwanda. By identifying factors associated with complications and mortality, mechanisms to improve the quality of care and improve resource utilization can be achieved. As mortality is correlated with high ASA score and vasopressor use, greater availability of critical care services and intensive care access could potentially improve outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

Our medical center is not only the official hospital for a professional baseball team, but our center is located a half mile from the stadium. Anecdotal evidence suggests there is a link between trauma and home games; however, there is a paucity of data regarding the variability of operative hand and facial trauma. This study aims to characterize the hand and facial trauma requiring reconstructive surgical intervention at a Level 1 trauma center over a 14 year period, focusing on the effect of a professional baseball team.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of all reconstructive surgical cases for traumatic hand or facial injuries at a Level 1 center between 1/1/1999 and 12/31/2012 was performed. The dates of injury, admission status, and operative repair were collected as well as demographic information including: gender, age, state of residence, and insurance status. Patients were categorized into groups based on whether their trauma occurred on the date of a home game. Descriptive analysis of the variability in injury volume was performed for all cases.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, the highest incidence of hand and facial trauma requiring subsequent operative plastic surgical intervention was in the month of October, followed by July and August. Hand trauma peaked in July, while facial trauma peaked in October with a relative nadir in the summer months. The most injuries overall occurred on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, though hand trauma was most commonly seen on Friday and facial trauma on Monday. Overall, operative trauma requiring reconstructive interventions occurred at a rate of 33.4 injuries per 100 days when home games were played, compared to 22.2 injuries per 100 days when the team did not have a home game. Similar trends were noted when subgroup analysis was performed individually for hand or facial trauma. Additionally, when the groups were compared, patients were more likely to present as a result of motorcycle accidents (3.1% v. 1.5%; p =0.04) or bicycle accidents (5.0% v. 2.6%; p =0.01) when home games were played. Other mechanisms of trauma, age, gender, insurance status, need for admission and length of stay were not statistically different between the groups.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Overall volume of operative hand and facial trauma is similar to previous findings with relative peaks during late summer months and on weekends. Subgroup analysis reveals considerable variability in the monthly and weekly patterns of traumatic hand and facial injuries. Importantly, although there were few differences between the groups, there was an increased rate of injuries associated with dates when there our local professional baseball team had home games. Further analysis of these trends may allow improved specialty resource allocation and strategies for injury prevention and treatment.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Plastics"

We sought to evaluate contemporary trends in hand preference, perceived dexterity, and impact of handedness on training amongst medical students.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An anonymous survey was distributed to third and fourth year medical students at the end of the academic year (when they were likely to have completed at least one surgical clerkship). Hand preference was queried for various activities (i.e. throwing an object, cutting with scissors, holding a needle driver, using a scalpel). A Likert scale was utilized to assess perceived dexterity and impact of handedness on surgical training. We also evaluated whether handedness and perceived dexterity were associated with a decision to pursue a surgical specialty. Fisher's exact test was utilized to compare the proportion of students reporting a positive response (e.g. agree/strongly-agree), contrasting students who reported writing with left and right hand. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the medical students queried, 131 (37%) responded.  The majority (80%) reported writing with their right hand (19% left hand; 1% both).  Results are summarized in Table 1.  Left-hand writers frequently prefer their right hand for other activities: 42% holding a needle driver, 29% cutting with scissors, 21% using a scalpel.  A greater percent of left-handed students felt that their performance would improve if trainers better adapted to their handedness (70% vs. 14%, p&lt;0.001), that they would benefit from additional training with right-handed instruments (61% vs. 31%, p&lt;0.01), and that they would benefit if left-handed instruments were made available (63% vs. 8%, p&lt;0.001). Perceived dexterity was significantly associated with  plans to pursue a surgical specialty (p&lt;0.0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Medical students who write with their left hand reported being more ambidextrous than those who write with their right hand.  They also perceive that their handedness may impact their training and decision to pursue a surgical specialty.  Left-handed medical students were also more likely to report that they would benefit from left-handed instrumentation and training that adapts to their handedness.  These results provide a contemporary snapshot of hand preference in medical students and a compelling argument for improving and adapting surgical training for left-handed individuals.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

It is unclear whether this persists in practicing surgeons or affects performance, but anecdotal evidence suggests that this is likely. The purpose of this study is to gather opinions from practicing surgeons about the role of professional confidence in order to develop a survey instrument about surgeon confidence.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fourteen practicing surgeons from a variety of practice environments (private, academic), specialties (general surgery, urology, obstetrics and orthopedics) and geographic locations. Answers to open-ended questions about surgeon confidence were transcribed, coded and analyzed by two independent researchers. An iterative process was utilized to identify well-defined themes. Saturation was achieved.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:More than half the interviewees were male (64%), and the average age was 47 years (range 35-74 years). Time since entering practice ranged from 1-42 years (mean 15.1 years). All respondents felt that confidence was important for surgeons, and the main reasons given were the need to make important decisions quickly with limited information, and to perform complex procedures based on those decisions. Decision-making was felt to be difficult without confidence in one's skills, knowledge and judgement. Additionally, one-third observed that confidence was necessary to tolerate poor outcomes and the inherent uncertainties associated with surgical practice. Most surgeons (86%) agreed that, in general, a confident surgeon was a better surgeon, although many respondents (71%) stressed the dangers of overconfidence.  Confidence was felt to facilitate better decision-making (36%) and arise from experience and good outcomes. Surgeons viewed low confidence as arising from less preparation, knowledge, or skill (43%). A surgeon was perceived as confident if he/she was decisive and rarely deviated from plan (29%), articulated thoughts clearly (29%), appeared calm and organized (36%) and appeared to be well-prepared (21%). Several surgeons (43%) acknowledged projecting more confidence in certain clinical situations than was felt, stating that it was important for instilling trust in patients and providing leadership for the medical team. Additionally, projecting confidence was felt to be self-reinforcing.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Confidence is often equated with competence by practicing surgeons, and is felt to be essential to the type of decision making inherent in surgical practice. This underlines the importance of fostering confident behavior in trainees. It also highlights the need to teach techniques that allow both trainees and practicing surgeons to address uncertainty in decision-making and gaps in knowledge and skill without fearing loss of respect from colleagues and patients. A national survey querying surgeons regarding confidence will be developed using these themes.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

However, this technique relies on intact phrenic nerve function and is significantly less effective in patients with a spinal cord injury in the C3-C5 levels. Recently, the use of phrenic nerve reconstruction with intercostal nerves has expanded the indications for diaphragmatic pacing. Our study aimed to evaluate the use and efficacy of intercostal nerve transfer in diaphragmatic pacing.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  5 ventilator dependent patients with high cervical injuries were selected for this study. Each patient demonstrated either unilateral or bilateral phrenic nerve dysfunction via external neck or intra-operative nerve stimulation. Each patient underwent laparoscopic implantation of the diaphragmatic pacer followed by a thoracotomy for an intercostal to phrenic nerve graft. The patients were followed post operatively and ventilator dependence was reassessed for at 1 year post-op.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Initial results of this ongoing study show that 3 out of 5 patients are tolerating ventilator weaning trials. One patient can tolerate spontaneous breathing for 24 hours at a time. 1 patient is only 4 months post op and is still awaiting axonal regeneration, which takes approximately 1 year.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We demonstrate that intercostal nerve reconstruction of the phrenic nerve with diaphragmatic pacing is a safe and promising procedure for ventilator dependent patients with direct phrenic nerve injury, offering unprecedented improvements to functional status. The nerve's proximity to the diaphragm and its length make it amenable for this surgery. With further research, diaphragmatic pacing can be extended to more patients with direct phrenic nerve injuries and/or high cervical spine injuries.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

However, it requires specialized equipment with significant cost that is not commonly available in most clinical settings. The recent emergence of transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) as an additional technique to address these tumors provides the opportunity to embrace the benefits of TEM while using commonly available and less expensive operative equipment. However, as with any new technique, the oncologic principles and outcomes must not be compromised. This review will focus on comparing outcomes between TEM and TAMIS utilizing available studies in the published literature.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A systematic review of the literature (PubMed, EBSCO, Cochrane Library) was conducted to identify studies related to TEM and TAMIS (since its emergence in the literature in 2010). Only one experimental study to date has compared TAMIS and TEM head-to-head from a technical standpoint, although several studies on quality of life between these two techniques do exist. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Margin positivity following resection is low with both techniques (TAMIS approximately 4%). Recurrence of disease is infrequent occurring in 4% of TAMIS cases and approximately 5% of TEM cases for small tumors (up to 3 cm), although the rate of recurrence for TEM does rise with larger tumors. Overall complication rates between TAMIS and TEM are comparable with perioperative morbidity from TAMIS ranging from 7.4%-19% and from TEM ranging from 6%-31%. One experimental comparison study reveals that TEM is quicker and subjectively allows for better appreciation of the surgical dissection and less difficulty with suturing compared to TAMIS. Quality of life after resection and anorectal function are similar between TAMIS and TEM. In addition, TAMIS is now being applied to total mesorectal excision of rectal tumors although early data are limited.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although long-term data for TAMIS are limited, both TAMIS and TEM are valuable techniques for the local excision of Early stage rectal cancer. Given its lower cost and faster learning curve, TAMIS holds significant promise in becoming the favored technique. However, randomized prospective data comparing these two techniques does not exist. As such, a randomized, controlled trial comparing TEM to TAMIS in the management of rectal cancer is timely and essential.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

The goal of this study was to evaluate the variability of operative hand and face trauma over a 14 year period at a Level 1 trauma center.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of all Plastic and Reconstructive surgical cases for traumatic hand or face injuries at a Level 1 center in New England between 1/1/1999 and 12/31/2012 was performed. The dates of injury, admission (if applicable), and operative repair were collected and patients organized based on the date of injury. Demographic information included gender, age at injury, state of residence, and health insurance status. Length of stay and traumatic mechanism were also identified for comparison. Descriptive analysis of the variability in injury volume was performed for all cases as well as for hand trauma and face trauma subgroups.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Overall, the highest incidence of hand and face trauma requiring subsequent Plastic or Reconstructive surgery intervention was in the month of October, followed by July and August.  Hand trauma peaked in July, while face trauma peaked in October with a relative nadir in the summer months (Figure 1). The most injuries overall occurred on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday - though hand trauma was most common on Friday and face trauma on Monday.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Overall volume of operative hand and face trauma is similar to previous findings with relative peaks during late summer months and on weekends. Subgroup analysis reveals considerable variability in the monthly and weekly patterns of traumatic hand and face injuries. Further analysis of these trends may allow improved specialty resource allocation and strategies for injury prevention.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Traditional methods of resection risk exposure of the thoracic cavity to direct peritoneal contamination. We describe a novel technique using a stapling device for full-thickness diaphragmatic resection without entering the pleural cavity.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of all patients undergoing CRS at our institution from December 2012 to June 2014 was performed. Full-thickness diaphragm resection was performed secondary to gross involvement of the diaphragm using sequential fires of the Endoscopic Linear Cutter stapler (Echelon Flex<sup>TM</sup> with cartridges of open staple height of 3.8 to 4.2mm depending on thickness). Breathing was held during individual stapler firings.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of sixty patients were included in the cohort.  Nine patients (15%) underwent diaphragm resection to achieve complete cytoreduction.  Seven patients underwent unilateral diaphragm resection (right-sided).  One patient required suture line reinforcement using #1 PDS because the staple line was thought to be tenuous.  Two patients underwent bilateral diaphragm resection.  Thoracostomy tubes were electively placed intraoperatively in the initial three patients, and were removed prior to discharge. In the subsequent six patients, no thoracostomy tube was placed. All patients were extubated immediately post-operatively or within 24 hours of their operation. There were no postoperative respiratory complications, including pneumonia, thoracic abscess, thoracostomy placement, or respiratory failure requiring reintubation.  To date, there has been no documented thoracic recurrence of disease on cross-sectional imaging in the patients who underwent diaphragm resection.   <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Full-thickness diaphragm resection using the Endoscopic Linear Cutter stapler in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery for peritoneal carcinomatosis involving the diaphragm is a safe, hemostatic, and expeditious technique. More importantly, this technique prevents oncological contamination of the thoracic cavity and reduces the need for pleural drainage.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Oncoplastic surgery combines both BCT and reconstructive techniques. Choosing the best method to repair a defect is essential in optimizing outcomes and minimizing the potential for postoperative complications within this patient population. The aim of this study is to present a treatment algorithm based on diagnosis, tumor size, tumor location, breast size and patient satisfaction. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a retrospective review of all patients undergoing immediate oncoplastic reconstruction (simple closure, tissue rearrangement, pedicle flap, mastopexy, bilateral reduction) between 2010 and 2015. Operative data, pre- and post-operative pathology reports and follow-up appointments from patient records were analyzed. Patient satisfaction was measured using the BREAST-Q questionnaire. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of forty-two women were included in the study. A majority of women had invasive ductal carcinoma (n=21, 45.7%). In most, the tumor was located in the upper outer quadrant (n=25, 54.3%). Twenty-two women (52.4%) had a bra cup size of either A, B, or C and 18 women (42.9%) had cup size of D or larger. The most common approach in women with cups A, B, or C was a simple closure or tissue rearrangement, and, when needed, a pedicle flap. In patients with a D cup or larger and grade II-III breast ptosis, a bilateral reduction technique was performed. These approaches provided the best aesthetic and oncological outcomes with negative resection margins. Patient satisfaction was high within our patient population.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this study the authors present a reconstructive algorithm describing different oncoplastic approaches and aimed at providing a validated guideline for oncoplastic reconstructive surgery.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Plastics"

By placing a silicone splint, contracture of the panniculus carnosus is prevented allowing the wound to heal primarily by granulation and re-epithelialization, resembling the human wound repair process. However, accurate determination of when the wound is fully healed is difficult and may skew results. Herein, we describe a novel methodology to more accurately determine wound healing using a double transgenic mouse.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Double transgenic mice were created by crossing K14-Cre mice with reporter line ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup>, effectively labeling skin with GFP. Circular cutaneous full-thickness excisional wounds 6 mm in diameter were created on the left and right dorsum of mice just caudal to the scapula. Silicone splints were placed and affixed to the skin using cyanoacrylate glue and 8 simple interrupted stitches using 6-0 nylon suture. The wounds were covered with a clear occlusive dressing, which was replaced every other day when gross macroscopic light and fluorescence images were taken.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:By using gross macroscopic light imaging, the average time to full closure was determined to be 13.6 days post-wounding. Using fluorescence imaging, the average time to full closure was 11.6 days (*p&lt;0.05) post-wounding. Histology with fluorescence imaging confirmed wounds were fully healed by 12 days following wound creation.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:These data suggest that wound closure is more accurately determined using the K14-Cre/ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup> double transgenic mouse and fluorescence imaging. Based on our data, this mouse model should be utilized as a quantitative and reproducible model of excisional wound healing.","Basic Science","Wound Healing/Fibrosis","Plastics"

Journal clubs encourage participants to keep abreast of current medical literature and to practice critical analysis and discussion of primary literature; as well, there is increasing emphasis on application of evidence-based medicine and primary literature analysis in the education of medical students. Often, when medical students become residents, they have never taken an active role in a journal club discussion. To our knowledge, there are no journal clubs that are intended for and led by medical students. We sought to implement a Surgery Journal Club that was led by medical students under guidance of attending surgeons, with the goals of giving students opportunities to practice analyzing primary literature, to practice facilitation and participating in journal club discussion, and to educate students on important issues in surgery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We conducted a needs assessment survey of 38 third-year medical students. The journal club met once monthly for five consecutive months based on findings from that survey. Articles were chosen by students with input from an attending surgeon and were distributed at least one week in advance. Each meeting was attended by 3 to 8 students and a different attending surgeon. Discussion was facilitated by both student leaders and the attending surgeon. At the end of the semester, we conducted a feedback survey of both participating students and attending surgeons.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 24/38 (63%) students responded to our needs assessment survey. 33% of these students were interested in surgery as a career; 50% said a surgery journal club would add value to the clinical curriculum. 50% of the respondents had never before participated in a journal club. Feedback from the faculty (4/5 responded) indicated they all 'strongly agreed' that they enjoyed facilitating a journal club, that the journal club was a good use of their time, and that they would facilitate another session in the future. Student feedback was received from 7 students out of 10 (70%) who attended at least one session. They indicated that the two main benefits to journal club participation were 'practicing critical analysis of primary literature' and 'reading and discussing &lsquo;classic' articles in the field'.  Additionally, students noted that a benefit to the journal clubs was networking with faculty and mentorship opportunities. All students agreed that they enjoyed the session(s) they attended, and 6/7 (86%) said the Journal Club should continue.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The initial implementation of a Surgery Journal Club was successful, as gauged by both participating medical students and attending surgeons. The Journal Club met the initial objectives, with the added benefit of mentorship opportunities.

However, residents satisfaction with EMR and professional satisfaction remain high. The nature of remote EMR work, which could be continuation of unfinished patient charting or preparation for conference or operative room planning, has not been well defined.  Furthermore, the impact of increased EMR use on resident education and work hour compliance needs better evaluation.

In order to help understand and more correctly interpret statistics reported in clinical studies, we provide a simple, yet comprehensive, explanation of common research methodology involving receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. ROC curves are most frequently used in medicine as a quantitative method of evaluating diagnostic tests. While this type of statistical analysis is widely used in surgical research and publication, in fact, many of these methods are not fully understood by clinicians or researchers.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In order to demonstrate the interpretation of an ROC curve we utilized results from a plasma-based test developed to diagnose colorectal cancer. Blood samples were taken from 67 patients, 18 patients with colorectal cancer and 49 patients with other types of cancer (breast, lung or pancreas). Using plasma miRNA as biomarkers, a model was developed to predict from which patients the blood sample had come from. ROC curves were generated to determine the accuracy of this plasma test. ROC curves are made by plotting sensitivity (true positive rate) on the y-axis, and 1-specificity (false positive rate) on the x-axis. Each point plotted on the ROC curve represents a sensitivity/specificity pair corresponding to a particular threshold cut off. It is generally accepted that at least 100 pair values are generated to create a curve; note that more pair values provide a better estimate of area under the curve (AUC).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Curves that approach closest to coordinate (x=0, y=1) are more highly predictive, whereas curves that lie close to the line of equality indicate that the result is no better than chance. The optimum sensitivity and specificity can be determined as the point where the minimum distance line crosses the ROC curve (see figure). This point corresponds to the Youden Index, J, a function of sensitivity and specificity commonly used to rate diagnostic tests. The AUC is used to quantify the overall ability of a test to discriminate between two outcomes.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:By following these simple guidelines, interpretation of ROC curves will be less difficult and more useful when writing, reviewing or interpreting scientific papers. Parameters such as test sensitivity and specificity can be obtained from ROC curves and can be helpful in deciding whether a diagnostic test is acceptable for use.","Outcomes/Clinical","Clinical Trials","Cross Disciplinary"

Universities, on the other hand, thrive on discovery and variation as a source of innovation.  As a result, we believe that properly structured academic-industry partnerships in medical technology development will enhance and accelerate innovation. We recently created an industry-university partnership focused on global cervical cancer prevention. Our industry partner provided expertise in medical technology commercialization, the validated clinical problem and mentoring in product-market-fit and regulatory-based product development.  The University provided subject matter experts in human factors design, engineering, clinical care and usability testing.Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death for young women with &gt;250,000 attributed deaths annually; 90% in the developing world. Therapeutic modalities for the management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasms (CIN) are not designed for developing regions; they are expensive, require a skilled workforce, a stable electrical grid or availability of cryogenic liquids.  Our task was to develop a solution that would effectively treat CIN in low-resource settings.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Our Center for Medical Innovation created a trans-disciplinary team of graduate and medical students, surgical residents and clinical faculty. Our industry partner presented the validated need and business mentorship.  Solution development was left entirely to the student team to optimize the innovation process and reduce bias.  The team studied the therapeutic landscape, environmental constraints, and treatment guidelines and used simulation to understand human factors design and usage requirements. Prototyping and verification testing was conducted in our in-house facility. A final design was selected, prototyped, tested.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Based on treatment guidelines and regulatory data our team pursued development of a thermo-coagulation device.

The duration of follow up did not differ between the two groups (4.4 &plusmn; 0.3 vs. 4.4 &plusmn; 0.5 years; p=0.55).  There was a trend towards increased postoperative stroke in patients with SID (10.5% vs. 0%; p = 0.11). In late follow up, the mean postoperative PSV was significantly lower in patients with SID (114.5 &plusmn; 71.3 vs. 183.5 cm/sec; p=0.01).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients with severe carotid stenosis undergoing CEA have a high prevalence of SID, and a trend towards an increased rate of postoperative stroke. A larger sample size will be required to confirm these results.  Careful perioperative control of autoinflammatory disease may enable further reduction of perioperative stroke after CEA.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

It has been demonstrated that the presence of activated Hedgehog pathway (Hh) in epithelial tumor cells of colorectal cancer is essential for tumor growth, recurrence and metastatic growth, and regulates the behavior of human CC stem cells in vivo.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: HCT 116 human colon cancer cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Cells were treated with 1 &mu;M Smo-Inhibitor (Hh-Antag, provided by Genentech, Inc. &reg;) or vehicle for 48 hours. Conditioned medium samples (2 ml) were lyophilized then dissolved and finally homogenized by vortex mixing for 1 min. After centrifugation the supernatant was transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube and used for the NMR analysis. 2D 1H J-resolved (JRES) NMR spectra were acquired on a 500 MHz Varian/Agilent spectrometer using a double spin echo sequence with 4 transients per increment for a total of 32 increments. Metabolites responsible for the separation between treated and untreated samples were identified using an in-house NMR database and Chenomx NMR suite v. 7.7 (Chenomx Inc., Alberta, Canada). To compare the spectra, the integrals derived from the binning procedure were normalized to the total integral region, following exclusion of bins representing the residual water peak (d 4.33-5.17 ppm) and the TSP peak (d 0.5-0.5 ppm). The resulting data was used as input for multivariate analysis. The experiment was repeated three times.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:1H-NMR metabolomics profiles of HCT 116 cell culture media display significant differences between HhAntag-treated and vehicle-treated cells (p&lt;0.00001). The first component t1 included the following variables with the highest correlation levels: valine, alanine, N-acetyl groups, glutamate, pyruvate, succinate, tyrosine and phenylalanine. Therefore, considering the net balance of these metabolites, t1 indicates that HhAntag treatment induces higher consumption of pyruvate, succinate and tyrosine as well as a lower consumption of valine, glutamate and phenylalanine. Moreover, HhAntag-treated cells have higher production of alanine, acetate and N-acetyl groups compared to vehicle-tread ones.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our results show that treatment with a Smo selective inhibitor affects the metabolism of different amino acids. Moreover, it modifies the energetic metabolism of colon cancer cells, deregulating in particular the metabolism of nucleotide sugar, purine, pyrimidine and pyruvate, as well as citrate cycle (TCA cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, we can postulate that the inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway in colorectal cancer cells counteract tumor growth by modulating cellular energetic pathways.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","General Surgery"

Surgical coaching offers an innovative approach to improve performance, with content tailored to individual surgeons across these dimensions; however, little is known about surgeon willingness to participate. We sought to determine what motivated surgeons to participate and which dimension(s) surgeons are most interested in improving in a statewide video-based surgical coaching program.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We matched surgeons with a trained coach for review of intra-operative performance via video recordings of the surgeon's operations. Eight surgeons were recruited by peer nomination to serve as coaches and trained in concepts of coaching that include constructive feedback. We recruited twelve surgeons in academic and community practice to participate as coachees. An introductory conversation between coach and coachee was part of the program to set goals and discuss motivations for participation. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data about coachees' motivation and goals were analyzed using an inductive qualitative approach.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The most common motivation for participation was the view of self-improvement as an aspect of professional responsibility or 'the right thing to do'. Improvement goals included all three dimensions (technical, cognitive and interpersonal) of surgical performance. While the program was designed to focus on intra-operative performance, participants also identified performance targets outside of the operating room. Coachees fell into two broad categories: those making the transition to independent practice, and those who had been practicing surgeons for some time; these groups identified differing goals and challenges. Coachees transitioning to independence identified goals related to teaching and leadership. Common themes that emerged included challenges in working with non-trainee surgical assistants and 'operating from the other side of the table'. Additional goals included altering one's surgical practice to conform to institutional norms and protocols, and balancing clinical practice with other demands (teaching, research, and administrative) on one's time. In comparison, more senior surgeons identified goals related to the changing healthcare environment including staying abreast of current surgical practices, learning and incorporating new surgical procedures or techniques into practice, and adjusting to changing surgical culture.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Participants in a peer coaching program were self-motivated to improve and identified a variety of goals dependent on the stage of their career. While more research is needed, these results suggest surgeons are willing to participate in a video-based program and seek to address a variety of challenges. Surgical coaching represents a promising new approach for surgeons to improve aspects of their performance with a program tailored to their individual needs.","Education","Continuing Medical Education","Cross Disciplinary"

We sought to better understand medical student adoption of mobile technology, preferred resources and barriers to use of electronic applications for educational and clinical purposes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Third year medical students at a single institution were provided an Apple iPad mini for use during their required 6-week surgical clerkship. The iPads were pre-loaded with specific applications and bookmarked links to recommended references through the medical school library. Each device had access to the clerkship curriculum through the institutional learning management system, to the electronic medical record (EMR) and to required on-line learning modules. Students received training in the use of the iPad and the key apps during their clerkship orientation. At the conclusion of their surgery clerkship, students were invited to fill out an open-ended online survey identifying the most and least effective features of the iPad as a resource.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The survey response rate was 30% (n= 19/62).  Students identified that the most effective features of the iPad required access to Wi-Fi and included its portability and the access to didactic schedules, learning modules and the EMR. Least effective features included poor interface of some applications, which limited the use of the electronic medical record and didactic modules on the iPad. Students who chose not to use the iPad provided by the clerkship indicated that they already owned an iPad for personal use. Students who used clerkship-provided devices as well as those using their personal devices documented concerns about their potential financial liability if the loaned iPad was lost or damaged. Further, the iPad was felt to be of no value for students at one rotation site because of the absence of Wi-Fi in that hospital.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The use of an iPad during the surgical clerkship still has strong potential for both education and clinical applications.  However, students identified that the utility of the iPad for medical education during a surgical clerkship is limited by application interface and availability of Wi-Fi. Optimizing the design of applications for education and clinical purposes on the iPad mini may enhance the adoption of mobile technology during training and into clinical practice.","Education","Simulation Training (Technical and Non-technical)","Cross Disciplinary"

We aim to analyze the 100 most cited manuscripts in the field of thoracic surgery including non vascular, non cardiac thoracic pathologies. Analysis of this data provides insight into both the evolution of the understanding of thoracic pathobiology and to how the field of thoracic surgery has evolved in response. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A search of the citation indexing database Thomson Reuters Web of Science was completed using over 20 key words relevant to thoracic surgery. The top 100 cited manuscripts were further analyzed by topic, institution, author, journal and year.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 98,743 full length English language papers were returned. The New England Journal of Medicine and Radiology published the most papers in the top 100 with 13 each. The country with majority of publications in the top 100 was the USA (n=55). Memorial Sloan Kettering was the institution with the greatest number of manuscripts (n=8).  Orringer and Rusch had 3 first and 1 senior authorship each.

Although many are increasingly living in urban centers, refugee and IDP settlements are common. Persons living in these settlements are vulnerable to violent attacks with resultant fires and burn injuries. We aimed to describe the burden of intentional fires in these settlements, review humanitarian organization guidelines for fire control, and identify interventions and innovation to address any gaps.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A systematic review of academic (e.g. PubMed) andnon-academic (e.g. LexisNexis, humanitarian news wires) literature databases was conduced. MESH terms included:('Refugee' OR 'Displaced') AND ('Fire' OR 'Burn'). Only English language papers were included. Additionally, we reviewed fire prevention andcontrol guidelines from the 15 leading humanitarian organizations.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 1,521 records, 131 described distinct settlementfires in 31 host countries since 1990. From 2000 to 2014 intentional fires increased from 0.003 to 0.01 fires per 100,000 persons, respectively. Incidents were classified as: unintentional (36, 27%); intentional(26, 19%); unknown cause (43, 33%); with 26 reports not reporting a cause. Intentional fires resulted in 329 deaths, 359 burn injuries,139,498 displaced individuals, and destruction of 16,142 shelters. Sudan had the most intentional incidents (11, 42% of intentional fires).Humanitarian organization guidelines only focused on prevention and control of unintentional fires(e.g. cooking-related fires). Guidelines did recommended firebreaks and outlined security protocols including disarming residents and using local police or international military to prevent attacks. No guidelines specified fire alerting, response,extinguishing, or reporting. Interventions and innovations identified included: more fuel-efficient stoves to reduce deforestation by the settlement residents to prevent upsetting local residents; fire retardant shelter material to prevent fires from spreading; fire alert bells; regularly spaced water/sand buckets for extinguishing fires; and volunteer fire services to aid control of both intentional and unintentional fires.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Violent attacks and intentional fires are increasing in refugee and IDP settlements. Significant numbers of injuries and further displacement highlight the need to address gaps in fire prevention and control guidelines. The way forward includes: i) improving and developing consensus among humanitarian organization for fire prevention and control strategies; ii) evaluating the impact of interventions and innovations on the burden of intentional fires; and iii) engaging organizations and groups responsible for settlement maintenance in a broader discussion about protecting settlement residents from armed groups.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

While there are increasing data on surgical and infrastructure needs from low and middle income countries, there is a paucity of data from many parts of the world such as the South Pacific. The archipelago islands of the South Pacific have a distinct geography that requires patients from remote islands to be transported to the nearest large island health facility for higher levels of care. In addition to their baseline surgical needs, these islands also have high rates of surgical diseases including Hirschprung's disease, thyroid cancer and congenital diaphragmatic hernias. The purpose of this study was to search the published literature to characterize the surgical needs and capacity of this region.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using PRISMA guidelines, a search of PubMed with the following MeSH terms: 'Pacific Island' and 'Surgery' were used to identify relevant titles and abstracts. The search was restricted to reviews of surgical outcomes, analyses of hospital infrastructure, and surgical training program reports from 2005-2015. Case reports were excluded. South Pacific islands were restricted to Melanesia (Fiji, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands), Micronesia (Guam, Palau, Kiribati, Nauru, Marshall Islands, Federal States of Micronesia), and Polynesia (Pitcalm Island, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, Cook Islands). Country data were also collected from the World Health Organization.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The search identified 29 papers meeting inclusion criteria. Of these, 13 articles reviewed surgical outcomes of the following: valve replacements (5), cataract surgery (4), large-vessel injuries of the neck (1), penetrating abdominal wounds (1), perforated appendicitis (1), and airway scleromas (1). 7 articles addressed surgical training and the 'brain drain' of the medical work force. 4 articles evaluated access to surgical care.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Limited data on surgical needs and capacity are documented from the South Pacific.

Most commonly, these include congenital colorectal conditions such as anorectal malformations (ARM) and Hirschsprung Disease (HD), and acquired conditions such as typhoid perforation and intussusception with bowel gangrene. These conditions more frequently require an ostomy in an LMIC, most commonly due to late presentation. In this Ugandan national referral hospital pediatric surgery ward, over half of all patient hospital days are due to HD or ARM, underscoring the local clinical burden. This pilot study of socioeconomic assessment of the impact of these conditions was designed to inform a larger mixed methods study.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A literature search was performed concerning pediatric general surgical conditions requiring ostomies in LMICs, and their socioeconomic impact, in multiple databases, yielding no results. A broader search of the social and economic impact of other congenital anomalies yielded several publications for clubfoot, cleft lip/palate, neural tube defects, and cardiac defects. Some of these studies were adapted to design themes for focus group discussions (2) and directed questions for individual interviews (15) of mothers of children with ostomies in the inpatient and outpatient setting. Selected themes covered: cost of care, beliefs about illness, socioeconomic impact children and families, and sources of economic and social support.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Mothers in both individual interviews and focus groups had a very limited understanding of the conditions that led to the need for a stoma, but all acknowledged the necessity. The majority of mothers limited interaction of their child with others in the community for fear of stigma. The management of stoma with cloth shreds was the most common method for stoma care in the absence of stoma supplies, with the resulting odor and associated hygiene challenges the most disturbing feature. Nearly all working mothers reported leaving their jobs to care for the child, and many reported selling assets such as livestock and taking out loans to cover out of pocket expenses for health care, despite seeking care in 'free' public facilities. Over half of the mothers reported that their spouse left the family after the stoma was placed. Nearly all the mothers emphasized the support from the 'informal' community of affected parents on the ward, and in the outpatient setting.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This limited pilot survey underscores the significant impact of conditions requiring stomas on children and their families. Children are socially excluded and families are frequently impoverished due to catastrophic health expenditure. The informal network of affected families plays a significant supportive role.

This barrier to dissemination of new surgical knowledge limits the transmission of up-to-date surgical information to surgeons and practitioners in these countries.  We hypothesize that open access peer-reviewed electronic surgical journals can facilitate the dissemination of up to date surgical knowledge to those with limited resources in LMIC.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We investigated a US-based non-profit open-access peer-reviewed electronic surgical journal (ePlasty), intended to make current surgical literature available in LMIC.  All articles published through this journal between May 2012 and May 2015 were reviewed.  Data collected from the editorial office included the number of articles per year, type of article, country of origin of submissions, rejection rate, and operating costs.  Journal access data including the frequency of online access and geographic location of access was obtained from the website-monitoring service Web-Stat.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In this 3-year period, the journal published 286 original open-access articles.  The average number of submissions/year was 115 articles with a 30% rejection rate.

Approximately 70-80% of patients older than 18 months present with metastatic disease and less than half of these patients are cured. Curcumin (C) has displayed anticancer activities in different cancer types, including neuroblastoma. Nanoceria (CNPs) has recently shown toxicity to neuroblastoma in a size and dose-dependent manner. Dextran(Dx)-CNPs possess pH-dependent therapeutic activities: cytoprotection of nontransformed cells and oxidative damage of cancer cells. We hypothesize that the combination of nanoceria with curcumin can acquire synergic activity against neuroblastoma. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Several formulations of C-CNPs and Dx-C-CNPs were synthesized by varying CNPs concentrations (5 and 10mM) and curcumin load (1-2mg/ml). Physico-chemical properties of the formulations were analyzed by DLS, FT-IR, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, DSC, ICP-MS, and TEM. Two neuroblastoma cell lines (SK-N-AS and IMR-32) were used for testing the formulations. Anticancer effects of the formulations were characterized by MTT and ROS assay at different time points. Bare CNPs and curcumin were used as controls. Signaling pathway of particle-induced apoptosis was studied by qPCR, TUNEL assay, and caspase 3/7 assay. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Screening of the formulations with MTT (24h) revealed that a higher starting CNPs:curcumin ratio was more effective. Concentration- and time-dependent anticancer effect of the formulations was observed. HUVEC cells were exposed to both types of formulations as control cells and no cytotoxic effect was established. IMR-32 appeared to be more sensitive towards the treatment, probably due to a more intensive uptake of nanoparticles (28-55% after 2h of exposure). Dx-C-CNPs formulation showed the highest amount of ROS which was dependent on time of incubation. This formulation was more effective for IMR-32 with45% cell viability vs 55% when C-CNPs were used (250uM, 72h of treatment). Maximum C-CNPs uptake by SK-N-AS was found in 4h after loading (78%) and ROS accumulation was at the highest level after 10h of treatment. Formulation with double the curcumin load (C2-CNPs) allowed stimulation of continued ROS production over time in SK-N-AS. A higher degree of SK-N-As apoptosis  was observed for C2-CNPs (58% of survival cells, 24h), in agreement with ROS assay data. The longer treatment (72h) improved the toxic effect of Dx-C-CNPs for the SK-N-AS line with 53%  cell survival vs 64% for C-CNPs.

However, the non-targeted nature of ICG has led to a high false positive detection rate that limits its diagnostic potential.  We propose to localize pulmonary adenocarcinomas with a novel NIR dye targeted to folate receptor alpha (FR&alpha;), OTL38<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The presence of FR&alpha; was measured on 24 human samples of pulmonary adenocarcinomas using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry.  Then, NOD scid gamma mice with KB flank tumors were imaged with a NIR camera at various time points following tail vein injection of several concentrations of OTL38 (from 0.05 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg).  The histopathology as well as fluorescence of vital organs from OTL38 were measured to assess biodistribution and toxicity.  Lastly, intrapleural KB tumors were established to assess smallest detectable tumor using NIR imaging.  All tumor samples were correlated with fluorescence microscopy and final pathology.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty out of 24 human tumor samples expressed FR&alpha; with minimal staining of surrounding stroma and immune cells.  FR&alpha; co-localized to EpCam+ (epithelial cell marker) cells with no co-expression with CD45 (immune cell marker) or CD11b (myeloid cell marker) cells.  In 17 specimens, FR&alpha; was expressed on 76% &plusmn; 28% (range 36-99%) of EpCam+ tumor cells.  In the remaining 3 samples FR&alpha; was expressed on &lt;10% EpCam+ tumor cells.  Immunohistochemistry confirmed these findings showing strong staining on samples with a large FR&alpha;+ population.  In our murine flank model, tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) peaked at 3 hours after injection and were similar at OTL38 dose of 0.075 mg/kg and above, making 0.075 mg/kg the lowest effective dose.  Mean TBR of mice injected with 0.075 mg/kg at the three-hour time point was 3.2 (IQR 2.4-4.1).  Fluorescent signal was noted only in the kidneys and GI tract, which is consistent with high levels of FR&alpha; within the proximal tubules and the hepatic clearance of OTL38.  In our intrapleural model, the smallest tumors detectable by NIR imaging were discovered on days 4 and 5 following tumor cell inoculation.  These tumors were 1.03 mm +/- 0.22 with a mean TBR of 3.1 +/- 0.29.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: OTL38 successfully localizes to pulmonary adenocarcinomas during NIR intraoperative molecular imaging.

As the wait list continues to grow, efforts to improve utilization of uncontrolled donation after cardiac death (DCD) lungs is necessary to expand the donor pool.  We hypothesized that ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) would allow for rehabilitation of DCD lungs after prolonged periods of warm ischemia time with resultant oxygenation capacities acceptable for transplantation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Porcine donor animals were intubated, anesthetized, and subjected to hypoxic cardiac arrest, followed by various periods of warm ischemia time prior to lung procurement.  Three groups (n=3/group) that differed by warm ischemia time (60, 90, or 120 minutes) were compared.  Following warm ischemia, lungs were flushed with cold preservation solution, procured, and subjected to 4 hours of normothermic EVLP.  At each hour of perfusion, lungs were challenged with 100% FiO<sub>2</sub> and perfusate samples were obtained for PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> calculations.  Lungs were ventilated with protective tidal volumes of 8 mL/kg and 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O of positive end-expiratory pressure.  Airway pressures were monitored at each hour allowing for calculation of dynamic lung compliance. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Mean PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> values consistently improved over all 4 hours of EVLP in all three groups (Figure 1).  There was a decrease in mean PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> values in the 120 min of warm ischemia group compared to both the 60 min and 90 min groups at all four time points.  The final mean PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> values after 4 hours of EVLP were not significantly different (518.3&plusmn;33.7, 539.3&plusmn;19.0 mmHg, and 466.1&plusmn;49.5 mmHg in the 60, 90, and 120 min groups, respectively).

The adult response to MI is associated with left ventricle remodeling that results in significant cardiac myocytes loss and increase in fibrotic tissue formation which eventually lead to heart failure. In contrast, the normal fetal response to MI results in regeneration of functional myocardium. We have shown that inhibition of stromal-derived factor-1&alpha; (SDF-1&alpha;) in the fetal infarct blocks the recruitment of cardiac progenitor cells and results in a lack of regeneration, similar to the adult response. We hypothesize that this lack of regeneration is due to increased inflammatory response and inflammatory cell infiltration<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  To test this hypothesis, 20% apical infarcts were created in adult and fetal sheep by LAD ligation.  In a subset of fetal sheep, the infarcts were injected with a lentivirus containing the SDF-1&alpha; inhibitor transgene or control. Hearts were harvested 3 or 30 days following infarction. Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function and infarct size. Histology was used to assess inflammatory cells infiltration and scar formation.  Real-time PCR was used to assess IL-6, IL-8, and NFkB gene expression.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: At 3 days following MI, we observed significant infarcts in both fetal and adult hearts. At 30 days, the adult heart showed infarct expansion and decreased function. In contrast, the fetal hearts demonstrated resolution of the akinetic myocardium and restoration of cardiac function.  At 3 and 30 days, fetal infarcts had significantly lower NFkB, IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression whereas in the adults it was significantly higher in the infarct area at both time-points. SDF-1&alpha; inhibition transformed the regenerative fetal response into a reparative response similar to the adult.  At 30 days, fetal hearts treated with the SDF-1&alpha; inhibitor demonstrated a significant increase in infarct size as well as scar formation. SDF-1&alpha; inhibition resulted in increased IL-6, IL-8, and NFkB gene expression.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results demonstrate that the fetal regenerative response to MI is dependent on the recruitment of cardiac progenitor cells mediated by SDF-1&alpha;. These recruited progenitor cells may create an environment conducive to restoration of functional myocardium by altering the inflammatory response. These findings provide the first evidence that SDF-1&alpha; plays a role in the regulation of inflammation and or scar formation.  Further studies are need to define the role of progenitor cell recruitment in promoting fetal cardiac regeneration.","Basic Science","Cardiovascular Biology/Physiology","Cardiothoracic"

Consequently, there is an intensive effort to investigate the transplantation of pluripotent cells as a viable therapy for the regeneration of myocardial tissue and preservation of cardiac function. Cellular cardiomyoplasty by intravenous, intracoronary, or direct injection is a popular strategy to restore cardiac function. However, issues with cell retention and engraftment limit this approach. To address this, it has been proposed that in vitro microenvironments in the form of a cardiac patch can be developed that recapitulate the appropriate physical cues found natively in the heart, leading to improved cellular functionality and organization. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of an electrospun conductive polymer scaffold to effectively organize and enhance cellular interconnectivity of pluripotent dedifferentiated adipose (DFAT) cells.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: To fabricate the scaffolds, PCL, gelatin, and melanin were dissolved in HFIP (10% w/v) and electrospun with a flow rate of 2.5 ml/hr, 20 kV, and spinneret-collector distance of 15 cm.  Fibers were collected on a rotating mandrel (3000 RPM) to create aligned fibers. The resulting scaffolds were characterized by SEM, ATR-FTIR, and Instron tensile testing. Primary DFAT cells were obtained from the dedifferentiation of mature murine adipocytes. After 5 days of cultivation, the cells were seeded onto the PCL/gelatin/melanin hybrid scaffolds and cell viability, morphology, and orientation were assessed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Our results demonstrate the ability to successfully fabricate aligned nanofibrous scaffolds from electrospun PCL/gelatin/melanin polymers. The incorporation of melanin was successfully confirmed by ATR-FTIR analysis.  Elastic modulus was decreased with the addition of melanin in the scaffold compared to control PCL scaffolds, but was closer to literature values for native myocardium. The aligned fiber material demonstrated good biocompatibility, promoted cell attachment, and effectively directed cell orientation along the fiber direction.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Electrospun PCL/gelatin/melanin hybrid scaffolds with aligned fibers support the regulation of pluripotent DFAT cell organization and interconnectivity. The incorporation of conductive melanin component may allow the electrospun scaffold to support electrical stimulation of the DFAT cells to augment their functionality as a cardiac patch.

Previously we reported that gain-of-function (constitutive active) RAF1 mutations are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and causes early death in Noonan Syndrome (NS) but the role of gain of function RAF1 mutation in cardiac fibroblasts (CF) remain to be explored.  NS is an autosomal dominant disorder and about 20% of patients are present with HCM which is the leading cause of death in these children and young adults. We hypothesized that gain of function RAF1 play an important role in the regulation of cardiac fibroblast (CF) biology with regards to myofibroblast transformation, increased collagen synthesis, and myocardial fibrosis which are important in the development of Heart Failure (HF).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: CFs were isolated from the LV of adult Sprague-Dawley rats.

In addition, we have previously shown higher levels of SDF-1 in female hearts compared to male hearts after acute ischemia/reperfusion. Depletion of endogenous estrogen by ovariectomy (OVX) decreased post-ischemic SDF-1 production in female hearts, while exogenous estrogen treatment restored myocardial SDF-1 level in OVX females (OVX F). Notably, SDF-1 is an important factor of chemoattraction for stem cell homing, thus able to initiate stem cell-based repair.

We investigated this hypothesis in a rodent model of normokalemic perfusion and potassium cardioplegia.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Groups of male Sprague-Dawley rat hearts (n=4 per group) were perfused with either standard Krebs-Heinseleit buffer or potassium modified (20mM) Krebs-Heinseleit buffer (to simulate potassium cardioplegia) containing physiological concentrations of fatty acids (.35mM), ketones (.17mM), lactate (1.2mM), pyruvate (.12mM), and glucose (5.5mM) with different Carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C) labelling patterns.

RV recovery tissue showed a return to the control transcriptome.  Absolute calcium was increased in RV failure and recovery cells.  Increase of calcium transient amplitude was observed in RVR compared to RVF, which indicates sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium might be partially restored during RVR. Decay of time constant of calcium transient was prolonged in both RVR and RVR suggesting reduced calcium update. This change in calcium metabolism likely plays a role in abnormalities of excitation-contraction-coupling.

RAG-/- mice were subjected to T-cell transfer colitis by IP injection of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> na&iuml;ve T-cells from either CAMKIV KO mice or WT counterparts.  Animal weights and disease activity index (DAI) were recorded daily.  Intestinal tissue was analyzed for expression of inflammatory cytokines, generation of reactive oxygen species, and changes in barrier function.  H&amp;E staining was used to evaluate histological changes. Immunofluorescence was used to observe differences in the quantity and localization of key proteins as well as to identify infiltrating bacteria within the intestinal mucosa. Infiltrating intestinal epithelial T-cells were isolated and measured for purity using flow cytometry and separate nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were extracted for analysis. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: WT mice subjected to DSS displayed increased levels of activated CAMKIV within the nucleus of infiltrating T-cells within the intestinal mucosa relative to cytoplasmic fractions. CAMKIV-deficient mice subjected to DSS were protected from intestinal inflammation relative to their WT counterparts, as demonstrated by H&amp;E staining, PCR, and immunofluorescence. KO mice also demonstrated a decrease in HMGB1 activation within the intestine as compared to WT mice. Mice subjected to T-cell transfer experimental colitis with CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> CAMKIV-deficient T-cells were protected when compared to mice receiving CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T-cells from WT mice. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We investigate for the first time the role of CAMKIV in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation.  We demonstrate that the global absence of CAMKIV confers protection against murine experimental colitis, while the presence of CAMKIV predisposes to inflammation.  Nuclear shuttling of activated CAMKIV in T-cells likely activates transcription of downstream regulators of inflammation, such as HMGB1, and contributes to murine colitis.  Strategies aimed at suppressing CAMKIV activity may lead to novel treatment strategies for human IBD.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","General Surgery"

Although inhalation of low concentrations of hydrogen gas been reported to prevent various diseases, solubilized hydrogen may be a portable, easily- administered, and safer/more practical means of hydrogen gas treatment. Therefore, we hypothesized that intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of hydrogen-saturated physiological saline would ameliorate postoperative ileus in mice.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Ileus was induced via surgical manipulation (SM) of male C57BL/6 mice. Under general anesthesia, ileus was induced by applying two cotton-tipped applicators to the small intestine, using a rolling motion. Hydrogen-saturated physiological saline was produced by mixing saline with hydrogen gas using a pressure-resistant container (hydrogen concentration was 1.0 ppm and more, equivalent to 0.46mM). After SM, the peritoneal cavity was filled with 1.0mL of either physiological saline or hydrogen-saturated physiological saline that was inoculated into the peritoneal cavity before closure of the abdominal incision. Intestinal transit of a non-absorbable, fluorochrome-labeled dextran was assessed 24 hours postoperatively. The sham-surgery group underwent abdominal incision and closure without surgical manipulation. Griess reaction was performed to measure nitric oxide (NO) release form the muscularis extema in 24 h organ culture.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:SM resulted in a marked delay in intestinal transit associated with proinflammatory cytokine expression compared with sham controls. Bowel dysmotility induced by SM was attenuated by intraabdominal administration of hydrogen-saturated saline. Real time RT-PCR indicated increased mRNA levels for intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) after SM. Hydrogen-saline significantly reduced the upregulation of these inflammatory markers. The muscularis whole mount from sham-operated animals treated with saline or hydrogen-saline was virtually devoid of myeloperoxidase-positive leukocytes. SM was associated with extensive leukocyte infiltration 24 hrs after SM when treated with saline; however, this extravasation was significantly decreased when hydrogen-saline was i.p. administered. While NO production increased after SM, hydrogen significantly reduced NO levels in organ culture six hours after SM.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A single i.p. dose of hydrogen-saturated physiological saline ameliorates postoperative ileus by inhibiting the inflammatory response and NO production.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","General Surgery"

We recently found that infiltrating neutrophils form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and exacerbate sterile inflammatory injury during liver I/R. However, whether damaged LSECs can release signals to stimulate NET production is unknown. We thus sought to determine the role ofIL-33, a novel inflammatory mediator mainly released from LSECs, in NET formation during liver I/R.Methods.WT or IL-33 KO mice (both n=12) were subjected to a non-lethal warm liver I/R model of 1h ischemia followed by blood and tissue sampling after 1 h and 6h of reperfusion. The effects of recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) or soluble ST2 (sST2, decoy receptor of IL-33) wereinvestigated. In vitro, isolated WT and IL-33 KO LSECs were exposed to hypoxia (1% O2) and co-cultured with neutrophils in the absence or presence of rIL-33, IL-33 neutralizing antibody (Ab), or sST2 to evaluate NET formation.Results.IL-33 KO mice or sST2-treated WT mice were significantly protected from I/R injury, having significantly less serum sALT and hepatic necrosis, lower levels of systemic cytokines (IL-6, TNF-&alpha;), and abrogation of MAP-kinase proinflammatory signaling pathways, compared to WT mice. rIL-33 administered during I/R exacerbated hepatotoxicity and systemic inflammation. Although significant neutrophil infiltration was found in both IL-33 KO and WT mice, NET formation was decreased in IL-33 KO mice during liver I/R compared with WT mice, as evidenced by a significant reduction inserum levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA complexes, and in tissue levels of citrullinated-histone H3 (which are known NET markers). In addition, treatment of WT mice with sST2 reduced NET formation, whereas rIL-33 significantly increased numbers of NETs after liver I/R. In vitro, IL-33 released from LSECs that were subjected to hypoxia promoted NET formation. Directly stimulating neutrophils with rIL-33 confirmed the activation of the IL-33/ST2-MyD88 signaling pathway in NET formation. NET formation was blocked in experiments using IL-33 KO LSECs, as well as in the presence of IL-33 neutralizing Ab or sST2. Conclusion.Our study demonstrates that IL-33 released from hypoxic LSECs during liver I/R stimulates neutrophils to form NETs, leading to excessive inflammation and hepatotoxicity.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","General Surgery"

Ayala<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Brown University School Of Medicine,Surgery,Providence, RI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  iNKT cells are a group of regulatory T cells that are critical in coordinating immune response, and are implicated in various immunological diseases. The recently described group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) may have an important role in crosstalk between innate and adaptive aspects of the immune response, and they are implicated in lung inflammation and allergic responses. These cells differentiate from their precursor cells with stimulation by IL-25 as well as IL-33, and result in the secretion of Th-2 associated cytokines including interleukins (IL)-5, -9 and -13. As such, they may contribute to immunosuppression in polymicrobial sepsis. Previously, we demonstrated, in murine model of sepsis, that iNKT cells are required to illicit production of IL-33. We hypothesize that iNKT cells would, in a similar fashion, affect the expression of IL-25 in the circulating blood, peritoneal fluid and in the liver in sepsis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and sham laparotomy were performed in both wildtype (WT) C57BL/6 and iNKT-/- mice. At various time points (6, 12, and 24 hours) following surgery, mouse serum, peritoneal fluid and liver tissues were harvested, and IL-25 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In septic WT mice, there was a rapid decline in liver IL-25 levels, starting as early as 6 hours (54.8 vs 108pg/ml; p=0.009) and persisting for up to 24 hours (59.3 vs 108pg/ml; p=0.034) following CLP, in keeping with previous observations of the rapid and persistent migration of iNKT cells from the liver. iNKT-/- mice demonstrated low baseline levels of liver IL-25, which were unchanged by sepsis throughout the time course (49.1 vs 62.1pg/ml at 24hrs post-CLP; p=0.63). CLP did not induce any changes in serum IL-25 levels in WT mice compared to sham (7.0 vs 11.0pg/ml at 24 hours; p=0.21). However, in iNKT-/- mice, sepsis resulted in a rapid and persistent decline in IL-25 levels (3.3 vs 15.6pg/ml at 24 hours; p=0.01). In the peritoneal cavity, we noted an early decline in IL-25 levels in septic WT mice (5.8 vs 16.7pg/ml at 6 hours; p=0.03), but this was noted to rise by 24 hours (9.3pg/ml), in keeping with the known migration of iNKT cells into the peritoneal cavity. iNKT-/- mice did not demonstrate changes in peritoneal IL-25 levels following CLP.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The observation that hepatic IL-25 levels decrease with concomitant initial decline, followed by rise of IL-25 in the peritoneal cavity is consistent with our previous data describing iNKT cell migration from the liver to the peritoneal cavity in animal models of peritonitis. This further supports the notion that iNKT cells modulate the expression of IL-25, which is a known stimulator/activator of ILC2s. Further work will elucidate the exact mechanisms and potential pathways underlying the interactions between iNKT cells and ILC2s.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","General Surgery"

Previous work in our lab has shown that UDCA promotes enterocyte migration in vitro using rat intestinal epithelial cells. However, the effect of UDCA on enterocyte migration in vivo is unknown. We propose that the protective effects of UDCA are related to its ability to enhance intestinal wound closure. Therefore, we hypothesized that UDCA would protect against inflammation and intestinal barrier breakdown in experimental peritonitis by promoting enterocyte migration. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  C57/Bl6 wild-type mice were used in all experiments. Sixteen hours prior to sacrifice, mice were orally gavaged fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran with or without 100mg/kg UDCA and injected with 30mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally (IP). 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) was administered IP 2 hours prior to sacrifice. Blood samples were analyzed for FITC-dextran levels to determine barrier breakdown. Intestinal tissue was analyzed for mRNA expression and was stained for cell migration and proliferation using an EdU assay, as well as for apoptosis using the TUNEL assay. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Four mice were included in each group. Compared to controls, UDCA increased villus height and enterocyte migration but did not affect enterocyte proliferation. UDCA decreased apoptosis and barrier breakdown in mice injected with LPS compared to levels seen in untreated animals.

Its overdose (intentional or accidental) has led to thousands of deaths over the last decade nationally. APAP overdose can lead to fulminant hepatic failure as glutathione stores in the liver are depleted resulting in increased accumulation of toxic metabolites. The role of Damage Associated Molecular Pattern molecules (DAMPs)  as contributors to hepatoxicity is well established, especially the role of the DAMP High Mobility Group Box One (HMGB1). Here we present data showing that mice treated THERAPEUTICALLY with the first generation- protease inhibitor saquinavir (SQV) present with significantly attenuated liver failure.Methods : We used a murine model of APAP overdose:  Mice were fasted for 14hrs followed by injection with  an APAP overdose (400mg/kg. i.p). Three hrs after the overdose injection mice were treated therapeutically with saquinavir (5mg/kg) or the vehicle itself as control. Mice were sacrificed at 12hrs post APAP injection and analyzed for the development of liver failure using the following endpoints: A) serum analysis for AST/ALT levels, B) histologic evaluation of liver necrosis, C) Western blot analysis of liver tissue for mechanistic studies.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT with SAQUINAVIR three hrs post APAP overdose led to significantly lowered ALT/AST values compared to vehicle treated controls alone. Evaluation of H&amp;E stained liver sections also presented significanlty less tissue necrosis. Furthermore, HMGB1 levels were attenuated in mice treated therapeutically with SQV. Western blot analysis of liver homogenate points to a mechanism involving apoptosis as we observed distinct changes in the protein expression of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (Parp), beclin-1 and caspase-3.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Here show for the first time that the protease inhibitor SQV has  great potential for drug repurposing. Saquinavir demonstrates strong THERAPEUTIC value in this murine model of APAP induced acute liver failure leading to decreased HMGB1 release and significant decreased levels of apoptosis.Clinical Significance: The identification of HMGB1  as a target of SQV could potentially allow for a rapid transition of the discovery to the bedside, by re-purposing a drug already approved by the FDA with a well-known safety profile.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","General Surgery"

This risk has been attributed to the pro-inflammatory state, which is known to upregulate coagulation. In trauma, the inflammatory response to injury causes resistance (shutdown) to tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) mediated fibrinolysis which is associated with multiple organ failure and VTE. This shutdown is mediated through regulatory proteases, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). We hypothesize that obese patients exhibit fibrinolysis shutdown that is driven by chronic inflammation and regulatory proteases, and that this will be normalized by weight loss. MethodsTwenty three subjects meeting NIH criteria for morbid obesity and bariatric surgery were enrolled in this study. 11 patients were evaluated preoperatively (Pre) and 12 patients (9 roux-en-y gastric bypass and 3 sleeve gastrectomy) had blood samples obtained 6 months postoperatively (Post). Citrated native thromboelastography (TEG) was performed with the addition of tPA (150 ng/ml) to quantify fibrinolysis resistance, measured by the lysis at 30 minutes after maximum clot strength (LY30). These results were compared to a group of 137 healthy, non-obese subjects (HS). Fibrinolysis was measured using the percent lysis at 30 minutes after maximum clot strength is achieved (LY30). Targeted proteomic analysis of 129 coagulation-related proteins were performed in each sample. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test with a two-tailed alpha of 0.05.ResultsThe Pre and Post groups were comparable with median age (40 vs 42 years; p=0.9), pre- op Body Mass Index (BMI) (41.3 vs 45.9 p=0.60), and gender (82% vs 75% female). The Post group had a reduced post-op BMI of 30.5 (p&lt;0.001) at 6 months. The HS group was younger (31 years) with lower BMI (24) and was 52% female. The Pre group exhibited reduced LY30 compared to the HS group (8% vs 53%; p&lt;0.0001) and the Post group (8% vs 21%; p=0.016). Proteomic analysis identified that 11% of proteins analyzed differed between Pre and Post groups, including a 21% reduction in vitronectin in the Post group (p=0.007), but no difference in PAI-1.ConclusionPreoperatively, obese patients exhibit fibrinolysis shutdown compared to controls. Six months after surgery tPA sensitivity is markedly improved, which correlates with weight loss. While PAI-1 levels were unchanged, other coagulation proteins differed, including lower levels of post-op vitronectin. This finding suggests the pathologic basis for hypercoagulability may differ between populations, and warrants further study of these differences in order to develop pathology-specific anti-thrombotic strategies.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","General Surgery"

This may in part be due to initial platelet hyperactivation but a subsequent decrease in platelet function, referred to as exhausted platelet syndrome. We have previously demonstrated that histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) treatment attenuates coagulation imbalance and increase platelet activation following injury. We now investigate whether this could be due to a direct effect of HDACIs on platelets following injury.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Eleven female Yorkshire swine were anesthetized and instrumented in our established model of Traumatic Brian Injury (TBI) and hemorrhagic shock (HS). Blood samples were drawn prior to TBI+HS insult (healthy group) and two hours following hemorrhagic shock (shock group).

Conversely, in shock blood TEG alpha angle and maximum amplitude (MA) were significantly increased in the VPA group, indicating increased clot formation rate and strength (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01, respectively).  Similarly, TubA significantly decreased ASPI- (p&lt;0.01) and ADP- (p&lt;0.05) induced platelet aggregation, while significantly increasing TEG clot strength (MA, p&lt;0.05).  Both HDACIs exhibited variable effects on fibrinolysis.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the first study to investigate the direct effects of HDACI on platelet function ex vivo.  Our results suggest that HDACI decrease ADP, ASPI and COL platelet hyperactivation but improve overall clot strength in shocked whole blood, indicating a selective platelet sparing effect while maintaining clot strength integrity. This may be mediated through inhibition of HDAC6. These findings may in part explain the previously observed prevention of platelet exhaustion following VPA resuscitation in vivo.

Liechty<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Colorado Denver, Laboratory For Fetal And Regenerative Biology,Department Of Surgery,Aurora, CO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Complications of diabetes, such as the development of a chronic wound, represent a significant clinical problem.  The etiology of this wound healing impairment is multifactorial and includes a decreased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) or collagen.  We have previously shown that murine diabetic wounds are deficient in Stromal Derived Factor-1a (SDF-1a) and that treatment of diabetic wounds with SDF-1a can improve healing, however, the mechanisms of this correction are not well characterized.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the translation of mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level.  Specifically, MiRNA-25 has been shown to inhibit collagen protein synthesis. We have recently shown that miR-25 expression is increased in murine diabetic wounds. We hypothesized that the improved diabetic wound healing following treatment with SDF-1a is due, in part, to correction of the dysregulated miR-25 gene expression resulting in increased collagen hemostasis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: To test this hypothesis, 8mm full-thickness wounds were created on the flank of diabetic (Db/Db) and non-diabetic (Db/+) mice with a dermal punch instrument.  At the time of wounding, the wounds were treated with an intradermal injection with either 10<sup>8</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) of a lentivirus containing the SDF-1a or GFP transgene.  The wounds were harvested 7days after injury and processed for histology and isolation of total cellular RNA. We also isolated diabetic and non-diabetic dermal fibroblasts and treated them with either 10<sup>6</sup> PFU of a lentivirus containing the SDF-1a or GFP transgene. Gene expression was analyzed using Real-time PCR analysis. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:At 7 days, diabetic wounds treated with lenti-SDF-1a exhibited a significant decrease in wound surface area compared to lenti-GFP treated wounds. Morphologically, SDF-1-treated diabetic wounds demonstrated increased granulation tissue volume and cellularity compared to controls.  Diabetic wounds treated with SDF-1a also demonstrated a significant decrease in miR-25 expression, and a significant increase in the miR-25 targets Col1a1, compared to GFP treated diabetic wounds. At the cellular level, miR-25 was significantly up-regulated in diabetic fibroblasts at baseline, compared to non-diabetic fibroblasts. In addition, SDF-1a treatment corrected the miR-25 gene expression to levels similar to the non-diabetic fibroblast.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:SDF-1a mediated correction of the diabetic wound healing impairment is due, in part, to correction of dysregulated miR-25 expression.  Decreased expression of miR-25 may result in increased collagen homeostasis resulting in improved diabetic wound healing.  Further studies are needed to define the role of abnormal miRNA regulation in the pathogenesis of the diabetic wound healing impairment.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","General Surgery"

Volkmer et al. identified bladder tumor initiating cells (BTICs) in progressive stages of differentiation (1). We established patient derived xenografts (PDX) in order to study BTIC biology in vivo. We hypothesized that patient tumors with a greater population of basal or poorly differentiated BTICs would have a poor clinical outcome compared to patients with well-differentiated tumors. Gene expression analysis was performed with the goal of identifying prognostic markers.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients undergoing cystectomy are recruited under an IRB-approved protocol. Tumor samples are received from pathology; fragments are injected subcutaneously into the flank of NOD/SCID mice and monitored for engraftment. Remaining tissue is analyzed with flow cytometry to quantify the BTIC populations. Any tumors which engraft are excised, reimplanted into further generations of mice, and sorted for RNA extraction of the BTIC populations.

There was no correlation between engraftment and survival. However, a correlation between greater basal BTIC populations and overall survival approached significance (p=0.09).

The basal BTICs comprise an average of 1% of the tumor cells (range 0-17%). Early results indicate a differential response to cisplatin and radiation among PDX tumors for both agents. Analysis of the RNA array identified a signature of 54 genes suppressed in basal BTICs relative to the more differentiated tumor cells. This gene signature correlates with overall survival (p=0.0047) and disease-specific survival (p=0.0085) in a large cohort of patients.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our results suggest that the presence of a small percentage of basal BTICs portends a poor clinical outcome, which may be improved by the addition of chemotherapy. RNA evaluation of these BTICs has revealed potential biological markers and targets for future therapy, as well as a gene signature which may provide a tool for improved patient selection for therapy.

HCC tumors evade death in part by down-regulating IRF-1 expression, but the molecular mechanism accounting for IRF-1 suppression in HCC is not characterized. Previous studies showed that microRNA-23a(miR-23a) can suppress apoptosis by targeting IRF-1. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-23a promotes HCC by down-regulating IRF-1.   <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: For in vivo studies, seven cases of HCC and adjacent liver tissues were obtained from patients who underwent hepatectomy. For in vitro studies, IRF-1 mRNA and protein were examined in HepG2 and Huh7 HCC cells after IFN&gamma; stimulation. IRF-1 mRNA and protein expression was determined by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. To determine the role of miR-23a in regulating IRF-1, HepG2 cells were transfected by miR-23a mimic or inhibitor, and IRF-1 expression examined. Specific binding of miR-23a with IRF-1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) was assessed by cloning the 528-bp human IRF-1 3'-UTR sequence into reporter luciferase plasmid pMIR-IRF-1-3'UTR. Luciferase activity was performed in HCT116 cancer cells transfected with empty pMIR-Luc vector, pMIR-IRF-1 3'UTR, or pMIR-IRF-1 3-'UTR + miR-23a mimic or inhibitor. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: IRF-1 mRNA expression was down-regulated in 6 of 7 HCC human tumors compared to adjacent background liver (p&lt;0.001, Fig. A). IRF-1 protein was induced by IFN&gamma; stimulation in HepG2 cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. B). Addition of miR-23a mimic down-regulated IFN&gamma;-induced IRF-1 expression, while miR-23a inhibitor increased IRF-1 in HepG2 cells (Fig. B). Likewise, miR-23a inhibitor also increased IRF-1 mRNA and nuclear protein in Huh7 cells (data not shown). We identified a putative miR-23a binding element in the 3'-UTR of IRF-1. Ligation of the IRF-1-3'UTR decreased basal luciferase reporter activity in HCT116 cells. Addition of miR-23a mimic further repressed pMIR-IRF-1-3'UTR reporter activity, while miR-23a inhibitor restored the reporter activity (Fig. C).<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:These results demonstrate that 1) IRF-1 expression is down-regulated in resected human HCC tumors compared to background liver; 2) IRF-1 expression is induced by IFN&gamma; in HepG2 cells; 3) miR-23a downregulates the expression of IRF-1 in HCC cells, and 4) the IRF-1 3'-UTR has a miR23-a binding site that binds miR-23a and decreases reporter activity. These findings suggest that miR-23a targeting IRF-1 might be the molecular basis for IRF-1 down-regulation in HCC and provide new insight into miRNA regulation of HCC.","Basic Science","Cancer Genetics","Oncology"

Treatment options for these patients are limited, as they are not candidates for surgery and often prove to be unresponsive to chemotherapy. Current research efforts are, therefore, focused on understanding tumor biology with the goal of identifying new targets for therapy. Previous work in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer showed anabolic glucose metabolism to be essential for primary tumor growth. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is a key enzyme necessary for glucose uptake and processing that is commonly dysregulated in solid tumors. We aimed to assess the role of HK2 in promoting pancreatic cancer tumor growth and metastasis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Microarray gene expression data was analyzed from 149 primary and 61 metastatic pancreatic cancer tumors, and 47 normal pancreatic samples. Pancreatic cancer cell lines were stably transfected with doxycycline-inducible lentiviral shRNA constructs targeting either HK2 (shHK2) or a nonspecific control (shNS). Subcutaneous and tail vein injections of these lines were performed to monitor primary tumor growth and metastasis, respectively. Mice were treated with either doxycycline, to induce shRNA expression, or vehicle. Tumor growth was assessed biweekly using caliper measurements for 30 days of treatment, and mice were examined for lung metastasis using bioluminescence for 6 weeks after tail vein injection.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: HK2 was significantly upregulated in both primary and metastatic pancreatic tumors relative to normal pancreas. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high expression of HK2 in primary pancreatic tumors had a significantly worse overall survival (13 vs 21 months, p=0.033). Mice subcutaneously injected with shHK2 and treated with doxycycline to induce HK2 knockdown (n=9) had a significant decrease in tumor volume compared to those treated with vehicle (n=8, p=0.049). This tumor growth inhibition was not observed with the induction of shNS expression (shNS doxycycline vs. vehicle, p=0.339), suggesting that HK2 expression is necessary for primary tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, HK2 knockdown impaired the formation of lung metastasis. All control mice with tail vein injections of nonspecific shNS (n=7) developed lung metastasis during the six-week period, while only 2 out of 9 mice with HK2 knockdown developed metastasis (p=0.003).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results show that glycolytic enzyme HK2 has decreased expression in normal pancreas and is upregulated in pancreatic tumors. Furthermore, increased HK2 expression is associated with a poor clinical prognosis. In vivo studies support an important role for this gene in promoting both primary tumor growth and metastasis. Together, these results suggest HK2 may represent a good therapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","Basic Science","Cancer Genetics","Oncology"

We hypothesized that microRNAs function as signaling molecules between PC and TAS. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Monolayer co-culture was performed by seeding TAS and PC cells in 10:1 ratio. TAS and PC cells from co-culture were then separated by FACS using epithelial surface marker EpCam. Extracellular vesicles from PC conditioned media were isolated by differential centrifugation with size filtration. Total RNA from cultured cells and exosomes were isolated using Trizol. microRNA reverse-transcription and real-time PCR was performed using exiqon microRNA cDNA synthesis and PCR SYBR green kits. CXCL10 secretion was detected with BD OptEIA. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the panel of microRNAs analyzed, we focused on mir-205 as it was highly expressed in the PC cell lines (relative expression of 0.846 in copy number index normalized to mir-let-7a expression levels), yet all six primary cultures of TAS cells lacked mir-205 expression (relative expression of 0.008 in copy number index normalized to mir-let-7a levels). mir-205 was subsequently confirmed in vesicle preparations of conditioned media from PC cultures.  Following co-culture with PC cells and subsequent cell-sorting to purify the TAS cells, mir-205 expression was observed in the TAS lines (increased fold of 115.6&plusmn;4.2, p&lt;0.05).

Galandiuk<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Louisville School Of Medicine,Department Of Surgery, Division Of Colorectal Surgery,Louisville, KY, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergo preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation with approximately 70% exhibiting pathologic downstaging in response to treatment. Of these, 15-20% of patients exhibit 'complete pathologic response' with no remaining viable cancer. There is currently no accurate test to identify patients who are complete responders to neoadjuvant therapy who may be able to avoid undergoing radical surgery. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an antimetabolite drug that is widely used in the neoadjuvant treatment of rectal cancer. Genetic polymorphisms affect the activity of enzymes involved in 5-FU metabolism, such as thymidylate synthase (TYMS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenease (DPYD), and may also account for differing responses to neoadjuvant treatment seen in rectal cancer patients. Detection of such polymorphisms might permit identification of patients likely to have a complete response to neoadjuvant therapy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  DNA was isolated from whole blood taken from patients with newly diagnosed rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant therapy (n=54) and whole genome amplification was performed. Medical records were reviewed and a tumor regression score was given based on pre- and post-operative TNM staging. PCR was performed using previously published primers targeting the promoter region of TYMS. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 3% agarose gel to visualize if a patient was homozygous for a double-tandem repeat (2R), a triple-tandem repeat (3R), or heterozygous (2R/3R). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may also be present in the second repeat unit of the 3R allele. Restriction fragment length polymorphism assays were performed on patients with at least one 3R allele using HaeIII, a restriction enzyme that recognizes the GGCC sequence and cleaves between the second and third nucleotides. The fragments were separated by electrophoresis. For DPYD, single SNP assays were performed on two alleles with RT PCR. The major and minor alleles for each SNP fluoresced with different dyes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Successful DNA extraction, whole genome amplification, and PCR were confirmed by spectrophotometry. Of 54 patients, 14 patients were homozygous for 2R allele, 10 patients homozygous for 3R allele and 30 patients heterozygous for 2R/3R alleles. Patients with at least one TYMS 3R allele were more likely (OR 4 95% CI: 0.79 &ndash; 20.3) to have a complete pathologic response to treatment following 5-FU based neoadjuvant therapy than patients with two TYMS 2R alleles (p 0.07). Patients with at least one major allele in DPYD were more likely (OR 1.3 95% CI: 0.5 &ndash; 3.9) to exhibit pathologic downstaging with neoadjuvant therapy (p 0.5).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Identification of patients with specific genetic polymorphisms in enzymes involved in 5-FU metabolism appear to predict the likelihood of complete response of rectal cancer to preoperative 5-FU based neoadjuvant therapy and may alter surgical decision making.","Basic Science","Cancer Genetics","Oncology"

The overall incidence of CRC in the US has decreased over the past three decades, yet recent literature indicates alarming increase in incidence among individuals under the age of 50. More importantly, the younger patients present with more advanced and aggressive disease. Despite alarming increase in incidence of early-onset rectal tumors (EORC), the etiology is not quite understood. Increased frequency of EORC, poorer prognosis and lack of molecular data emphasizes a need for improved and novel molecular markers for use in the treatment and prognosis of this disease.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Two cohorts of patients with sporadic early- onset (EO) and late-onset (LO) rectal tumors were identified. We obtained tumor samples from six patients under age 50 and six patients over 65. We also obtained their matching non-involved tissues. Patients with Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis and inflammatory bowel disease were excluded from study. De-paraffinized tissues were macro-dissected from FFPE sections, RNA isolated and used for NanoString nCounter mRNA gene expression analysis to assess expression levels of up to 800 cancer genes. Statistical analysis was performed using the Gene Expression R-script module within the nCounter software v2.5. A gene was considered to be above background if the average count for the target gene was greater than the average counts for the eight negative control genes and if the P value of the t-test was less than 0.05.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We analyzed EORC and LORC tumors and compared their expression profiles to matched non-involved tissues in order to identify genes that are unique to rectal neoplasm. Out of 770 cancer pathway genes assayed, 275 genes were found to be differentially expressed between EORC and LORC. From all differentially expressed genes found in rectal tumors, the alterations in expression were statistically significant in 82 genes (p&lt;0.05). Seventy seven genes were uniquely expressed in EORC with 57 genes being up- and 20 genes down-regulated with a fold change higher than two.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This study suggests that early-onset rectal cancer might be characterized by distinct molecular events and represents a distinct molecular subtype from late-onset disease. Further studies using larger cohorts of patients might validate these findings and thus offer the possibilities of coming up with novel molecular markers that might enhance newer, faster and noninvasive detection modalities. Additionally, it might help in the advancement for the search of new chemotherapeutic agents that will ultimately improve overall survival of young patients with rectal tumors.","Basic Science","Cancer Genetics","Oncology"

Recently we found oligometastatic lesions are associated with the expression of several microRNAs located in a distinct microRNA cluster in chromosome 14 (14q32 locus, see ref. 1). This locus and chromosomal locus 19q13 represent two unique microRNA clusters in the human genome. They both are located in imprinted regions of the genome, where gene activity is regulated by allele-specific DNA methylation. We therefore hypothesized that DNA methylation is implicated in regulation of microRNAs associated with oligometastatic disease and located in methylation-dependent loci 14q32 and 19q13. We suggest that suppression of DNA methylation will reactivate these microRNAs and achieve an oligometastatic state.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  HCT116 cells were stably transfected by luciferase and tdTomato genes for in vivo and ex vivo monitoring of metastases development. Cells were treated by DNA-methyltransferase I (DNMT1) inhibitor 5'-Aza-C (5&mu;M) for 48 hours. Whole-genome differentially methylated CpG loci were assessed with Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. For whole-genome expressional profiling of mRNAs and microRNAs we used Illumina HT-12 bead arrays and Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. For ectopic expression of selected microRNAs (miR-127-3p, miR-329-3p, miR-382-5p and miR-432-5p) that were up-regulated after DNMT1 inhibitor treatment in vitro, HCT116 cells were transfected by microRNA mimics with subsequent intrasplenic injection of transfected cells to generate liver metastases. Growths of liver metastases were monitored based on in vivo luminescence with subsequent ex vivo fluorescent imaging as described in (2).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We found that limited demethylation of genomic DNA led to predominant reactivation of 14q32 and 19q13-encoded microRNAs. Using DIANA-microT and miRBase databases of predicted interactions between microRNAs and mRNAs we further found that ~80% of down-regulated genes can be explained by demethylation-dependent reactivation of microRNAs located in these two regions of the human genome. Methylation levels were significantly reduced in 78% of CpG loci in 14q32 after DNMT1 inhibitor treatment. Intrasplenic injection of HCT116 cells, ectopically expressing miR-382-5p led to the 1.5-fold reduction of liver metastases as compared with non-targeting control.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our findings represent first indication that microRNAs implicated in the development of clinical oligometastases may be regulated epigenetically by differential DNA methylation and target genes involved in metastases development.

Adjuvant therapies, including mitotane, have demonstrated efficacy, though frequently fail due to drug resistance. Complete R0 resection offers the only hope for a durable cure. In other cancers, cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated metabolism of anti-cancer agents has been shown to contribute to chemotherapy resistance. Recent comprehensive genetic analyses of ACCs by our group and others have shown recurrent arm-level copy number gains of chromosome 19 that carry a group of CYP genes. The role of these genes in adrenocortical carcinogenesis has yet to be clarified. Demonstrated functions of CYP enzymes in xenobiotic metabolism and biotransformation of carcinogenic compounds prompted us to investigate the potential influence of Chr 19q13 CYP genes in adrenocortical malignancy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using TaqMan real-time qPCR techniques, we investigated the expression patterns of seven CYP genes (CYP2A6, CYP2A7, CYP2A13, CYP2B6, CYP2F1, CYP2S1, &amp; CYP4F2) affected by predicted chromosome 19 copy gains in histologically confirmed ACC (n = 29) and normal adrenal cortex (n = 11). We used TaqMan copy number assays to verify the gene copy numbers in a subset of samples to assess the contribution of gene copy gains in promoting gene expression. Correlations between gene expression patterns and clinical parameters including patient age, gender, tumor size, pathological stage, metastatic status, and hormonal profile were also evaluated. Continuous variables and variables with &gt; 2 dependent values were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests, respectively. The Spearman correlation assessed matched continuous variables while categorical variables were analyzed with the Fisher's exact test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Two chromosome 19q13 CYP genes (CYP2A6 &amp; CYP2A7) showed increased overall expression levels compared to normal adrenal tissue (p &lt; .05). Increased expression of CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 was found in 98% of samples with average expression levels 25 (0.7-115.7) and 38 (1.8-368.1) fold greater than normal adrenal tissue. The remaining five CYP genes evaluated (CYP2A13, CYP2B6, CYP2F1, CYP2S1, &amp; CYP4F2) had unaltered or decreased expression levels compared to normal adrenal cortex. Copy number analysis of selected ACC samples showed copy gains of CYP2A6 in only 27% of specimens and no copy gains in CYP2A7, suggesting alternative mechanisms underlying CYP overexpression. Analysis of patient and tumor characteristics revealed a statistically significant relationship between &gt;10 fold overexpression of CYP2A6 and non-metastatic status (p &lt; .05).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Global increase in expression of CYP2A6 and CYP2A7, possibly independent of gene copy gains, was observed in 98% of ACC samples tested.

With challenging heterogeneity within the tumor subpopulation, prognostic factors for survival include age at diagnosis, tumor grade, tumor site, and MYCN amplification (MA). To this end, we focused on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) which we demonstrated in the past to have increased expression in pre-treatment NB cells with MA.  LncRNA Growth Arrest 5 (GAS5) is a putative tumor suppressor and promoter of apoptosis, which has known splice variants in other systems. Here, we investigate the role of lncRNA GAS5 splice variants in NB. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  MA (pre-treatment) and unamplified (UA) (post-treatment) cell lines were transfected with lncRNA GAS5 siRNA to decrease expression. Conversely, over-expression of lncRNA GAS5 was determined using functional expression cloning techniques.  During the cloning process, four lncRNA GAS5 splice variants were identified. Apoptosis and cell viability were measured after 24 hours using Caspase-Glo&reg; 3/7 Assay Systems and CellTiter 96&reg; AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS), respectively. Native expression of each variant was determined using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Knockdown and over-expression efficiency was also determined using qPCR. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In NB cell lines, we have shown increased expression of lncRNA GAS5 in a MA cell line compared to an UA line. Decreased lncRNA GAS5 expression caused a greater reduction in caspase activity in a MA line compared to an UA line. Decreased lncRNA GAS5 expression also resulted in less cell viability in a MA line and relatively no change in an UA line. During the cloning process, we observed various size fragments of lncRNA GAS5 and upon sequencing, at least four splice variants were observed. In the MA lines, GAS5 clone #2 expression was double that of the full length (FL) GAS5 clone. In UA cell lines, the expression of the clone #2 GAS5 variant was two-thirds of the expression of FL GAS5. We over-expressed two of these variants which resulted in differential effects in the cell biology assays. Caspase activity and cell viability in a MA line was more affected by the #2 variant compared to the UA line which was more regulated by the FL lncRNA GAS5 variant.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Knockdown of lncRNA GAS5 in a MA NB cell line resulted in decreased apoptosis and cell viability, while there seemed to be minimal effect of knockdown in an UA cell line. It is known that accumulation of lncRNA GAS5 results in decreased levels of apoptosis-related genes. Therefore, it is possible that knockdown of GAS5 could increase these genes, resulting in the reduced apoptosis in our studies.  Furthermore, splice variants of lncRNA GAS5 function differently depending on if the NB cell line is pre-treatment versus post-treatment, which could serve as a treatment marker for more tailored medical therapy for this difficult to treat tumor.","Basic Science","Cancer Genetics","Oncology"

High Mobility Group Box (HMGB)-1 protein can be rapidly mobilized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to different cellular stresses, such as hypoxia generated in the center of the tumor tissue. The intracellular HMGB1 has been shown to play an essential role in regulating energy homeostasis. Mitochondrial biogenesis, the genetic program by which new mitochondria are synthesized, is integral in maintaining sufficient numbers of mitochondria to adapt to different cellular stresses. However, a mechanistic understanding of how mitochondrial biogenesis contributes to cell growth and tumorigenesis and the role of HMGB1 in the process remain underexplored.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A mouse model of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was generated with wild type and HMGB1-liver-specific knockout mice and the development and progression of HCC was assessed. In vitro, the bioenergetics profiles of HCC cancer cell lines (Hep1-6 and Huh7) were examined with or without HMGB1 silencing using siRNA. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We found that genetic blocking of HMGB1 in hepatocytes decreased susceptibility to DEN-induced HCC carcinogenesis and progression, which was indicated by a decrease in number of tumor nodules and volume, The attenuated HCC was associated with a significant decrease in expression of PPARgamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha  and other markers of mitochondrial biogenesis within the hypoxic tumor in HMGB1-liver-KO mice compared to WT mice. In vitro, silencing HMGB-1 in human and murine HCC cancer cells suspended their ability to proliferate, migrate and invade when subjected to hypoxic conditions. In addition, silencing of HMGB1 resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial biomass, decreased expression of respiratory chain enzymes and decreased rates of oxygen consumption when compared to wild type cancer cell lines. This effect was mediated by HMGB1 activation of cytoplasmic Toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 which subsequently phosphorylates PGC1-alpha to increase the transcription of Transcription Factor A Mitochondrial (TFAM) to induce cancer cell mitochondrial biogenesis and survival in the setting of hypoxia.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results suggest that cancer cell survival and growth in the setting of hypoxia is dependent on a mitochondrial biogenesis pathway in which HMGB1 plays an integral part.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

However, the role of NF?B activation in the tumor microenvironment, i.e. tumor stroma and immune infiltration, on tumor growth has not been extensively studied. We have evaluated the effect of p50 NF?B subunit deletion in the host and tumor microenvironment on pancreatic tumor progression, using our recently validated Syngeneic Tumor Implantation Model (STIM). <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In the STIM model, tumor pieces from KPC mice (Pdx-Cre Kras<sup>G12D</sup><sup>/+</sup> p53<sup>&minus;/&minus;</sup>) are implanted in the pancreas of wild type (WT) or syngeneic gene knock-out mice. We have previously shown that STIM in WT mice has predictable tumor growth, has a robust desmoplastic reaction and intra-tumoral immune infiltration as well as recapitulates the metastatic capabilities of human pancreatic cancer. To specifically evaluate the effect of p50 deletion in the tumor microenvironment (stroma and immune cells) on tumor growth, we implanted KPC tumors (which are p50 replete) in a p50<sup>-/-</sup> background. The growth rate of KPC tumors implanted in WT mice (STIM-WT) and p50<sup>-/-</sup> KO mice (STIM-NFKO) was compared and, their stromal (&alpha;SMA and collagen) and immune components were studied by IHC and flow cytometry. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Significantly lower tumor volumes and tumor weights were observed in the STIM-NFKO mice as compared to STIM-WT mice [4 wks: 60&plusmn;34 vs 1101&plusmn;347 mm<sup>3</sup>, 8 wks: 269&plusmn;74 vs 1958&plusmn;593 mm<sup>3</sup>; p&lt;0.05]. Moreover at 8 weeks post-implantation, 30% of STIM-WT mice (3/10) had metastatic disease [peritoneal metastases (n=3 mice), liver metastases (n=1 mouse)] whereas none of the STIM-NFKO mice had evidence of systemic metastases. Tumors from the STIM-NFKO mice had significantly decreased stromal collagen [38.1 % of STIM-WT, p&lt;0.05] and &alpha;SMA content [normalized to DAPI: 0.07&plusmn;0.02 vs 0.55&plusmn;0.05, STIM-NFKO vs STIM-WT, p&lt;0.05]. On flow cytometry analysis, there were no significant differences among the two groups in terms of intra-tumoral immune cell infiltration (CD4+ T cells, CD8+T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells/MDSCs and macrophages). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Using a novel mouse model of pancreatic cancer, we have demonstrated that the presence of p50 subunit of NF?B in the tumor microenvironment is necessary for tumor growth. Further evaluation of mechanisms by which NF?B in tumor microenvironment impacts tumor growth can elucidate novel chemotherapeutic targets against pancreatic cancer to halt tumor progression and systemic metastasis.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Recombinant thrombomodulin (rTM) is an investigational drug for DIC, which is an anticoagulant for vascular endothelial cells, and thrombin-thrombomodulin complex has an anti-inflammatory effect by producing active protein C. Furthermore, N-terminal domain of rTM inhibits NF-kB activation. Both inflammation and NF-kB activation play a crucial role in cancer progression. NF-kB has been known to be activated in pancreatic cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. We hypothesized that rTM downregulates NF-kB activation and suppresses tumor growth in pancreatic cancer.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We established xenograft orthotopic pancreatic cancer in mice by injection of human pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1). At one week after injection, the animals were treated with i.p. injection of recombinant thrombomodulin 5 times a week or PBS as control for 4 weeks. We compared sequential tumor volume by MRI and conclusive tumor weight and volume. NF-kB activation was evaluated by measuring nuclear localization of p65 protein. To assess adverse effects of rTM, we measured body weight, hemoglobin, and subcutaneous hemorrhagic diathesis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Tumor growth was significantly suppressed by using rTM (p&lt;0.05). rTM significantly inhibited the expression of IKK &beta; (p&lt;0.05) and pIKB&alpha; (p&lt;0.01), and the activation of NF-kB (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, the expression of both cIAP-1 (p&lt;0.01) and cIAP-2 (p&lt;0.01) was suppressed. Immunohistochemical staining revealed down-regulation of VEGF in rTM group. The body weight was significantly higher in rTM group after 4 weeks of treatment (p&lt;0.05). There were no anemia and hemorrhagic diathesis.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: rTM significantly inhibited NF-&kappa;B activation and suppressed tumor growth against human pancreatic cancer without obvious adverse effects.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

C-type Lectin receptors (CLRs), including Dectin-1, are a family of trans-membrane PRRs that are required for recognition of fungal or mycobacterial pathogens. However, while TLR signaling has been implicated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA), the role of Dectin-1 in sterile inflammation, and specifically in the development of PDA, has not been studied. Our work determines the significance of Dectin-1 signaling in pancreatic oncogenesis <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We evaluated the effects of deletion or blockade of dectin-1 signaling in pancreatic cancer on tumor size and survival, peri-tumoral fibro-inflammation, and epithelial transformation. We utilized p48<sup>Cre</sup>;Kras<sup>G12D</sup> (KC) mice as our murine PDA oncogenesis model and we crossed KC mice with Dectin-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice to create a Dectin-1<sup>-/-</sup> pancreatic cancer mouse model.  Components of the dectin-1 signaling pathway and the immune infiltrate within the pancreatic TME were assessed and characterized using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and western blotting in human and murine tissue.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The Dectin-1 receptor and endogenous ligands for the receptor are highly expressed in the inflammatory and epithelial compartments in the pancreatic TME in humans and mice. Dectin-1 deletion or signaling blockade significantly delayed the progression of PDA in mice, while dectin-1 ligation accelerated oncogenesis. Dectin-1 signaling results in the infiltration of pro-tumorigenic tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in the pancreatic TME. Furthermore, Dectin-1 signaling in TAMs directly inhibited the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and induced the differentiation of immune suppressive or regulatory T-cell phenotypes.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In PDA, Dectin-1 receptor ligation induces tumor-permissive inflammatory changes in the pancreatic TME thus contributing to the progression of pancreatic oncogenesis.

Mutational analysis of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors identified frequent loss of DPC4/SMAD4 expression, a known tumor suppressor gene located on the q21 arm of chromosome 18. However, the impact of SMAD4 loss in the pathogenesis of GI-NET is yet to be elucidated.  In this study, we sought to determine the protein expression of SMAD4 in primary GI-NET and the impact on oncologic outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  After appropriate institutional IRB approval, a retrospective analysis inclusive of tissue expression and clinical oncologic outcomes was preformed.  This study included patients who underwent surgical resection for primary locoregional GI-NET, in which tumor tissue and clinical follow-up were available for analysis. Immunohistochemical staining of tumors for SMAD4 expression was independently scored and classified as SMAD4-negative (SMAD4-neg) or SMAD4-positive (SMAD4-pos). Staining results were correlated with clinicopathologic features and oncologic outcomes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 38 GI-NET tumors were available for examination (30 Small bowel, 8 Large Bowel).   Sixteen of the patients were female, 22 were male with a median age of 69 years. Lymph node metastases were common, with 30 patients having lymph node positive disease. Twenty-nine percent of the tumors were SMAD4-neg and 61% SMAD4-pos. No association was observed between SMAD4 and tumor stage. At a median follow-up of 103 months, an overall survival of 155 months was observed. Loss of SMAD4 was associated with a significant difference in disease-free survival and time to recurrence; SMAD4-neg patients experienced a 42 month disease-free survival vs. 185 month (p=0.03; Figure) for SMAD4-pos patients. Importantly, a significantly shorter time to recurrence after surgery was observed in the SMAD-neg patients (28 vs 223 months, p=0.01). A reduction in overall survival, which was not statistically significant was observed (SMAD4-neg: 132 months vs. SMAD4-pos: 184 months; p=0.06). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Consistent with the known biology of the DPC4/SMAD4 gene, the absence of SMAD4 protein expression in the primary gastrointestinal neuorendocrine tumor is negatively associated with cancer-related outcomes after surgical resection.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

We have recently discovered that the SphK1/S1P/S1PR1 axis plays critical roles in inflammation-associated cancer progression, and that the S1PR1 functional antagonist, FTY720, suppresses cancer progression by inhibition of the S1P axis during chronic inflammation. Our hypothesis is that obesity and its related inflammation up-regulate SphK1, which produces more S1P. Elevated levels of S1P in both tumor and its microenvironment stimulate angiogenesis, which results in increased metastasis of breast cancer. Disruption of the S1P axis, which is strengthened by obesity, will reduce cancer metastasis. In this study, we test this hypothesis utilizing two different animal models.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Orthotopically-implanted E0771 syngeneic breast cancer and MMTV-PyMT transgenic breast cancer mouse models were used. Mice were fed with normal or high-fat diet (HFD). FTY720 was administered orally (1 mg/kg/day). Immunofluorescent staining was performed for primary tumor sections to detect blood endothelial cells and macrophages with antibodies for CD31 and F4/80, respectively. Angiogenesis in the primary tumor was determined by measurement of microvessel density. RT-qPCR and western blot were used.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Orthotopic E0771 cell implantation model allow evaluation of identical tumor burden between the treatments, and MMTV-PyMT model allow evaluation of the effect on spontaneous tumor. In both mouse breast cancer models, HFD induced obesity and it significantly worsened the cancer progression. Obesity elevated inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-&alpha; in both circulation and in the tumor. In the tumor, gene expressions of SphK1 and S1PR1, as well as S1P levels are all elevated. FTY720 dramatically reduced the levels of cytokines as well as SphK1, S1PR1 and S1P in both primary and metastatic sites. Further, FTY720 suppressed not only primary tumor growth, but also angiogenesis in the primary tumor with suppression of aggregation of tumor-associated macrophages.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our results indicate an important role of S1P in obesity-related angiogenesis in breast cancer progression. We speculate that S1P may become one of the promising targets for breast cancer patients with obesity.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the systemic and local cytokine profiles in order to determine if the tumor microenvironment changed during disease progression and if these changes were manifested systemically.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Serum and tissue cytokine profiles were assayed among patients with documented adenocarcinoma prior to surgical resection at a single institution from September 2014 to February 2015.  Using the Bio-Plex Pro <sup>TM</sup> Human Th17 Cytokine Assay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories), the concentrations of interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-1&beta;, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-25, IL-31, IL-33, CD40L, interferon-&gamma; (IFN-&gamma;), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&alpha;), were determined. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between TNM staging and cytokine levels.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 33 patients with documented adenocarcinoma were included.  Tumor location was as follows:  left-sided 54% (18/33), right-sided 36% (12/33), and transverse colon 9% (3/33).  AJCC TNM classification was used, with incidence as follows:  stage I-18% (6/33), stage II-27% (9/33), stage III-45% (15/33), and stage IV with metastasis to liver-9% (3/33). Higher tumor stage correlated with elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a, as well as elevated levels of the T-cell polarizing cytokines IL-4 and IL-10.  IFN-g levels were decreased in stage IV samples compared to stage II and III, and IL-17A and IL-17F were elevated, although the latter was not statistically significant.  Furthermore, patients with stage IV disease had elevated serum levels of IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-23.  These cytokines were undetectable in the serum of patients with non-metastatic disease.   <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:These findings suggest that the Th17 pathway has important implications in human colorectal cancer.  Metastatic disease was shown to involve multiple Th17-associated cytokines both in colonic tissue and systemically, as well as a decrease in Th1-associated cytokines.

Identifying stage II/III patients at risk of recurrence and death from metastatic disease has been elusive.  Smad4 loss has been associated with worse outcomes but the underlying mechanism is unknown.  Our prior work showed that Smad4, the central node in the TGF-&beta; superfamily, suppresses Wnt activity by repressing &beta;-catenin via upregulation of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) arm of the pathway.  With the understanding that Smad4 has a direct role in regulating multiple components of the deeply conserved BMP and Wnt pathways, we hypothesized that a Smad4-modulated gene profile would identify high-risk CRC patients. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Gene ontology and bioinformatics tools were used to generate a combined BMP/Wnt target gene list. Transcriptome analysis was done in two independent datasets on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform (discovery set, n=250; validation set, n=566). To develop a Smad4-modulated profile, we correlated the genes in the BMP/Wnt list with Smad4 expression levels. To examine putative Smad4 activity in the profile, we used ExPlain from the Biobase tool to retrieve promoter sequences and determine enrichment of Smad-binding elements (SBEs) for each gene. The Smad4-modulated profile was evaluated by unsupervised hierarchical clustering in the two datasets. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to test association with disease-free survival (DFS). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  We identified 50 target genes common to BMP and Wnt pathways.  Among them, 15 genes were significantly associated with Smad4 expression (Spearman's correlation, p&lt;0.005). Notably, 14 of 15 genes (93%) had palindromic SBEs in their promoter sequences. We examined the Smad4-modulated gene profile in the discovery set and identified distinct patient groups by clustering analysis and noted significant association with DFS. To test this profile, we applied it in the validation set and noted distinct groups by clustering (Figure 1a) as well as significant association with DFS in 461 stage II/III patients (p=0.02, Figure 1b).  In addition, the Smad4-modulated gene profile correlated with lymph node status, hindgut/midgut derivation and enrichment of stem cell signaling (p&lt;0.01).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  A Smad4-modulated target gene profile identified a subset of high-risk CRC patients. Specifically, the Smad4-modulated gene profile identified stage II/III patients who recurred. The profile demonstrated enrichment of SBEs, and this specific subset of molecular variables could be used in both diagnostic and prognostic settings. Future work will focus on the mechanistic implication of Smad4 perturbation on this profile for tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Post-surgical transplant-free survival is impacted mostly by the progression of biliary fibrosis, which is poorly understood. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and portal fibroblasts (PF) produce collagen during liver injury, but PF activation predominates during cholestatic injury. We previously showed that in BA, ductular reactions (DR) or biliary ductular hyperplasia, are associated with the expansion of collagen-producing epithelial-mesenchymal cells expressing the stem/progenitor cell marker PROMININ-1 (PROM1)(Mavila et al, Hepatology 2014). Hypothesis: PROM1+ cells transdifferentiate into DR cells and activated, collagen-producing portal fibroblasts (PF) to promote biliary fibrosis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  6-8 wk old Prom(cre-ert2)-GFP(lsl) were injected intraperitoneally with tamoxifen 10 days prior to injury to induce GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (GFP) expression to fate map all Prom1-expressing cells at the time of tamoxifen exposure. Cholestatic (Bile duct ligation (BDL)) or hepatotoxic (carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)) injuries were induced. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed to evaluate gene expression of Prom1 and activated PF genes (aSma, NTPDase, Elastin) early (&lt;2 wks) and late (&gt;5 wks). Immunofluorescence (IF) was performed to quantify co-expression of GFP with either biliary (CK19) or PF markers. An Affymetrix gene array analysis was performed on FACS-isolated, Collagen-producing hepatic stellate cells (GFP+VitA+) and portal fibroblasts (GFP+VitA-GMP6A-) from Collagen 1a-GFP mice, 3 wks post-BDL.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Prom1 expression (normalized to sham) were higher at 2 wks and 5wks post-BDL, than those of CCl4 (2 wks: 3.10.7 vs 0.60.1, n=6, p&lt;0.05; 5 wks: 9.32.3 vs 1.30.1, n=6, p&lt;0.05). Relative levels of activated PF gene expression increased significantly 5 wks post-BDL (Ntpdase2: 10.62.4, HNF1v: 26.33.3, Elastin: 8.22.5, n=3, p&lt;0.05) and were significantly greater than those of CCl4 (NTPDase: 0.50.2, HNF1v: 1.80.6, Elastin: 3.50.7, n=3, p&lt;0.05). Lineage tracing of PROM1-expressing cells by IF demonstrated rare GFP+ cells in periportal regions of sham livers. At 2 wks post-BDL, GFP+ cell expansion was noted within CK19+ DRs, and at 5 wks, most CK19+ cells were also GFP+, indicating that DR cells derive from PROM1+ cells. Rare periportal GFP+aSMA+ and GFP+NTPDase2+ cells were observed. However, FACS-isolated activated PFs (post-BDL) exhibited 23-fold higher Prom1 expression than non-activated PFs and 12-fold higher Prom1 expression than activated HSC.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The expansion of the PROM1+ cell population is a biliary injury specific phenomenon.

Brigstock<sup>1,2</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Nationwide Children's Hospital,Pediatric Surgery,Columbus, OH, USA <sup>2</sup>Ohio State University,Pediatric Surgery,Columbus, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  A key event in chronic liver injury is the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) which causes these normally quiescent cells to become proliferative, to express alpha-smooth muscle actin (&alpha;SMA), and to perpetually synthesize fibrogenic mediators such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), resulting in unrelentingly deposition of collagen which causes fibrosis and ultimately compromises liver function. The goal of this work was to establish if pathways of HSC fibrogenesis are regulated by hepatocyte-derived exosomes. Exosomes (which arise by inward budding of the limiting membrane of multivesicular bodies (MVB)) are membranous nanovesicles which function as intercellular molecular shuttles for delivering their complex payload (microRNA, mRNA protein) to other cells.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Exosomes that had been isolated from cultures of primary mouse hepatocytes or AML12 mouse hepatocytes were stained with PKH26 fluorescent dye and incubated with primary mouse HSC for up to 48 hrs after which HSC-associated fluorescence was evaluated. GFP-transfected hepatocytes, treated with or without the exosome inhibitor GW4869, were co-cultured with HSC in which GFP uptake was assessed. mRNA encoding exosome biogenic components was evaluated by RT-PCR in hepatocytes after exposure of the cells to 0-50mM ethanol. Expression of &alpha;SMA or CTGF in HSC was evaluated by RT-PCR following their 48-hr treatment with exosomes from control AML12 hepatocytes, or from AML12 cells that had been treated with 50mM ethanol for 48hr, or 30ng/ml TNF&alpha; for the last 24hrs or ethanol for 48hrs and TNF&alpha; for the last 24hrs.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Expression of nSMase2 (required for biosynthesis of ceramide on which exosome production depends), Rab5b/c (regulates biogenesis of precursors of MVB), and/or Rab27a/c (promotes fusion of exosome-laden MVBs with the plasma membrane) was dose-dependently stimulated in hepatocytes by ethanol. PKH26-stained hepatocyte-derived exosomes were taken up by HSC. GW4869-mediated inhibition of nSMase2 in GFP-transfected AML12 cells caused reduced delivery of exosomal GFP to recipient HSC without affecting donor cell GFP expression. Fibrogenic activity or activation in HSC was not stimulated by exosomes from healthy hepatocytes whereas exosomes from ethanol-sensitized hepatocytes exposed to TNF&alpha; stimulated &alpha;SMA or CTGF expression, an effect that was more pronounced as compared to the response to exosomes from hepatocytes exposed to each stimulant alone.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Exosomes from hepatocytes are able to bind to HSC with the result that, if the exosomes are from injured hepatocytes, they can stimulate HSC activation and fibrogenesis. These results identify exosomes as molecular shuttles which can transmit pro-fibrogenic molecular cues from injured hepatocytes to HSC. This identifies a novel mechanism of hepatocyte-HSC cross-talk and provides a new lead for developing novel strategies for liver fibrosis therapy.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

Liver transplantation is associated with multiple complications including those resulting from immunosuppression. Consequently, opportunity for drastic improvement in the current standard of care exists and tissue-engineered liver carries potential to meet this need. Our lab has successfully engineered human intestine and therefore we hypothesized that with a similar technique, functional tissue-engineered liver (TELi) would grow from post-natal human liver progenitors. Liver failure often progresses slowly and cryopreservation prior to advanced hepatic fibrosis could provide the patient's own tissue for subsequent liver regeneration. Our lab noted previous success with vitrification for intestine and we hypothesized it would also successfully cryopreserve human liver tissue prior to generation of TELi.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Human liver tissue was obtained from pediatric surgical specimens and prepared similar to our previously published protocol for generating intestinal organoid units. The majority of the organoid units underwent vitrification and storage in liquid nitrogen according to the published protocol prior to generation of TELi. The liver organoid units were loaded onto biodegradable scaffolds and implanted subcutaneously into NSG mice. Control mice received a sham operation of subcutaneous dissection or polymer implant lacking human liver organoid units. Four weeks later the mice were treated with debrisoquine, primarily metabolized by the human enzyme CYP2D6 into 4-OH-debrisoquine prior to serum harvest. The implants were sectioned for H&amp;E staining. Serum from the mice (n=16) hosting human TELi and sham (n=6) was subjected to ELISA detection of human albumin. The serum of control (n=10) and hTELi (n=16) mice harvested between 1 and 4 hours post-gavage underwent liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to obtain ratios of parent drug to metabolite.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Both TELi generated after cryopreservation and native liver demonstrated presence of hepatocytes on H&amp;E staining. The human albumin concentration was detectable in the mice hosting human TELi and rose significantly with increasing number of implants per mouse (Figure). The serum harvested at 1 and 2 hours after debrisoquine gavage showed no significant metabolite difference between TELi and sham. However, at 4 hours post-gavage the mice with human TELi had significantly increased levels of the human metabolite 4-OH-debrisoquine compared to sham.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Human TELi derived from post-natal liver tissue is capable of synthesizing albumin in-vivo and the hepatocytes in human TELi appear to possess metabolic function. Also, vitrification of human liver tissue allows generation of human TELi after cryopreservation.

Creating patient-specific replacement organs promises to address these issues. However, traditional approaches to tissue engineering using sell-seeded scaffolds ultimately rely on diffusion and vascular ingrowth from the wound bed, which are insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of hepatic tissue. Synthesizing and integrating a vascular system de novo requires precise orchestration of progenitor cells and regulatory cues that are not currently well understood. Here, we describe a novel approach to fabricate vascularized neo-livers by repurposing expendable microvascular beds (EMBs) found within autologous free flaps. The intact, patterned circulatory beds allow immediate perfusion of the neo-livers after surgical vascular anastomosis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells in vitro. Superficial inferior epigastric (SIE) flaps from male Wistar rats (n=3) were raised and detached at the vascular pedicle. The vascular beds were seeded with adipose derived stem cells (ASCs), hepatocytes, and endothelial cells through intra-vascular perfusion. Following a dwell period to allow cellular egress and engraftment into the perivascular parenchyma, the nascent neo-liver construct was re-implanted with vascular anastomoses to the femoral vessels. Simultaneous partial hepatectomy provided a systemic stimulus for hepatic proliferation within the neo-livers. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: ASCs, when co-cultured with hepatocytes, drive spontaneous auto-assembly into functional liver buds. Bioluminescence imaging, confocal microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry confirm efficient cell seeding and hepatic tissue formation within the vascularized constructs in vivo. Co-delivery of ASCs and hepatocytes recapitulates the hepatic developmental environment and contributes to improved bulk engraftment and facilitates auto-assembly into hepatic tissue resembling native liver in both form and function. Neo-liver exhibits a sinusoidal appearance similar to native liver. Immunofluorescence demonstrates production of liver-specific proteins including albumin, cytochrome P450, and alpha-1-antitrypsin.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have developed a strategy for engineering autologous, vascularized hepatic tissue. Repurposing native circulatory beds is a viable platform for integrating an intact circulatory system into engineered tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells provide a renewable source of hepatocytes and also serve in a supportive role, recapitulating key developmental interactions that facilitate auto-assembly into functional liver. This tissue can be implanted in bulk and perfused by standard vascular anastomosis, representing a major leap forward in tissue-engineered organ replacement therapy.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

This is particularly true in the case of fat grafting, where resorption rates have been reported to vary from 10-90%. In this study, we have investigated the potential of a subpopulation of adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) positive for bone morphogenetic protein receptor IA (BMPRIA) for de novo adipogenesis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Human lipoaspirate was enzymatically digested in order to obtain stromal vascular fraction (SVF), the cell population containing ASCs.

Cells from each group were cultured in adipogenic differentiation medium for 7 days. In vitro adipogenic differentiation experiments were repeated in the presence of matrigel. Oil-Red-O staining and quantification was performed for all groups, as was qRT-PCR for adipogenic gene expression. Cells from each group were labeled with a GFP lentivirus and subsequently transplanted into the inguinal fat pads of immunocompromised mice for evaluation of de novo adipogenesis. In order to assess the translatability of these studies, transplant experiments were performed using phosphate buffered saline, collagen gel, and matrigel as cell delivery vehicles.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Proliferation, gene analysis, and histological staining assays were performed, showing differences between BMPR-1A+, BMPR-1A- and unsorted cell populations. Oil-Red-O staining and quantification showed more lipid droplet formation in BMPR-IA+ cells (*p&lt;0.05). BMPR-IA+ cells additionally showed significantly increased expression of FABP4 (*p&lt;0.05), a marker of terminal adipocytic differentiation.

We are interested in discovering novel strategies to enhance the wound healing process in diabetic patients.  We have previously shown that inhibiting Notch inhibits wound healing. Based upon our previous work, we propose that upregulation of Notch would increase rates of wound healing.  JAG1 is a known activator of Notch. Therefore, we hypothesized that applying topical JAG1 to stented excisional wounds on the backs of diabetic and wild-type mice would result in increased Notch activity, and thus an increased wound healing rate as compared to untreated wounds.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 8-week old, healthy male diabetic mice (db/db, n=44), or heterozygous mice exhibiting wild-type phenotype (WT/db, n=44) were anesthetized &amp; after depilation, two 1cm<sup>2</sup> full-thickness wounds were placed on their backs extending through the panniculus carnosus. A 12 mm diameter silicone stent was secured around each wound with cyanoacrylate glue &amp; interrupted 5-0 nylon suture to prevent healing by contraction. Wounds were dressed with sterile N-terface &amp; Tegaderm, then the mice were wrapped with Coban, which was secured with Transpore tape. Dressings were changed every day after topical application onto the open wound bed of JAG1 (10 nM) or vehicle (PBS) for 14 days. Digital photographs were taken at every dressing change. At the end of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed &amp; wounds were harvested for histological and protein analysis. Wounds were analyzed using ImageJ software &amp; expressed as a ratio of wound area to stent area, with scaling normalized to the inner circumference of the splint as a standard. Wound area was calculated as a percent area of the original wound size. Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05 using the students' t-test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Partial to complete re-epithelialization was seen in the wounded tissues over the experimental period in both the control &amp; JAG1 treated groups. Both diabetic and wild-type mice treated with topical JAG1 had an increased rate of wound closure when compared to wounds treated with PBS.  As expected, the control wounds on diabetic mice demonstrated a slower rate of healing than control wounds on wild-type mice. No significant local side effects such as increased edema or allergic reaction were noted in the JAG1-treated mice. <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:JAG1 increases the rate of re-epithelialization of cutaneous wounds in the in vivo diabetic murine stented wound-healing model, indicating that Notch signaling plays a crucial role in wound healing in mice. Based upon our findings, further study of Notch in diabetic wound healing should be conducted which may then lead to better therapeutics for the wound healing process in patients.","Basic Science","Wound Healing/Fibrosis","Plastics"

Fgf receptor (Fgfr) expression has been induced during intestinal adaptation following massive bowel resection. The components of this pathway are conserved between humans and zebrafish. The role of Fgf signaling in the adult zebrafish short bowel syndrome (SBS) model is not yet defined. We hypothesized that inhibition of Fgf signaling would impair intestinal adaptation in the zebrafish SBS model.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  With IACUC approval, SBS was generated in adult male hsp70:dnfgfr1-GFP zebrafish. These were compared to sham operation zebrafish that underwent laparotomy alone. Heatshock was performed on sham and SBS zebrafish daily for 2 weeks (HS SBS n=5, HS sham n=4) to reduce fgfr expression. These groups were compared to non-heatshock treated transgenic zebrafish (NHS SBS n=5, NHS sham n=4). Zebrafish weights were obtained at the time of surgery and weekly before sacrifice. Proximal intestine was harvested at 2 weeks. H&amp;E and Alcian blue staining was performed. Immunofluorescence was performed for BrdU and TUNEL. RT-qPCR was performed for fgfr1. Villus epithelial perimeter (VEP) was measured and percentages of BrdU(+), Alcian blue(+) and TUNEL(+) cells per hemivillus were calculated by a blinded, trained observer with ImageJ.

HS SBS VEP was significantly shorter than NHS SBS (385.4&plusmn;44.5&mu;m v. 627.0&plusmn;20.1&mu;m, p=0.003). NHS SBS displayed a 2.5-fold increase in BrdU(+) cells per hemivillus compared to NHS sham(p=0.02) and HS SBS displayed a 3.9-fold increase in BrdU(+) cells per hemivillus compared to HS sham (p=0.02).

Greig<sup>1</sup>, R. A. Cowles<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine,New Haven, CT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The small intestine has the ability to recover from injury in large part due to the presence of enterocyte precursors that rapidly divide and repopulate the mucosal surface of the bowel. Enteric neurons, in contrast, are considered terminally differentiated and are not felt to have the ability to give rise to new components of the enteric nervous system (ENS) after injury. Since the ENS resides in close proximity to the noxious contents of the intestinal lumen and since the intestine appears to recover from many types of injury, some process for repair of the injured ENS must exist. We hypothesized that moderate intestinal injury via ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) would have effects on the intestinal mucosa and that the ENS would generate new neurons in response to injury. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In order to identify newly generated enteric neurons, Nestin CreER/EGFP bitrasngenic mice were generated from the two separate transgenic strains. Mice were given a daily intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen for four consecutive days to induce expression of GFP in nestin-postitive neural progenitor cells and their progeny. Intestinal ischemia was induced by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 45 minutes followed by release of the clamp and abdominal wall closure. Mice were sacrificed at varying time points after I/R injury. The ileum was harvested, washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in sucrose or prepared for standard histology. Whole mounts of the myenteric plexus were generated by manually peeling away the overlying layers and these were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Double immunofluorescence was performed using anti-GFP and anti-Hu antibodies to identify GFP-positive cells and mature neurons respectively. Tiled images of the myenteric plexus were obtained using a confocal microscope. The number of GFP- and Hu-positive cells were counted and the percentage of GFP-positive cells was calculated. The study protocol was approved by the IACUC. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Intestinal I/R caused mucosal injury that appeared to peak at 24 hours post-injury. Mucosal architecture returned to normal between 7 and 14 days after I/R and we therefore chose to study the generation of new enteric neurons at the 7 day time point. At baseline, in either unoperated controls or in mice undergoing a sham laparotomy, the percentage of differentiated (Hu-positive) neurons that appeared to be newly generated (GFP-positive) was small (0.52-0.58%) but not zero. This percentage of newly generated neurons increased 6-fold (to 3%) in mice subjected to 45 minutes of intestinal ischemia. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The ENS has the capacity to replace injured neurons both at baseline and in conditions of stress. Intestinal I/R injury results in changes in the mucosal and ENS layers of the bowel with significantly increased numbers of newly generated neurons in the myenteric plexus.  The stimuli responsible for generation of new myenteric neurons remains unknown.","Basic Science","Developmental Biology/Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering","Pediatrics"

Besner<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Nationwide Children's Hospital,Department Of Pediatric Surgery,Columbus, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a clinical condition with few solutions. Tissue engineered intestine (TEI) is a potential solution to SBS, but many models require amounts of donor intestine often exceeding the amount of remaining intestine an SBS patient can provide, limiting the feasibility of this approach. Advances in intestinal epithelial culture demonstrate that intestinal crypts can produce epithelial surrogates known as enteroids that can be passaged for months and may serve as a viable tissue source for the production of TEI.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We first established a reproducible enteroid seeding technique for the production of TEI. Crypts were harvested from full lengths of LGR5-EGFP mouse intestine and cultured to produce enteroids. After 11-14 days, enteroids were seeded onto polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffolds in either Matrigel or cell culture medium, and implanted into the peritoneal cavity of NOD/SCID mice for 4 weeks. Tissue architecture and epithelial components were analyzed using Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. The total length of neomucosa was quantified using ImageJ software. We next determined whether enteroid cultures could be established from an intestinal biopsy, expanded ex vivo, and used to produce TEI. Six 2 x 2 mm pieces of jejunum were harvested from LGR5-EGFP transgenic mice and processed separately to establish enteroid cultures. Fourteen days later, enteroids were passaged for expansion. Light microscopy was used to quantify enteroids. After 21 days, expanded enteroids were seeded onto PGA scaffolds and implanted into NOD/SCID mice for 4 weeks.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Enteroids seeded in Matrigel produced TEI in 11/11 (100%) scaffolds whereas enteroids seeded in medium produced TEI in only 3/6 (50%) scaffolds. Seeding in Matrigel produced significantly more neomucosa compared to seeding in media (18,966 &mu;m vs. 324 &mu;m; p=0.038). Histologic examination of TEI demonstrated crypt domains and overlying epithelium with blunted villi. The presence of goblet cells, Paneth cells, enterochromaffin cells, and intestinal stem cells in the neomucosa was confirmed by a combination of PAS and immunofluorescent staining of histologic tissue sections. Crypts were successfully obtained from biopsies with an average of 103 &plusmn; 24 enteroids produced from each biopsy. A single passage produced an average of 620 &plusmn; 90 enteroids, which was enough for scaffold seeding. TEI was produced in 5/6 (83%) scaffolds seeded with enteroids that had been expanded ex vivo.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Enteroids grown ex vivo can be successfully seeded onto scaffolds and implanted in vivo to grow TEI. Moreover, enteroids can be obtained from minimal starting material and expanded to produce TEI.

NEC makes up approximately 5% of all neonatal intensive care unit admissions.  Despite years of investigation, the pathophysiology remains unknown.  Cronobacter sakazakii (CS) is a bacteria that has been implicated in outbreaks of infant NEC. Tight junctions (TJ) are protein complexes in the most apical portion of the intestinal villi. These proteins are important in both intercellular pore formation and maintaining a protective intestinal barrier. We hypothesize that in an experimental model of CS-induced NEC, there are alterations in TJ protein location and expression.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Rat pups were subjected to hypoxia twice a day and fed either clean formula (control group) or CS formula (NEC group).

The Slit3 knockout (KO) mouse model for CDH has PAH, and the PAH evolves over time. We have shown that systolic and right ventricle (RV) mean pressures are similar in wild-type (WT) and KO 2 week old mice, but there is a significant difference in WT and KO mice at 4 weeks, with increased pressures in KO mice. With the use of mouse echocardiograms, we aim to determine the timeline of the development of PAH and RV remodeling in the Slit3 mouse model for CDH.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Slit3 WT and KO mice were analyzed at 2 weeks (WT n=4, KO n=7), 4 weeks (WT n=5, KO n=4) and 2-3 months (adult) of age (WT n=8, KO n=6). Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane. Echocardiography was performed to analyze RV wall thickness, internal diameter (ID), and function. Color Doppler was used to analyze flow in the PA and across the tricuspid valve. RV pressures were obtained by direct cardiac puncture. The RV of each mouse was harvested. RNA was extracted and purified using RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using a probe and primer targeting the mouse Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene (Roche).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Echocardiography revealed statistically significant differences between KO and WT mice with an elevation in PA peak velocities at 4 weeks (1015.14mm/s vs. 654.59mm/s (p&lt;0.05)) and in adulthood, decreased pulmonary acceleration times in adulthood (p&lt;0.05), and increased pulmonary vascular resistance at 2 weeks (12.21mm<sup>2</sup>/s vs. 5.69 mm<sup>2</sup>/s (p&lt;0.05)) and in adulthood (p&lt;0.05). Several parameters, including RV dilation, PA velocity time indices, and pulmonary vascular resistance, were increased at 4 weeks in the KO mice, but failed to reach statistical significance. Excluding parameters stated above, no significant differences were found at 2 weeks between KO and WT mice. Consistent with RV remodeling, RV-BNP gene expression increased over time in the KO in comparison to WT mice (Fold change KO vs. WT: 2 weeks- 1.32, 4 weeks- 6.18, adult- 8.19). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Slit3 KO mice have echocardiographic changes and increased RV-BNP gene expression consistent with PAH. The progressive changes in the data over the time series is consistent with the increasing severity of PAH that occurs due to pulmonary arterial vascular remodeling, which leads to changes in RV and pulmonary artery morphology and hemodynamic function. Intervention prior to the period of pulmonary vascular and right ventricular remodeling may provide a time window for treating PAH associated with CDH. Further elucidation of the timing of pulmonary vascular remodeling will provide a greater understanding of the evolution of PAH in CDH.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

Despite re-establishment of biliary drainage by portoenterostomy, many infants develop fibrosis requiring liver transplant. The mechanisms by which fibrosis occurs remain unknown. In the murine model of BA, Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) infection of newborn pups results in a cholangiopathy paralleling human BA and is used to study mechanistic aspects of the disease. Infected mice however, experience a high mortality by DOL14. The aim of this study was to develop a model of a virus-induced biliary obstruction that allows survival beyond two weeks to determine if fibrosis occurs.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus composed of eleven genes encoding 6 structural proteins (VP1-VP4, VP6 and VP7) and 6 nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP6). When two rotavirus strains simultaneously infect a host cell, the resulting progeny contain different combinations of the parental strain's genome and are called reassortants. To better understand the RRV genes involved in the pathogenesis of BA, single and double gene reassortants were created by co-culture of RRV and TUCH (T), a simian rotavirus strain that does not cause the model. In the progeny, T<sup>R2</sup> and T<sup>R4</sup> are composed of ten genes from the TUCH parent with the VP2 or VP4 gene respectively, from RRV. T<sup>R2,4</sup> contains both VP2 and VP4 RRV genes with the remaining nine genes from the TUCH parent. The VP4 gene was utilized due to its vital role in cholangiocyte tropism. T<sup>R2,4 </sup>was used due to its ability to replicate at a lower titer than RRV.We have previously shown 80% mortality by DOL14 with RRV injected on DOL0-3. Thus, in our new model, newborn pups underwent intraperitoneal inoculation of the viruses on DOL4 in an effort to improve survival. Mice were monitored for biliary obstructive symptomatology. At DOL28, bile ducts and livers were harvested and evaluated by an independent pathologist using the Ishak fibrosis scoring system. Analysis was performed using the Chi-square test. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Mice were inoculated with RRV (n=100), T<sup>R2</sup> (n=50), T<sup>R4</sup> (n=65) or T<sup>R2, 4 </sup>(n=100).

Ninety-four percent of T<sup>R4</sup> mice exhibited obstructive symptoms on DOL11, with minimal mortality (6% by DOL28).

The etiology of BA still remains unclear but a current hypothesis suggests a perinatal viral infection triggers the host's inflammatory immune response. Previously we identified the VP4 gene on Rhesus Rotavirus (RRV) as the major determinant for the induction of the murine model of BA. Using a non-pathogenic strain, Ro1845, we generated a reassortant (Ro1845 <sup>R(VP4)</sup>) with 10 genes from the parent strain and one gene, VP4, from RRV.  We demonstrated that Ro1845 <sup>R(VP4)</sup> is able to infect and replicate in cholangiocytes similar to that of RRV, as well as induce the BA model. Using Ro1845 <sup>R(VP4)</sup> we also showed that RRV's VP4 plays a role in NK cell activation. A previous study found that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) activate NK cells in the murine model of BA. We hypothesized that RRV's VP4 plays an important role in activation of pDCs which subsequently activate the NK cells.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  BALB/c mice were injected within the first 24 hours of life with saline, RRV, Ro1845, or Ro1845 <sup>R(VP4)</sup>. Livers and bile ducts were harvested on post-infection (PI) day 7 or 10. Miltenyi column purification kits were used to isolate pDCs, CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, and NK cells from the harvested livers. Viral titers and flow cytometry were performed on the immune cell populations. In order to isolate a larger quantity of pDCs, adult BALB/c mice were injected with B16 Flt-3 ligand, which causes expansion of the dendritic cell population.  Naive pDCs were isolated from B16 Flt-3 ligand injected mice and used for RRV infection.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The purified NK cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells harvested from the livers on PI day 7 were found to have all three viral strains present. However, virus was only detected in the pDCs isolated from RRV and Ro1845 <sup>R(VP4)</sup>  infected mice (1.6&plusmn;0.1 x 10<sup>3</sup>, 2.4&plusmn;1.0 x 10<sup>3</sup> respectively) but not in Ro1845 infected mice.  At day 10 PI, virus persisted in both the NK cells, and pDCs, of RRV and Ro1845 <sup>R(VP4) </sup>infected mice but was not detectable in Ro1845 infected immune cells. Flow cytometry demonstrated a significant increase in the activation of pDCs isolated from RRV (39.9%) and Ro1845 <sup>R(VP4)</sup> ( 42.4%) infected mice compared to Ro1845 infected mice (27.8%, p&lt;0.05).  Viral titers measured in na&iuml;ve pDCs infected with RRV in-vitro demonstrated the evidence of virus replication in pDCs (9.3&plusmn;1.8 x 10<sup>5</sup>).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: RRV VP4 plays an important role in the activation of pDCs and NK cells. Measurement of viral yield demonstrated that non-disease inducing strains (Ro1845) were capable of infecting CD8+ and NK cells but only those strains expressing the RRV VP4 have the potential to infect the pDCs. These findings further define the pathogenesis of biliary atresia and may have implications for future therapies to block the progression of the disease.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

Post-surgical transplant-free survival is impacted mostly by the progression of biliary fibrosis, which is poorly understood. We recently demonstrated the expansion of collagen-producing cells expressing the stem cell marker PROMININ-1 (PROM1) within regions of evolving biliary fibrosis in both human and the murine model of BA induced by Rhesus rotavirus (RRV)(Mavila et al, Hepatology 2014). Thus, we hypothesized that PROM1 functionally promotes the biliary fibrosis seen in BA.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Prom1-cre transgenic BALB/c mice, in which a Cre recombinase transgene was knocked in to the Prominin-1 gene locus, were bred. Thus, Prom1-cre<sup>+/+</sup> = Prom1 knockouts (KO), Prom1-cre<sup>-/-</sup> = Prom1 wildtype (WT), and Prom1-cre<sup>+/-</sup> = Prom1 heterozygous (HET). Newborn pups were inoculated intraperitoneally (1.5x10<sup>6</sup> colony forming units RRV or saline) within the 1st day of life to induce experimental BA (jaundice, acholic stool, obliterated extrahepatic bile ducts). 2 wks later, serum and liver were analyzed for bilirubin level, gene expression (qPCR, immunofluorescence) and collagen staining. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used for statistical analyses where appropriate.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A robust increase in PROM1+ periportal cells within developing biliary fibrosis after RRV treatment was observed in Prom1 WT and HET mice by immunofluorescence. No PROM1+ cells were observed in KO mice. qPCR showed significantly less Prom1 expression in KO and HET livers compared to WT (0.13&plusmn;0.1 vs 1.1&plusmn;0.9 vs 21.6&plusmn;2.4, p&lt;0.0001). KO livers exhibited significantly less expression of the mesenchymal gene Vimentin (0.31&plusmn;0.1 vs 1.0&plusmn;0.2, p=0.03) and a trend toward less expression of the biliary gene Ck19 (0.48&plusmn;0.2 vs 0.94&plusmn;0.2, p=0.12) compared to WT/HET, consistent with decreased biliary fibrogenesis. In terms of fibrosis, RRV-treated Prom1 WT and HET mice exhibited significantly greater collagen deposition by Sirius red staining compared to their respective saline controls (WT: 5.2&plusmn;0.03 vs 2.2&plusmn;0.1 Collagen Proportionate Area [CPA], n=9, p=0.0002; HET: 5.1&plusmn;0.3 vs 2.9&plusmn;0.8 CPA, n=10, p=0.02). No difference was observed between RRV-treated KO vs control (3.6&plusmn;0.2 vs 3.5&plusmn;0.1 CPA, respectively n=11, p=NS). Most notably, WT and HET displayed significantly greater fibrosis than KO (p&lt;0.0001).

Hepatic steatosis is a major component of IFALD and has been shown to persist in patients even after weaning off TPN. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hepatic steatosis occurs in our murine model of massive small bowel resection (SBR). We next sought to determine whether the observed accelerated hepatic steatosis after SBR was affected by manipulation of the intestinal microbiome.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Male C57/Bl6 mice (n=4 per group) underwent 50% proximal (SBR) and followed by orogastric gavage with Vancomycin (2mg/kg) or vehicle every 3 days. Food consumption was measured daily for 1 month. Body composition was recorded by magnetic resonance weekly. The animals were sacrificed at 10 weeks. Liver sections were stained with H&amp;E and analyzed using NIS Elements V4.3 software to obtain the percent lipid content using 4 random fields at 4x magnification per sample. Fecal samples were collected prior to resection and at 3 weeks post resection then processed with a QIAGEN stool DNA isolation kit. Sample quality was confirmed with an Agilent Bioanalyzer chip. Amplicons were generated for all 9 ribosomal hyper-variable regions of bacterial 16s rRNA and sequence analysis done using QIME, UCLUST, the Ribosomal Database Project and the GreenGene database. Operational taxonomic units consisting of more than 1% of the total reads was considered a relevant microbial constituent.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Compared with unoperated mice, SBR was associated with a marked (greater than 50-fold) increase in hepatic steatosis compared to non-operated mice (6.28% vs. 0.12%, p&lt;0.05). Oral vancomycin resulted in a 15-fold reduction in hepatic lipid content (6.26% vs. 0.4%, p&lt;0.05) after SBR (Figure 1). There was no difference in total body composition, weight, or food consumption. SBR resulted in significant changes in 4 major constituents of the gut microbiome. Oral vancomycin resulted in further significant changes with the major driver being a 55% increase in a member of the Escherichia/Shigella genera.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have shown for the first time that massive SBR is associated with the development of hepatic steatosis in our murine model, a phenotype that is prevented by oral vancomycin.

These include a loss of epithelial barrier function (EBF) allowing for translocation of enteric bacteria outside of bowel lumen, resulting in infectious complications. We have demonstrated this in a mouse TPN model. As studies in human tissue are less defined, we took the novel approach of examining the interaction of dominant bacterial strains from TPN mice in human intestinal organoids (HIO). HIOs are generated through directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells; the result is a 3-D differentiated human intestinal tissue capable of modeling the pathogenesis of enteric disease. We hypothesized TPN derived bacteria microinjection in HIOs would result in similar translocation patterns to that seen in our mouse model.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  WT C57/BI6 mice were randomized to standard Chow or TPN. Mice were euthanized after 7-days and samples of effluent, bowel mucosa, liver and spleen were harvested in sterile conditions. We then isolated bacterial strains from TPN mice, microinjected them into the HIO lumen, and co-cultured for 48h.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We examined strains of bacteria which translocated&mdash;this was only seen in TPN mice. They were: E. faecalis (10<sup>3</sup> CFU/g liver; 10<sup>6 </sup>CFU/g spleen) and E. faecium (10<sup>6 </sup>CFU/g liver; 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/g spleen); commensal Firmicutes implicated in TPN-associated sepsis. HIOs were assessed for evidence of morphologic changes, bacterial translocation and bacterial luminal growth . Bacterial isolates derived from TPN mice (vs. sterile media) led to a dramatic change in mucosal maturation, including increase in thickness (2.4-3.4x increased, Fig 1), as well as development of crypts and villi. Isolates varied in their ability to persist within the HIO lumen. Klebsiella variicola and Enterobacter asburiae failed to persist over a 48h co-culture, while viable Enterococcus faecalis was cultured from the HIO lumen. Both K. variicola and E. asburiae translocated across the HIO epithelial barrier and were detected in the external culture media while E. faecalis was not found externally. Mucous production was studied via Alcian blue staining.  K. variicola and E. asburiae, the isolates which translocated, led to increased mucous production within the organoid.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: In a mouse model, TPN led to bacterial translocation. Translocation of bacteria across the HIO did not fully correlate with the TPN model yet it was associated with altered mucus expression, suggesting that microbial mucus induction may play a key role in modulating translocation across the epithelial barrier.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

Modeling neonatal sepsis remains a challenge. A recently described murine model of cecal slurry has offered exciting promise in mimicking neonatal sepsis. Further, with respect to sepsis induced immune pathways alterations, our laboratory has noted a key role for a family of co-inhibitory molecules in adult septic mice and ICU patients, which may be a target for development of novel therapies. We examine the role of one co-inhibitory molecule, programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) in an evolving model of neonatal sepsis.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Our cecal slurry model consists of harvesting the cecal contents of an adult wild type (Wt) mouse and combining it with 5% dextrose to create a slurry with a concentration of 80mg/ml (LD<sub>70</sub> at 7 days). Neonatal mice (5-7 days of age) from both C57BL/6 Wild type and PD-1 knockout underwent intraperitoneal injection (IP) of the cecal slurry (CS) versus IP of 0.9% saline for sham procedure (Sh). Western blot and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess for differential expression of PD-1. Cytometric bead array was utilized to identify changes in circulating cytokine expression. H&amp;E was used for tissue morphology of liver, lung and cardiac tissue. Survival studies following CS and Sh in Wt and PD-1 knockout were performed and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Presence of intra-abdominal sepsis was confirmed by bacterial count of peritoneal lavage (PL) at 24 hours. PL of CS mice had 7.89 x 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/microliter vs 0 CFU/microliter in the Sh pups (p&lt;0.05).  Histologic assessment of organ specimens demonstrated alterations in tissue architecture and cell response most notable in lung, liver and thymus.  Liver and thymus specimens of Wt CS mice showed apoptosis that was not present in the Wt Sh group. However, PD-1 knockout mice undergoing CS demonstrated decreased apoptosis compared to Wt. Septal thickening was present in lung specimen of Wt CS pups, which was again attenuated in CS PD-1 knockout mice. Wt CS mice had significantly decreased survival when compared to Sh, however, PD-1 mice undergoing CS had improved survival when compared to their Wt counterparts. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We demonstrate with a novel model of neonatal sepsis, that the checkpoint protein, PD-1, plays an important role in the development in morbidity and mortality following sepsis. Given that these molecules are altered in the neonatal and adult murine models of sepsis and are elevated in critically ill septic patients, this implies that PD-1 may be a promising potential target for improving outcomes in sepsis.","Basic Science","Disease Pathogenesis","Pediatrics"

A breakdown in intestinal integrity contributes to the severity of this disease. Providing breast milk to premature infants can reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Milk fat globule&ndash;EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) is a secretory glycoprotein and is abundant in mammalian breast milk. MFG-E8 has anti-inflammatory activity and plays a major role in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial homeostasis. Thus, we hypothesize that MFG-E8 will reduce mortality in neonatal sepsis by protecting their intestinal integrity.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Newborn wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and MFG-E8 knockout (KO) mice stayed with their mothers throughout the experiments.  At age 5-7 days (3-4 g), the neonatal mice were made septic by intraperitoneal injection of cecal slurry (CS; 0.75 mg CS/g body weight) and monitored for a 7-day survival study. The CS was prepared from a mixture of cecal contents from 7 adult male WT mice (8-10 weeks old).  To study intestinal injury, the neonatal mice were injected with 0.9 mg CS/g body weight (n=6-8 per group). At 10 h after injection, the small intestine was collected for analysis by ELISA, Western blot, myeloperoxidase activity, and endotoxin assay.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The 7-day survival of septic WT neonates was 73%, while all the septic MFG-E8 KO neonates died within 2 days (Figure, P &lt; 0.001).

The myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration, in the intestine of septic MFG-E8 KO neonates was 3.8&ndash;fold higher than that in septic WT neonates (P &lt; 0.05). There was a slight increase in serum endotoxin levels in septic MFG-E8 KO mice compared to septic WT mice (37.4 &plusmn; 9 vs. 25.8 &plusmn; 7 EU/ml). Additionally, septic MFG-E8 KO neonates had a reduced induction of phosphorylated AKT, which is an indication of activation of the cell survival pathway, compared to septic WT neonates. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Breast milk protein MFG-E8 can protect neonatal mice from polymicrobial sepsis by suppressing intestinal inflammation and promoting the cell survival pathway.

Contributing to this high mortality is the neonate's functionally distinct innate immune response. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that adjuvant activation via the TLR4 receptor improves outcomes in neonatal sepsis. Unfortunately, TLR agonists (e.g. LPS, resiquimod) are contraindicated in clinical use due to sepsis-like symptoms they induce. Aluminum (alum) salts are currently used as adjuvants in pediatric vaccines to improve immune responses; however, the mechanisms by which alum mediate these responses are incompletely understood. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to determine if alum enhances immune effector cell recruitment and function in the setting of polymicrobial sepsis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  5-7 day old (neonate) C57BL/6J (B6) mice received either no pretreatment (control) or subcutaneous (SQ) injection of aluminum hydroxide (alum; 100 &micro;g) 24 h prior to sepsis. Neonates then underwent intraperitoneal (IP) administration of cecal slurry (CS; LD<sub>25-45</sub>) to induce intra-abdominal polymicrobial sepsis. Following injection of CS, mice were observed for 7 days to determine survival. Peritoneal wash was collected at 0, 2, 6 and 24 h following sepsis. Harvested cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for cell phenotype and phagocytosis activity (E.coli bioparticles).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Subcutaneous alum pretreatment did not alter peritoneal macrophage or neutrophil recruitment following IP septic challenge.

Alum pretreatment 24 h prior to septic challenge also demonstrated improved macrophage phagocytosis at baseline (68.9&plusmn;19.2 vs. 17.8&plusmn;26.6; p&lt;0.05). Peritoneal neutrophil phagocytosis was unchanged at baseline and 6 h following septic challenge.

Alum pretreated neonates had significantly improved survival compared to control animals when challenged with cecal slurry (p=0.023). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We demonstrate here that the vaccine adjunct alum modulates immune effector cell function and improves survival to polymicrobial sepsis in neonates. Alum pretreatment leads to improved phagocytosis in peritoneal macrophages and neutrophils likely influencing this survival advantage.

NK1.1+ cells, which includes natural killer (NK) and Natural Killer T(NKT) cells, play a critical role in graft rejection. Depletion of NK1.1+ cells has been demonstrated to abrogate graft survival of islet, corneal, and cardiac allografts.  We explored the possibility of a B cell-NK/NKT interaction, with the goal of determining whether NK/NKT cells played a role in a mouse model of regulatory B cell-dependent tolerance. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Diabetes was induced in C57BL/6 mice with streptozotocin. In some experiments, CD1d-/- mice, and Beige mice were used. Four to five hundred islets were transplanted into the renal sub-capsular space of diabetic recipients.  Recipient mice received 100 &micro;g anti-mouse CD45RB i.p. on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 following transplantation and 500 &micro;g anti-mouse TIM-1 i.p. on day -1, and 300 &micro;g on days 0 and 5 following transplantation.  Recipients may also receive 200 mg anti-NK1.1 antibody on days -7, +1, and +8.  Regulatory B cells were purified from long-term graft survival animals (&gt;100 days) for adoptive transfer.  Adoptive transfer was performed by intravenous injection of 5x10^6 B cells.Graft survival between experimental groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Wilcoxon statistics.  P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Anti-CD45RB/anti-TIM-1 antibody treatment results in nearly 100% percent long-term graft survival, and reduces the percentage of NK cells but increases the percentage of NKT cells.  The additional administration of anti-NK1.1 abrogates tolerance induction, but did not alter the percentage of TIM-1+ B cells nor the percentage of Foxp3+ T cells. To examine whether anti-NK1.1 antibody interferes with the development of Bregs vs. their effector function, we took advantage of the fact that untreated B cell deficient mice reject islet allografts, but the addition of B cells from tolerant recipients induces tolerance without any antibody treatment to the secondary recipients.  In this model, anti-NK1.1 antibody abrogates tolerance induction by established Bregs.To further delineate the subset of cells necessary for Bregs function. NKT cells deficient mice (CD1d-/-), and Beige mice (functional NK cells deficiency) were transplanted, dual antibody treated and monitored for outcome. In contrast to wild type mice, all Beige mice acutely reject their grafts. Only 30% of NKT deficient mice fail to accept their graft long term.   <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our adoptive transfer study demonstrates that the presence of recipient NK1.1+ cells is necessary for graft survival mediated by Bregs. Rejection as a result of the loss of NK1.1+ cells does not result from a loss of Bregs or of Tregs.

Starzl Transplantation Institute,Department Of Surgery, University Of Pittsburgh School Of Medicine,Pittsburgh, PENNSYLVANIA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Necroptosis is a highly regulated form of cell death that is thought to be triggered by TNF&alpha; when caspase-8 is inhibited. Unlike apoptosis, necroptosis does not lead to fragmentation of DNA. Necroptosis is thought to be dependent on a complex involving receptor-interacting protein 1 kinase (RIPK1), RIPK3, caspase 8, and FADD. RIPK3 is involved in necroptosis while RIPK1 is involved in both apoptosis and necroptosis. Previously, we have shown that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) contributes to liver transplant I/R injury by increasing apoptosis. However, the role of IRF-1 in necroptosis has not been examined.  Our goal in this study is to determine if there is a role of necroptosis in liver transplant I/R injury and to characterize the role of IRF-1 in necroptosis. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Orthotopic murine liver transplant (OLTx) was performed with B6 wild-type (WT) or IRF-1 knockout (KO) donor livers to isograft B6 recipients. Cold ischemia time was 24 hr. Serum was collected at 1, 3, and 6 hr after liver transplant reperfusion for serum transaminases to assess liver injury. Protein was isolated and western blot performed for RIPK1and RIPK3. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: OLTx using IRF-1 KO donor liver isografts resulted in markedly diminished liver I/R injury compared to WT as we have previously shown (graph). Hepatic RIPK3 protein expression was induced 1 to 3 hr after OLTx and returned to baseline by 6 hr (figure).  RIPK3 expression was not observed in isografts that received IRF-1 KO donor livers. Interestingly, the necroptotic form of RIPK1 (78 kDa protein) was mildly increased after OLTx in an IRF-1 independent manner, while the apoptotic form of RIPK1 (40 kDa protein) was not induced.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These findings demonstrate activation of the necroptosis pathway with rapid induction of RIPK3 protein expression during OLTx I/R injury. Moreover, we have identified that induction of hepatic RIPK3 in the liver transplant setting is IRF-1-dependent.  Further studies are needed to better define the mechanism of IRF-1 mediated induction of RIPK3 and necroptosis.  Inhibition of the necroptotic pathway by blockade of RIPK proteins may be a novel strategy to ameliorate liver transplant I/R injury.","Basic Science","Immunology/Transplantation","Transplantation"

Prior studies have shown that neutrophilia leads to NLP. However, it remains unclear why native lungs would develop neutrophilia without any surgical manipulation. Here we show that a unique subset of intravascular monocytes in the donor lungs, which cannot be flushed using current preservation techniques, migrates to the native lung and causes NLP.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Allogeneic single left lung transplant was performed utilizing wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J (B6) CD45.1 donor lungs and Balb/cJ (Bc) CD45.2 recipients as control. In the experimental arms, two sets of donors were used: (1) B6-WT donors treated with intravenous Clodronate-loaded liposomes (Clo-lip) to deplete intravascular Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes, and (2) B6-CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>-/-</sup> (knockout) donor lungs which were deficient in chemokine receptor CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 function and therefore had deficient Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocyte-endothelial cell binding. At 24 hours post-transplant, native right lungs were isolated and prepared for flow cytometric analysis. A sequential gating strategy was used to identify Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils and CD11b<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>-</sup>CD64<sup>+/-</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes and cell counts performed. Student's t-test was used to compare the means.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Donor lungs perfused with current preservative solution demonstrated presence of intravascular CD11b+MHCII<sup>-</sup>CD64<sup>+/-</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes (3% of resident CD45+ cells). Using CD45.1 donors and CD45.2 recipients, we determined that 8% of the Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes in the native lung were donor-derived at 24 hours. Native lungs demonstrated 2.5 fold increased neutrophils following single allogeneic lung transplantation compared to sham operated mice.  Donor treatment with single intravenous injection of Clo-lip depleted these monocytes in the donor lungs (&lt;0.5% of CD45+ cells). Further, in recipients of Clo-lip treated donors, no donor-derived monocytes were found in the native lungs at 24 hours. Donor Clo-lip treatment abrogated native lung neutrophilia (n=7, p=0.03). CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 knockout donor mice had decreased Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes in the pulmonary intravascular space (&lt;0.5%) and allogeneic lung transplant from CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 knockout mice revealed suppressed neutrophilia in the native lungs, similar to donor Clo-lip treatment.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Donor-derived pulmonary intravascular Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes migrate to the contralateral native lung following single lung transplantation and can induce neutrophilia upon reaching the native lungs. The mechanisms that lead to the activation of these monocytes as well migration pathways would provide insight into native lung pneumonitis.","Basic Science","Immunology/Transplantation","Transplantation"

With rising obesity rates in North America, many livers are discarded because of steatosis, the accumulation of fat within the liver.  These extended criteria donor organs are more susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and are associated with reduced viability and increased complication rates after transplantation.  Normothermic ex vivo liver perfusion (NEVLP) has emerged as a means of reducing the IRI associated with cold static storage of livers.  NEVLP may also play a role in actively defatting steatotic livers and thus protect them from IRI.  In this pilot study, we hypothesize that four hours of oxygenated NEVLP will preserve the hepatic architecture of steatotic rat livers, and that supplementing the perfusate with defatting compounds will result in a reduction of hepatocellular lipid content.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Livers were harvested from obese Zucker rats or lean Wistar rats and perfused ex vivo at 37&deg;C for four hours.  NEVLP consisted of membrane oxygenated machine perfusion with a flow rate of 10 mL/min and an initial portal vein pressure of 10 mm Hg.  Livers were perfused with Minimum Essential Medium Alpha Modification medium.  The perfusate was supplemented with bovine serum albumin, fetal bovine serum, human insulin, lactic acid, and heparin at pH 7.4 with or without the addition of four compounds known to stimulate lipid metabolism by consuming or secreting intracellular triglycerides.  Liver tissue biopsies were collected after perfusion for hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Oil Red O staining, and triglyceride (TAG) measurement.  Perfusate samples were collected throughout NEVLP for quantification of TAG and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), a marker of hepatocyte injury.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:H&amp;E results suggest that the viability of steatotic livers can be maintained using NEVLP under physiological conditions.  Steatotic livers are more susceptible to hepatocyte injury during ex vivo perfusion than non-fatty livers.  The defatting agents may provide some protection from this injury as indicated by lower AST levels.  Perfusion of steatotic livers with the defatting agents results in a reduction of intracellular lipid droplets as shown by Oil Red O staining.  However, there is no associated increase in perfusate TAG levels, suggesting that defatting may be occurring by mechanisms other than lipid secretion such as hydrolysis for ketogenesis or beta-oxidation.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:We have shown that four hours of oxygenated NEVLP successfully preserves liver architecture.  Supplementing the perfusate with compounds that promote metabolism through export or oxidation may result in defatting of steatotic livers.  Defatting steatotic livers could improve transplantation success and increase the donor pool.","Basic Science","Immunology/Transplantation","Transplantation"

Mitochondria are unique organelles that evolved from a bacterial origin and have retained immunologic epitopes that activate the innate immune system similar to bacterial pathogens.  We examined the effect of mitochondria as endogenous innate immune activators ex vivo and in vivo.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Mitochondria isolated from mouse fibroblast (LMTK) lysate was performed by differential centrifugation methods followed by affinity purification using TOM22 specific antibody coated magnetic beads.  Purity of mitochondrial fractions was confirmed by western blot and qPCR for mitochondrial specific proteins and DNA, respectively. Cultured dendritic cell (DC2.4) and macrophage (RAW 264.7) cell lines were incubated with increasing concentrations of mitochondria and assessed for upregulation of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, and CD86) by flow cytometry.  Cell culture supernatant was assessed for inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and MCP-1) by cytometric bead assay. In vivo assay of the inflammatory response to mitochondria was performed by injecting mitochondria derived from LMTK cells or rho zero (mitochondrial DNA-deficient) LMTK cells into WT or MyD88-ko C57BL/6 mice and enumerating neutrophil and monocytes amongst peritoneal exudate cells (PECs).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Exposure of macrophage and dendritic cells to highly purified mitochondria resulted in increased expression of costimulatory molecules and increased inflammatory cytokine production in both cell lines. Intraperitoneal injection of mitochondria led to robust PEC accumulation consisting of activated neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes. The PEC inflammatory response was greatly reduced in MyD88-ko mice compared to WT. PECs were also diminished when mitochondria lacking mitochondrial-DNA (mtDNA) were injected.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These data support a role for mitochondria in the inflammatory response to tissue injury.  By serving as endogenous innate immune activators, mitochondria can activate antigen-presenting cells and provoke the infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes. The components of mitochondria that are key to these processes remains to be determined, but our data suggests they are dependent on mitochondrial DNA, and/or the products of mitochondrial gene expression.","Basic Science","Immunology/Transplantation","Transplantation"

Neutrophil infiltration into the allograft mediates PGD. However, the mechanisms that lead to neutrophil trafficking remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that a unique subset of intravascular monocytes, that cannot be flushed using current preservative techniques, leads to PGD following lung transplantation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Murine allogeneic left lung transplant was used for these studies. Neutrophil infiltration was determined using intravital 2-photon microscopy and flow-cytometry. Graft function was determined using arterial oxygen after clamping the right hilum for 5 minutes. Intravenous clodronate loaded liposomes (Clo-lip) was used to induce apoptosis in circulating monocytes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Perfused murine lungs demonstrated intravascular CD11b<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>-</sup>CD64<sup>+/-</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes (Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M) that constituted ~3% of resident CD45<sup>+</sup> cells. These Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M shared functional phenotype with CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes detected in perfused human lungs. Pre-treatment of donors with Clo-lip depleted Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M in donor lungs (&lt;0.3%). Following murine allogeneic left lung transplant, there was a robust neutrophil infiltration on intravital 2-photon imaging (Fig 1A) that was prevented by a single dose of Clo-lip in the donors. Donor Clo-lip treatment resulted in preserved allograft architecture and oxygenation at 24 hours (Fig 1B&amp;C). Treatment with anti-CCR2 antibodies which selectively deplete Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes, but not Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M, worsened neutrophilia (3 folds) and graft function. Homozygous deletion of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 chemokine receptor resulted in absent Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M in the lungs without affecting circulating Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M, indicating a role of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 binding to its ligand CX<sub>3</sub>CL1 expressed on endothelium. CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup> donor lungs demonstrated suppressed neutrophilia (2.5 fold reduction) and preserved function. The CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-CX<sub>3</sub>CL1 covalent bonds were calcium dependent and were neutralized by ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) resulting in flushing of Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M during perfusion. Reconstitution of Clo-lip treated donor lungs with MyD88-TRIFF knockout Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M, with deficient Toll signaling, failed to restore allograft neutrophilia, in contast to wild-type Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pulmonary intravascular Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M are a novel subset of monocytes that cannot be flushed using standard preservative techniques. Donor Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M, transplanted along with the donor lungs, are activated through TLR pathway mediating neutrophil trafficking and PGD. Ly6C<sup>low</sup>M are bound to the donor endothelium using covalent bonds that can be neutralized using a calcium chelator.

A new method of resuscitation, Direct Peritoneal Resuscitation (DPR), improves gut and hepatic perfusion, prevents vital organ edema, and down-regulates systemic inflammation, and thus, prevents gut-derived alarmins such as HMGB1 or LPS in the systemic circulation.  Previous studies showed that DPR increased organs transplanted per donor (OTPD) due to increased suitability of lungs in human organ donors.  We hypothesized that DPR benefits in gut and liver could improve lung function, in particular, decrease sICAM-1, as well as integrin-?L (i.e., CD11a or LFA-1) and integrin-?M (i.e., CD11b or MAC-1).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  ~~Anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=44 total) were randomized to groups: 1) ABD with minimal IV RES (Low IVF); 2) ABD + mid-range IV RES (Mid IVF); 3) ABD with aggressive IV RES (High IVF); or 4) ABD + IV RES + DPR (IVF+DPR).  ABD was induced by inflation (1 mL/hr) of a supra-dural balloon catheter (4F angioplasty) until the loss of blink and withdrawal reflexes.  Ventilation was started (TV=1.6mL, rate=80) with the onset of apnea.  After the appearance of the characteristic Cushing response, IV fluid RES was started and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded.

A large percentage of donor livers have significant steatosis. Previous research suggests improvement in steatosis in the immediate post-transplant period. This study compares reperfusion and early post-transplant surveillance biopsies, and correlates the results with initial graft function and long-term outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Records of all liver transplants (LTs) performed at a single center over a 14-year period were reviewed. The original biopsies were reviewed by experienced liver pathologists. Liver biopsies are obtained at the time of transplant and 3 days after transplant. Total steatosis is calculated as the sum of both micro- and macrovesicular steatosis, and is categorized into four study groups:  (1) none (0%), (2) mild (&lt;10%), (3) moderate (10-20%) and (4) severe (&gt;20%). For this analysis, change in liver steatosis is calculated as moving from one study group to another. Early post transplant liver function is assessed by biochemical analysis of liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT); liver injury), total bilirubin (TB; excretion), international normalized ratio (INR; synthesis).  Long-term survival is assessed using Cox regression analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Data were available for 1572 adult subjects. Among the patients with steatosis, there was a significant and rapid decrease in steatosis. The median group change was greatest for severe steatosis groups (Group 3, &gt;20%: -1.54; Group 2, 10 to 20%: -0.93; Group 1, 1 to 10%: -0.47 (p&lt;0.001). Moderate and severe steatosis was associated with more acute liver injury (p&lt;0.05 for days 1 to 6), and delayed graft function (higher TB and INR (p&lt;0.05 on days 1, 3)). These values decreased for all study groups until they were similar by day 7 (ALT) and day 14 (TB and INR). Systemically, steatotic groups demonstrated an acute decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 1 to 3 days post transplant, ranging from -12 to -22% change, compared to only a -5% change for the nonsteatotic group. Graft survival was worse at all time periods for moderate and severe steatosis livers. Subgroup analysis was employed to identify groups that have a more dynamic decrease in steatosis. Those groups with better clearance of severe steatosis included recipients who were younger, more obese, male, and those with fatty liver disease.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:These results confirm a marked post-transplant decrease in allograft steatosis that occurs within 3 days of transplant. Subgroup analysis suggests that younger male patients who are obese or have fatty liver disease are more able to clear steatosis in this period. Allografts with moderate to severe steatosis have worse early injury, delayed graft function and worse early and late survival. Steatotic grafts are associated with a substantial acute decrease in renal function early post transplant.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

However, recent research increased the estimated lifetime risk of ESRD among LKDs to 0.9% (Muzaale 2014, Mjoen 2014). Given this new data, we sought to elicit potential LKDs' willingness to accept the risk of ESRD. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a multicenter prospective study of adults undergoing evaluation to become directed LKDs. We created a 10,000 dot diagram representing a 0-100% chance of ESRD to help LKDs visualize absolute and relative risks of ESRD at baseline and post-nephrectomy. LKDs selected the maximum chance of post-donation ESRD that they were willing to accept. LKDs completed surveys about risk-taking propensity, emotional closeness to their intended recipient, health, and demographics. Due to a non-normal distribution, willingness to accept ESRD was broken into quintiles. Univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression assessed factors associated with willingness to accept ESRD.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Our sample comprised 103 LKDs (87% response rate) from 3 transplant centers.

Male mice subjected to orchiectomy one wk prior to ischemia exhibited improved renal IRI tolerance and universal survival (n=5, Figure 1).  Neutered male mice treated with estrogen (n=5) demonstrated further improvement in post-IRI renal function compared to vehicle treated neutered mice (n=5, p=0.03, Figure 1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Gender-specific protection from renal IRI can arise from the presence of estrogens or the absence of androgens.  Administration of &beta; -estradiol beginning at 16-hrs pre-injury mitigates renal IRI in female and manipulated mice.  This time course is compatible with perioperative use in procedures anticipated to involve a period of renal ischemia.  While further investigations are warranted to test whether these exciting data can translate to beneficial outcomes in larger animals, we conclude that hitherto unrecognized effects of estrogens on IRI have profound consequences for renal function post-surgery.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

The optimal treatment for hemorrhagic shock is to reverse circulatory losses, metabolic acidosis, and cellular hypoxia with blood products, but these are often not available for immediate administration.  Alternative approaches to initial resuscitation are needed, especially in resource poor environments.  Amitriptyline is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effects.  We have previously demonstrated that treatment of blood products with amitriptyline leads to decreased lung injury after hemorrhage, but the direct effect of amitriptyline in treatment of hemorrhage is unknown.  We hypothesized that administration of amitriptyline after trauma and hemorrhage would improve survival in a non-resuscitation injury model.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Healthy C57/BL6 male mice underwent laparotomy to induce tissue trauma and hemorrhage via femoral artery cannulation to a mean arterial pressure of 25&plusmn;5mmHg for 60 minutes. After laparotomy closure and decannulation, mice received amitriptyline (0.1 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of vehicle (50 uL of normal saline) via intraperitoneal injection. For survival analysis, mice underwent the above treatment (n=10/group) and were monitored for 24 hours. For hemodynamic and blood chemistry analysis, mice (n=5/group) underwent the same injuries and treatments as described above and were sacrificed 60 minutes after treatment. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Administration of amitriptyline after trauma and hemorrhage significantly increased 24-hour survival in mice (Figure 1; 70% survival with amitriptyline vs 0% with vehicle; p&lt;0.001). Sixty minutes after trauma and hemorrhage, mice treated with amitriptyline also had significantly increased mean arterial blood pressure (p=0.04). Blood gas analysis revealed that mice treated with amitriptyline had statistically significant improvements in base deficit and serum bicarbonate, consistent with decreased metabolic acidosis.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results demonstrate that administration of amitriptyline significantly improves survival in mice after trauma and hemorrhage, even in the absence of resuscitation.  We found that amitriptyline increases mean arterial blood pressure and decreases metabolic acidosis after injury. Administration of amitriptyline following traumatic injury could potentially be useful in situations with limited access to blood products.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

We therefore endeavored to test a hypothesis analogous to the familiar Koch's third postulate, wherein the causal agent of disease will transfer that disease state to a healthy organism. In our case, the causal agent in question was not infectious, but rather was plasma from coagulopathic trauma patients with platelet dysfunction. We hypothesized that plasma from coagulopathic trauma patients would cause inhibition of healthy donor platelets, and that this toxic effect would be associated with a shift in the plasma proteome. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We isolated platelet free plasma from 171 trauma activation patients, of which 8 were severely coagulopathic with severe platelet dysfunction. This plasma was mixed 1:1 with whole blood from healthy donors. Comparison was made to plasma from non-coagulopathic trauma patients and healthy donors (control). Platelet inhibition was measured using whole blood impedance aggregometry with TRAP and ADP agonists (ROTEM Platelet, Tem GmbH). Proteomic analysis of plasma samples was conducted using the QconCat platform (PolyQuant, GmbH). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Plasma from severely coagulopathic trauma patients with platelet dysfunction, conveyed significant inhibition in platelet function to donor platelets (p=0.049); see figure. Plasma from non-coagulopathic trauma patients did not significantly decrease healthy donor platelet function, compared to exposure to self plasma. A subset of plasma samples, which inhibited healthy donor platelets &ge;50% (p=0.0025), demonstrated significant proteomic shifts, including massive upregulation of alpha-enolase , GAPDH, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, and alcohol dehydrogenase 1B, along with loss of coagulation factor V. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Plasma from coagulopathic trauma patients with platelet dysfunction is capable of conveying this dysfunction to healthy donor platelets. This pathogenic transfer is likely the result of a soluble toxic factor, as it is associated with an upregulatory proteomic shift, that is not buffered by healthy whole blood. These findings have two implications: (1) that it is critical to correct the platelet-inhibitory circulatory milieu of a coagulopathic trauma patient (e.g. with plasma resuscitation) before transfusing patients and (2) that the unidentified toxic soluble factor may represent a drug target for preserving platelet function in trauma patients.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

PLG is cleaved by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)and yields plasmin, which degrages fibrin.  Neutrophil proteases, such as elastase, can also modify PLG and produce angiostatin, which retains the fibrin-binding site of plasmin without the proteolytic domain.  Previous animal work has demonstrated that hemorrhagic shock increases fibrinolytic activity while tissue injury reduces fibrinolytic activity while both causing a depletion of PLG. We hypothesize trauma patients with hyperfibrinolysis and fibrinolysis shutdown will have decreased PLG compared to trauma patients with normal fibrinolytic activity and healthy controls, and that angiostatin is a potent inhibitor of fibrinolysis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 150 trauma activations were screened and, patients(n=10) with the lowest fibrinolytic activity(shutdown) were contrasted patients with the highest fibrinlytic activity(hyperfibrinolysis n=10), normal fibrinolytic activity(physiologic n=10) and healthy controls(n=10). PLG levels and firbrinolytic regulator proteins were measured in each of these cohorts.  Exogenous angiostatin and elastase were mixed ex vivo in healthy volunteer blood (n=6) and challenged with tPA to promote fibrinolysis.  Fibrinolysis was quantified by the LY30 variable using thrombelastography (TEG).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:PLG levels were decreased in shutdown and hyperfibrinolytic patients compared to trauma patients with physiologic activity and healthy controls (p&lt;0.001). Fibriolytic regulator protein were also depleted in these phenotypes (figure1). Exogenous angiostatin reduced LY30 by 62% (p=0.046) in tPA challenged blood of healthy volunteers.  Elastase also reduced LY30 by 96% (p=0.046). Additional clotting parameters were not effected by the addition of angiostatin in whole blood with and without tPA.  However, elastase reduced R time by 30% (p=0.028) with and without tPA (-34% p=0.028) and increased angle by 33% with tPA (p=0.075).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Depletion of plasminogen post injury is associated with the hyperfibrinolytic and fibrinolysis shutdown phenotype.  The breakdown of PLG may be the result of different mechanisms.  Exogenous elastase promotes a hypercoaguable clot that is resistant to fibrinolysis, which is a common hemostatic derangement of patients in the surgical intensive care unit. These data support inflammation initiates an alternative utilization of PLG promoting post injury fibrinolysis resistance despite depletion of other fibrinolytic regulatory proteins.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

An<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Chicago,Surgery,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Current predictive models for sepsis generally use correlative methods, and as such are limited in their individual precision due to patient heterogeneity and data sparseness. In particular, the inability of these methods to capture the clinical dynamics and mechanisms of sepsis limits achieving true prediction. Other fields of science have used computational modeling and simulation to help contextualize multi-dimensional data arising from complex systems in order to describe their behavior. Advances in supercomputer-aided modeling can provide this same capability to biomedical research. Herein we begin this process by defining the behavioral possibility space for sepsis across a range of physiological, microbial and environmental parameters, and apply advanced mathematical analysis to identify predictive metrics for system outcome.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  80 million microbial sepsis patients were simulated representing a 28-day hospital course using a previously validated agent-based model (ABM) of sepsis implemented on a Cray XE6 supercomputer. Parameter space was examined regarding system response with and without antibiotics regarding the following parameters: cardio-respiratory-metabolic resilience; two properties of microbial virulence, invasiveness and toxigenesis; and degree of contamination from the environment. Simulation data was analyzed using varied tiers of multi-dimensional space, which was then subjected to mathematical analysis using deterministic chaos and bifurcation theory.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The identified parameter space had a clear structure with plausible boundaries reflecting the range of possible human behavior in response to microbial sepsis (Fig 1). The central region of highest outcome uncertainty corresponds to the critically ill population. Analysis of this region using chaos and bifurcation theory identified basins of attraction leading to three outcomes &ndash; complete recovery, hyperinflammatory system failure, and overwhelming infection - in a 32-dimensional phase space defined by various chemokine concentrations and their conjugate generalized momenta. These basins of attraction were used to develop metrics for prediction of individual outcomes based on networks of mediator and cell population levels.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Supercomputing simulations of sepsis can play a vital role in the contextualization of both big data output and mechanistic basic science research. The representation of the aggregate set of individual trajectories facilitates formal mathematical analysis and is a necessary step towards developing truly predictive models and precision therapies.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

Survival and bacteriological analyses of the blood, lung was studied. DsRNA-TLR3 complex inhibitor was used to assess the effect on survival. Additional experiments were performed to evaluate the effect on lung injury and inflammation by cellular and cytokine analyses of the lung/Broncho-alveolar lavage. In separate experiments alveolar macrophages were isolated and markers of M1/M2 phenotype and apoptosis were assessed by Flow cytometry. Finally flow cytometry was performed to measure the amount of dsRNA staining (J2 ab) of the BAL cells. Standard ANOVA was used to measure statistical difference with an attributed significance of p&lt;0.05.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Survival and bacteriology. Compared to WT mice, TLR3 (-/-) mice that received the bacteria inoculation concurrently or 6 hours following LC had significantly lower mortality. The TLR3 (-/-) mice had reduced bacteria in the lungs with the TLR3 (-/-) mice with no bacterial colonies in the blood at 24 and 48 hours (WT-115-120 colonies), after bacterial challenge. The mortality in WT mice was partially reversed (50%) by the administration of dsRNA/TLR3 complex inhibitor.The WT mice show increased lung injury and inflammation following lung contusion and pneumonia. Lung morphology of TLR3 (-/-) mice revealed reductions in lung inflammation following pneumonia. TLR3 (-/-) mice had reduced BAL albumin (permeability injury) and cytokine (IL1 &beta;, KC) levels following LC + pneumonia and pneumonia alone. The levels of lung IL-1&beta; and myeloperoxidase were lower in the TLR3 (-/-) mice subjected to LC + pneumonia and pneumonia alone group compared to corresponding WT .The WT mice show increased M1 expression than TLR3 (-/-) with more of the M1 and M2 alveolar macrophage undergoing apoptosis following LC+pneumonia.

Intestinal epithelial cells and their associated tight junction proteins are crucial for regulating intestinal permeability. Junctional Adhesion Molecule A (JAM-A) is a protein found in the intercellular tight junction that has been implicated in regulating gut barrier function.  Previous studies have shown that JAM-A<sup>-/-</sup> mice have increased gut mucosal permeability at baseline. However, how intestinal permeability and overall survival are altered in JAM-A deficient mice during sepsis has yet to be determined.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 6-8 week old male and female C57Bl/6 (WT) or JAM-A<sup>-/-</sup> mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Following sepsis, mice were followed for seven days for survival or sacrificed at 24 hours for functional studies. Intestinal permeability was assessed by quantifying serum fluorescent dextran (FD-4, 4.4kDa) following oral gavage 5 hours prior to sacrifice. Blood and peritoneal cultures were taken via sterile cardiac puncture and peritoneal lavage, respectively, and incubated on sheep blood agar plates for 48 hours before quantification. A Log-Rank test was performed for survival studies. For two-way comparisons, a Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test was performed depending on Gaussian distribution and a p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Intestinal permeability was increased in JAM-A<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to WT mice (mean, 1031&plusmn;516.3 ng/ml vs. 699&plusmn;295.1 ng/ml, p=0.04, n=13-15).

The emergence of multidrug resistant organisms has mitigated the efficacy of many antibiotics. Recent genomic studies have shown FER, a cytosolic non-receptor tyrosine kinase of unknown role in the lung, with increased gene expression among survivors from sepsis and pneumonia. Our hypothesis is that using electroporation-mediated (EP) delivery of the FER gene we can improve survival in a murine model of combined LC and PNA. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  C57Bl/6 mice were subject to a lethal model of unilateral LC followed by intratracheal inoculation of 500 CFU of Klebsiella sp. at 6 hrs. In the treatment group, plasmid DNA encoding FER (pFER) was provided via hypopharyngeal instillation right after LC injury (time 0.2 hr). External electrodes were placed under each forelimb and 8 square wave electroporation pulses were delivered. Two control groups were used: one receiving Na+/K+-ATPase genes (shown to be benefitial in LC injury model) in similar LC+PNA injury conditions followed by EP (pPump); and a second with no gene delivery (LC + PNA/no EP). 7-day survival curves were recorded. In a parallel experiment, animals were euthanized at 24 hrs post-LC, lung mechanics were measured and bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BAL), blood and lung tissue were collected. BAL cellular subpopulations were immunotypified by flow cytometry. BAL cytokines were assayed using ELISA kits for IL-1&alpha;, IL-6, IL-10, IL-33, MCP-1 and MIP-2. Quantitative bacterial counts were determined by serial dilution and plating of blood and lung homogenates. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 7-day survival was markedly improved by pFER treatment compared to positive (pPump) and negative-controls (LC+PNA/no EP). Better lung compliance was found in pFER animals at 24 hr post-LC. At this same timepoint, pFER treatment group showed a robust inflammatory response with absolute increases in BAL monocytes, neutrophils and macrophages. In contrast, BAL of pPump treated animals was macrophage-predominant while negative-controls had a relative lower total of inflammatory cells, especially of macrophages, compared to the other groups. pFER treatment diminished levels of early response pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&beta;, IL-6, MCP-1 and MIP-2, whereas increases were seen in modulation-cytokines IL-10, IL-33 and TNF-&alpha;. Lung bacterial counts were significantly lower in pFER (ANOVA p=0.023) with a trend towards better systemic containment.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: EP-mediated delivery of the FER gene significantly improved mouse survival in a combination model of lung contusion and pneumonia. Better containment of bacteria within the lungs was possibly mediated by alterations in the immune cell and cytokine response.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

The total direct cost derived from institution-specific Medicare cost-to-charge ratios were evaluated. Patient age, race, sex, severity of illness, socioeconomic status, insurance status and procedure details were used to generate a case-mix adjusted predictive model of cost based on a random 15% subset of the study population. This was then validated on the remainder of the sample. Observed to expected (O:E) costs for each center was evaluated between centers based on overall procedure volume.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Patient characteristics, pre-op diagnosis, extent of resection, use of laparoscopy and percentage of elective operations were significantly different between volume tertiles.

Still, a significant proportion of laparoscopic cholecystectomies are performed in hospitals, not ASCs. The objective of this study was to identify the number of patients who underwent hospital-based laparoscopic cholecystectomy that could have safely undergone surgery in an ASC. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database (HCUP-SID) and State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database (HCUP-SASD) were used to identify patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in California hospitals from 2006-2011 and California ASCs in 2011. Inpatients with a postoperative stay greater than 48 hours were excluded from analysis. Patients who were converted to laparotomy, died, or were readmitted within 30 postoperative days were considered unsuccessful.  Preoperative variables including comorbidities, diagnosis, CCI, and age were used to generate uplift predictive models to estimate individual success of undergoing surgery at an ASC compared to a hospital. Uplift modeling measures the quantitative effect (lift) of a treatment on the probability of a successful outcome. Patients with positive lift were predicted to benefit from having surgery in an ASC. Prospective cost savings was estimated using normalized charge data.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:18,096 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in hospitals and 37,477 in ASCs met our inclusion criteria. Hospital patients were older (52.1 vs. 46.8 yrs, p&lt;0.0001) and had higher CCI (0.41, 0.28, p&lt;0.0001) than ASC patients. Readmission rates were higher for hospital than ASC patients (3.5%, 2.7%, p&lt;0.0001), as were rates of conversion (0.07%, 0.02%, p=0.009) and mortality (0.03%, 0.01%, p=0.028). Using an uplift model (lift threshold &gt;0.05%), we predicted 13,988 hospital patients could have successfully underwent surgery at an ASC with a mean lift of 0.008. The mean cost per encounter was $7,857 for these patients, compared to reported mean cost of $6,028 for laparoscopic cholecystectomy at ASCs. Therefore, if the patients who underwent hospital-based laparoscopic cholecystectomy were instead cared for at ASCs, the resultant cost savings would be an estimated $5.1M annually.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The use of ASCs for performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is increasing, however patients with favorable preoperative characteristics still undergo surgery in the hospital. Using uplift modeling to identify patients who would be expected to have successful outcomes after surgery at both ASCs and hospitals, we demonstrate that ASCs remain underutilized at significant financial cost.","Outcomes/Clinical","Cost Effectiveness","Cross Disciplinary"

This has led to adoption of Lean operation principles by organizations as a means of eliminating waste and improving operational efficiencies.  Lean requires an understanding of operational costs, utilization and capacity for services.  physician ordering often shows high variability due to individual provider practices, complicating understanding utilization rates.  We believe that standardized implementation of national practice guidelines can serve to provide a framework to reduce waste and better quantify utilization requirements.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Our hospital has an established preoperative anesthesia service (PES) for elective cases to improve outcomes through a standardized preoperative process.  Evaluation of ordering practices demonstrated large variability in the use of preoperative electrocardiograms (ECG) by the operative team.  We analyzed the ECG ordering practices for patients undergoing elective surgery at our institution for a 25-day period from February-March 2012 to identify both total utilization and review compliance with published American Heart Association guidelines on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and care for noncardiac surgery.  We then implemented an evidence-based ECG ordering algorithm (figure 1) based on these guidelines and studied changes in ordering patterns and associated direct costs and hospital billing for the same period in 2013.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Evaluation of the 2012 data showed 677 noncardiac surgical procedures were performed at our institution.  Of these, 312 (46.1%) had a preoperative ECG performed.  After standardized implementation of our evidence-based ECG ordering algorithm for the same period in 2013, we performed a total of 707 noncardiac surgical cases. During this period only 120 (16.9%) had a preoperative ECG performed.  Total preoperative ECG utilization dropped by 63% (2,575 ECGs/year).  At an estimated institutional direct cost per ECG of $16 this resulting in an annual saving of $41,000.  Our average reimbursement per ECG is $64, resulting in $164,800 in annual healthcare savings at our institution.  According to the CDC over 100 million surgical procedures performed in the United States annually. If our medical center's preoperative ECG ordering practices is reflective of the average US hospital, broad implementation of these guidelines could save the healthcare system as much as $1,868,800 per year. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Here we demonstrate that the standardized application of national standard practice guidelines may be use a tool to eliminate substantial financial waste from the healthcare system while still delivering optimal patient care.","Outcomes/Clinical","Cost Effectiveness","Cross Disciplinary"

Current technologies for continuous RR monitoring require some level of patient-sensor contact. The most accurate and current gold standard is invasive monitoring through ventilator-acquired capnography in intubated patients. Current noninvasive systems suffer from movement artifact, sensor-contact failure, inaccurate data and limited patient mobility. There is a critical need for an accurate, reliable and inexpensive non-contact system for RR monitoring. A contact-free radiofrequency (RF)-based monitoring system utilizing standard Wi-Fi technology was developed in our laboratory and designed to detect movement within human habitable structures. In this study we investigate its ability to measure fine movements associated with human respiration.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The two-unit, omnidirectional dual-antennae, transceiver system was further developed to attempt to detect human respiration. In brief, the system measures Wi-Fi ((802.11n) 2.4GHz &amp; 5GHz) signal diffraction caused by the subject's inhalation and exhalation and then uses a Fourier transform to convert the signal into interpretable data. Under IRB approval, we initiated feasibility testing on healthy control subjects using a software application created in our lab that uses visual cue, fixed-tempo instruction for subjects to breath at various standard RRs. Blinded application-based RRs were then compared to RF-acquired experimental data.Next we studied our RF-based technology on ventilator-dependent ICU patients in the immediate post-operative period after open-heart surgery. Study patients received standard post-operative care including use of a full-body thermal air warmer and cotton blankets. Prior to patient entry into the ICU, the two-unit RF system was positioned in the patient's room approximately 10 feet apart. Blinded ventilator capnographic RR data was collected and later compared to RF-acquired experimental data.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Control application data from 10 subjects breathing at a fixed RR (14,16,18 or 20) demonstrated 95.5 percent measurement accuracy between the patient's actual rate and that measured by our RF-technology. (Table 1)We then enrolled 10 post-operative open-heart patients into a clinical trial. Blinded ventilator capnographic RR data showed 88.8 percent measurement accuracy with concurrent RF data. (Table 2)<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Initial clinical pilot trials with our contact-free RF-based monitoring system demonstrate a high degree of RR measurement accuracy when compared to capnographic data. Based on these data, we believe RF-based systems present a promising noninvasive, inexpensive and accurate tool for continuous RR monitoring.","Outcomes/Clinical","Clinical Trials","Cross Disciplinary"

Alvimopan is a competitive, selective &micro;-opioid receptor antagonist that has been extensively studied (with variable reported rates of efficacy) in regards to its ability to aid GI tract recovery in abdominal surgery patients.  This meta-analysis critically examines the clinical and financial impact of impact of alvimopan on GI recovery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (1966-2015) was completed.  Search terms were, &lsquo;alvimopan', &lsquo;entereg', &lsquo;ADL 8-2698', &lsquo;Surgery', and &lsquo;randomized controlled trial'.  Outcomes analyzed were time to tolerance of solid food and first bowel movement, time to hospital discharge order written, and opioid use. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Seven RCTs involving 2,955 abdominal and pelvic surgery patients receiving alvimopan 12mg versus placebo were included in this analysis.  1,644 patients received alvimopan 12mg and 1,311 received placebo two hours before the start of surgery and twice daily for seven days or until hospital discharge.  2,558 patients underwent bowel resection, 700 patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, 159 underwent radical hysterectomy, and 227 underwent radical cystectomy.  Alvimopan 12mg was associated with a statistically significant reduction in mean time to tolerance of solid food and first bowel movement (SDM -0.326; 95% CI -0.411 to -0.240, p&lt;0.001) as well as mean time to discharge order (SDM -0.215; 95% CI -0.301 to -0.130, p&lt;0.001).  No significant reduction in postoperative opioid use was identified in the included studies.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Alvimopan significantly aids post-operative recovery after abdominal and pelvic surgery as measured by a significant decrease in return to GI function and time to hospital discharge order.  No difference in opioid requirement is attributable to alvimopan use.  Alvimopan should be considered an effective adjunctive aid to bowel recovery for patients undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery. Alvimopan use in other types of surgery requires additional investigation.","Outcomes/Clinical","Cost Effectiveness","Cross Disciplinary"

However, numerous policy changes aimed at incentivizing high quality care are aimed at shifting more of this burden to providers. To better understand the impact of these policies, we sought to evaluate the costs associated with surgical quality and the relative burden on hospitals and payers.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We merged complication data from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) to internal accounting data available at the University of Michigan hospitals, and examined 5,121 episodes of surgical care during a period between January 2, 2008 and April 16, 2015 for 24 surgical procedure groups (17 general surgical, 6 vascular, and 1 gynecologic). We used log-transformation with multiple linear regression to model risk-adjusted costs for episodes of care, accounting for patient factors and case-mix. We compared adjusted hospital costs, third party reimbursement (i.e., payer costs) and hospital profit margin for cases with and without complications.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The overall complication rate was 26% for all procedures (25% for general surgery, 33% for vascular, and 23% for gynecologic). For all studied procedures combined, mean hospital costs were $16,079 higher for patients with complications ($31,091) compared to those without complications ($15,012). Likewise, mean third party reimbursement was $15,118 higher for patients with complications ($31,137) compared to those without complications ($16,019). Consequently, overall profit margin decreased by 6.9%, from 8.1% for patients without complications to 1.2% for patients with complications.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Hospitals and third party payers experience increased costs with surgical complications, with hospitals experiencing a reduction in profit margin. Both hospitals and payers appear to currently have financial incentives to promote surgical quality improvement.","Outcomes/Clinical","Cost Effectiveness","Cross Disciplinary"

Targeted nutrition interventions have well-established benefits in critical-care and general surgery trauma populations, but have not been studied in a large cohort of orthopedic trauma patients.  The aim of this study was to evaluate a targeted daily nutrition intervention in this population, and to measure its impact on biochemical indices of nutrition and clinical outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adult patients (age 18-65 years-old) admitted to the orthopedic surgery service with extremity fractures were included in this trial.  Patients were excluded if they had multi-system injury which required admission to another surgical service.   Upon admission, subjects were randomized to receive either: a) daily nutrition counseling from a dietitian with supplementation of antioxidants, micronutrients, and protein or b) standard-of-care.  Serum levels of albumin, pre-albumin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin were obtained on days 1,3,7 and at 2 weeks.  The number of missed meals, daily protein and calorie intake, length of hospital stay, and the incidence of wound infections were also recorded.  A student's t-test, Pearson's chi-square test, and multiple linear regression were used to ascertain statistical significance. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:80 subjects were enrolled (40 in each arm). The cohort was 46% female, with a median age of 47.  72% had fractures of the femur, tibia or ankle, and 15% had fractures of the humerus or forearm.  Over the first week, intervention and control arms showed no differences in the median number of missed meals [6 (3.5-8) versus 4.5 (2.5-8.5), p=0.31], grams of protein intake [240 (165-401) versus 289 (149-378), p=0.91], or calorie intake [6035 (4592-9081) versus 7234 (4321-9832), p=0.64].   Intervention and control arms did not differ in any of the measured biochemical indices of nutrition (Table 1). A subgroup analysis comparing patients in the upper quartile of calorie and protein intake to those in the lower quartile also revealed no differences in nutrition labs.  There were fewer wound infections (0 versus 4, p=0.04) in the intervention arm. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:During the first week of admission, daily nutrition counseling does not appear to impact calorie, protein or meal intake in orthopedic trauma patients.  Moreover, traditional biochemical indices for nutrition status do not correlate well with levels of intake.   These data may indicate that current metrics for evaluation of nutrition status and intake are not clinically relevant in this population.  This highlights a need for alternative diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic targets in nutrition science.","Outcomes/Clinical","Clinical Trials","Cross Disciplinary"

Previous studies of surgery costs have suggested that minimally invasive approaches are associated with shorter length of stay and fewer complications but higher intraoperative costs. We aimed to examine if esophagectomy surgery technique affected costs.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A retrospective review was performed for consecutive patients who underwent esophagectomy between January 2012 and December 2014 at a single academic medical center. Hospital cost data, pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables were collected. Esophagectomy techniques were grouped into open (thoracotomy and laparotomy), hybrid (either video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) or laparoscopy for one part of the surgery), minimally invasive (both VATS and laparoscopy), and transhiatal (THE).Univariate and adjusted multivariable analyses were performed to assess the impact of surgery type on total hospital cost associated with esophagectomy. Data presented as median (IQR); costs presented in thousands of dollars.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 80 patients identified, there were 11 THE, 11 open, 41 hybrid, and 17 MIE cases. Median total cost of the hospitalization was $31.4 ($26.5-$48.5), and was similar between surgical technique groups. MIE was associated with significantly higher intraoperative costs and trended towards lower ICU costs (Table). Multivariable analysis revealed the presence of a complication, increased age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class IV (ASA4), and preoperative coronary artery disease (CAD) were associated with significantly increased cost. Presence of a complication accounted for an adjusted increase of $17.4 in total cost, while ASA4 was associated with an adjusted increased total cost of $47.2. Preoperative diagnosis of hypertension was associated with cost savings of $21.2 in the overall regression model.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: MIE is associated with higher operation costs.  Despite this, the total hospital cost was not different between surgical technique groups.  Postoperative complications and severe preoperative comorbidities are significant drivers of hospital cost associated with esophagectomy. Surgeons should choose technique based on clinical factors and minimization of postoperative complications, rather than for cost implications.","Outcomes/Clinical","Cost Effectiveness","Cross Disciplinary"

A pooled analysis of this data was performed to examine risk factors for development of delirium. Each delirium event was defined by the onset of new delirium (n=151 events), and that individual patient-day was evaluated for triggering events compared to delirium free days (n=1,093). Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze which factors were independently predictive of triggering delirium.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Pain score on the triggering days of delirium averaged 3.7/10 for the first episode per patient, and 3.5/10 on all triggering days, compared with 2.9/10 for days without delirium (p&lt;0.05). Sleep-hours were also significantly less leading up to the delirium trigger days (4.1 hours versus 4.9 hours, p&lt;0.001).  Univariate analysis with all variables revealed age, sodium, and creatinine to also be statistically significant but without clinically modifiable impact. Regression modeling showed both ungrouped pain score (OR 0.919, 95% CI 0.851-0.992) and sleep-hours (OR 1.202, 95% CI 1.096-1.319) to be independently significant in predicting delirium.

ERAS patients were matched 1:2 by gender, race, indication, and procedure with pre-ERAS patients from 2013-14. The ACS-NSQIP Risk Calculator was used to calculate an expected LOS for each patient. Pre-ERAS and ERAS patients were stratified by race. Chi-square, paired t-tests and Wilcoxon Rank Sums tests were used to determine differences among categorical and continuous variables. Primary and secondary outcomes included the observed and observed-to-expected difference (OED) in post-operative LOS, respectively.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 180 patients examined (60 ERAS and 120 pre-ERAS patients), 48.6% were women and 22.8% were black. The mean age of our cohort was 57. Indications for surgery included cancer (61%), diverticulitis (16%), inflammatory bowel disease (12%), and other benign disease (11%). Procedures included low anterior resections (27%), ileocolic resections (24%), partial colectomies (20%), stoma reversals (19%), total colectomies (8%), and ileal pouch-anal anastomoses (2%). The average ACS-NSQIP expected LOS was 5 days for both groups. Compared to pre-ERAS patients, ERAS patients had a significantly reduced post-operative LOS (4.7 vs. 6 days, p=0.01) and improved OED (-0.4 vs. +1.1 days, p=0.01).

The Balance Budget Act of 1997 helped financially protect these safety net hospitals by entitling them to increased imbursements through Medicare.  Recent studies suggest that CAHs provide lower quality care for common medical admissions. Little information, however, is known about the outcomes and costs of patients admitted for surgical procedures. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   We performed a cross-sectional retrospective review of 1,318,872 Medicare beneficiary admissions to critical access and non-critical access hospitals for surgical procedures between 2009 and 2012. Critical access hospitals were identified using data from American Hospital Association registry. For those who underwent one of four common types of surgical procedures (Appendectomy, N=125,759 (9.5%); Cholecystectomy, N=474,113 (36.0%); Colectomy, N=472,897 (35.9%); Hernia Repair, N=246,103 (16.6%)) we compared 30-day mortality, complications as well as the associated costs. A multivariate logistical regression was used to adjust for patient factors (age, gender, race, Elixhauser comorbidities,) year of operation and type of operation. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Patient treated at critical access hospitals for surgical procedures were less medically complex. For example, although patients treated at critical access hospitals were older (average age 76.5 versus 75.7, P &lt;0.0001), they were less likely to have heart failure, diabetes, obesity or multiple comorbidities ( % of patients with &ge; 2 comorbidities; 59.9% versus 69.6%, P&lt;0.0001.) Even with these patient factors accounted for in our multivariate model to compare to non-critical access hospitals, critical access hospitals had decreased 30-day mortality rates (4.2% versus 4.7%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.96; P=0.005) and decreased total complications (13.1% versus 22.4%; OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.49-0.55; P&lt;0.001.)

We collected patient demographics, including age, race, gender, and insurance status. The proportion of patients age &ge;17 undergoing elective surgery was determined. We dichotomized the time period (2000-2006 and 2007-2012) to evaluate temporal trends. We reported patient demographics, insurance coverage and types of procedures performed in each time period.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Between 2000 and 2012, there were 28,642 patients hospitalized with a primary or secondary diagnosis of TS or GID. Among patients &ge;17 years, 3,203 (11.2%) underwent apparent gender affirming surgery, and an additional 2,194 (7.7%) underwent other types of elective surgery. Among the 3,203 adult patients undergoing gender affirming surgery, 33% had a diagnosis of TS, 34% GID, and 33% both TS and GID. Among patients undergoing gender affirming surgery in 2000-2006, the mean age was 41.7 years, 41% had missing gender information, 92% were white, and the payer was most commonly self (70%) or private insurance (20%).

In insured populations, older age, female sex, Black race, comorbidities, and hernia defect size have been shown to be predictors of emergent ventral hernia repair. However, predictors of emergent repair have not been assessed in a nationally representative US population. We sought to identify patient- and hospital-level factors associated with non-elective repair in order to identify targets to improve access to elective repair.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Adult patients (&ge;18y) who underwent inpatient ventral hernia repair (ICD-9CM primary diagnosis 551.1x-551.2x, 552.1x-552.2x, 553.1x-553.2x and procedure 46.42, 53.4x-53.6x) were abstracted from the 2003-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample.

Significant risk-adjusted independent predictors of non-elective repair included payer status (uninsured: OR 3.50, 95%CI [3.10, 3.96]; Medicaid: 1.29 [1.20, 1.39] compared to private insurance), race/ethnicity (Black: 1.77 [1.64, 1.92]; Hispanic: 1.44 [1.28, 1.61] compared to White), age (65-75: 0.77 [0.72, 0.83]; &ge;85 2.23 [2.00, 2.47] compared to &lt;45), and comorbidities (CCI 1: 1.13 [1.09, 1.18]; 2: 1.24 [1.17, 1.30]; &ge;3: 1.68 [1.56, 1.80] compared to 0). Patients undergoing non-elective repair had higher risk-adjusted odds of death (2.58 [2.08, 3.22]), a 26% [24, 29]  relative increase in length of stay and a 15% [12, 17] relative increase in total hospital cost. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A substantial proportion of inpatient ventral hernia repairs are performed non-electively, with worse outcomes in this group. Independent predictors of non-elective repair include no insurance, Medicaid, non-White race/ethnicity, age &ge;85, and multiple comorbidities. While octogenarians and patients with comorbidities have increased odds of non-elective surgery, possibly due to deferral of elective repair, those aged 65-75 have decreased odds, possibly due to increased elective care utilization as Medicare becomes available. Poor access to elective surgical care may contribute to the worse outcomes in the identified groups at risk. Efforts to improve access have potential to mitigate disparities in outcomes from ventral hernia repair.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Immediate breast reconstruction has been shown to lead to higher rates of surgical satisfaction, minimize delay in post-operative cancer treatment, and improve the quality of life and overall well-being of mastectomy patients. However only 25-40% of eligible women in the United States receive reconstruction. The rate of reconstruction is even lower in African American and Hispanic women compared to White women. In an effort to better understand this disparity, this study uses national population-based data to examine how demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, and disease characteristics interact and affect the rate of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) after mastectomy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Women with AJCC7 Stage 0-III breast cancer who underwent mastectomy from 2010 to 2012 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) database. Race, Hispanic ethnicity, age, marital status, insurance status, tumor grade, AJCC7 stage and hormone receptor/ Her2Neu profile were compared between women undergoing mastectomy with IBR and mastectomy alone using univariate and multivariate analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 51,115 women who underwent mastectomy for Stage 0-III breast cancer from 2010-2012, of whom 15,389 (30.1%) received IBR. On multivariate analysis, age (p&lt;0.0001), marital status (p&lt;0.0001), race (p&lt;0.0001), Hispanic ethnicity (p&lt;0.0001), grade (p = 0.0045), insurance status (p&lt;0.0001), AJCC7 stage (p&lt;0.0001), and ER/PR/Her2 receptor status (p&lt;0.0001) were all independantly associated with IBR. Patients more likely to receive IBR were younger (age &lt; 40: OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.95 &ndash; 2.29; age 40 &ndash; 49: OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.57 - 1.75) and presented at a less advanced stage (stage 0: OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.62 &ndash; 2.16; stage I: OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.30 &ndash; 1.44). Factors independently associated with not receiving IBR were race/ethnicity (Black race: OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.70 - 0.81; Hispanic ethnicity: OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.57 - 0.66), insurance status (uninsured: OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.34 - 0.46; Medicaid: OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.34 - 0.39), Tumor grade 3 (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.88 - 0.98), advanced stage (stage III: OR 0.64, 95% CI = 0.60 &ndash; 0.68), and triple negative disease (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.74 - 0.85).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The decision to undergo reconstruction after mastectomy is influenced by many factors. Our results show that even after adjusting for tumor characteristics, socioeconomic factors are independently associated with receiving IBR after mastectomy.  Further research is needed to elucidate the factors that influence the decision to undergo IBR in order to eliminate these persistent disparities.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Laparoscopic surgery (LS) for EP is associated with shorter length of stay and operation time along with less intra-operative bleeding. Racial disparities in laparoscopic surgery (LS) for ectopic pregnancy (EP) are documented and are generally attributed to unequal access to care. The objective of this study was to determine if racial disparities exist in the receipt of LS for EP among universally insured population.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using 2006-2010 TRICARE (universal insurance coverage to all members of US Armed Services and their dependents) claims data, tubal EP patients who received surgical intervention (LS or laparotomy) for EP within 48 hours and 30 days of diagnosis were identified using ICD-9 and CPT codes. Cases were then stratified into direct (military hospital) or purchased (civilian hospital) systems of care. Patient demographic characteristics were compared between each racial group (White, Black and Asian/Pacific Islander). Unadjusted and adjusted odds of receipt of LS in each racial group for surgeries performed within 48 hours and 30 days of diagnosis were compared adjusting for patient demographics, system of care and severity of EP. Sub-analysis for odds of receipt of LS for each racial group within direct and purchased care systems was performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Among a total of 2680 tubal EP who received surgical intervention, 1620 (60.4%) received LS and 1060 (39.5%) received laparotomy for EP within 30 days of diagnosis. Ninety-one percent of these surgeries were performed within 48 hours of initial diagnosis and 52% were performed within purchased care system. Among all cases identified, 1692 (63.13%) were White, 169 (6.31%) Asian and 819 (30.56%) Black. Overall, 40.9% of White women received LS compared to 32.1% Asian and 33.7% Blacks (p-value: &lt;0.001) within 48 hours. On multivariable analysis adjusted for demographic factors, system of care and severity of EP, Blacks were 30% less likely to receive LS for EP within 48 hours of initial diagnosis. These disparities were not present within the direct system of care (OR: 0.92; CI: 0.70-1.22) but were only present within the purchased system of care (OR: 0.53, CI: 0.38-0.72). Similar trends were seen for surgeries performed within 30 days of initial diagnosis. [See Table]<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Black women were less likely to receive LS for EP within purchased care (civilian hospital) in the universally insured TRICARE population. These findings might help inform policy changes to ensure equal access to advanced surgical options among all beneficiaries irrespective of race and system of care.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

We sought to evaluate the impact of universal health insurance on outcomes following surgical interventions among beneficiaries of Department of Defense (DoD) TRICARE health insurance.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: TRICARE claims data (2006-2010) were queried to identify all individuals who received one of 12 surgical interventions (Table).  Race, gender, socio-economic status, environment of care, and 30-day morbidity, including readmission and reoperation, were assessed for all patients.  The environment of care was defined as direct for those who received their surgery in a DoD hospital and purchased for individuals treated at a non-DoD facility using TRICARE insurance.  Individuals with missing race were excluded from the denominator and analysis was limited to  patients identified as African-American or Caucasian. Reweighted estimation equation method was used to reducebias introduced by excluding patients with missing race.  Thirty-day mortality following surgery complications, readmission and reoperation were the dependent variables.  Unadjusted comparisons between African-Americans and Caucasians were performed, followed by weighted multivariable logistic regression that adjusted for differences in case-mix and the type of surgical intervention.    Analyses were repeated to evaluate the impact of racewithin direct and purchased care facilities.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The cohort consisted of 11,402 African-Americans and 69,729 Caucasians.  The mortality rate for the cohort as a whole was 0.15% while complications were sustained by 15.6%.  Readmission occurred in 10.2%.  Final adjusted analysis revealed that African-Americans were not at elevated odds of mortality following surgical intervention (OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.70, 1.85).  They were, however, found to be at increased odds of sustaining a complication (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.04, 1.22) and readmission (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.07, 1.25).  These findings persisted among patients treated within the purchased care system [OR for complications 1.18; 95% CI 1.07, 1.31; OR for readmission 1.19; 95% CI 1.08, 1.31), but were absent for those who received direct care at a DoD facility.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Some disparities were present between African-American and Caucasian patients receiving surgery within a universal payer system, but the differences are markedly reduced as compared to prior reports regarding surgical care. Furthermore, no disparities were present for those patients treated at intrinsic DoD facilities.

It has been demonstrated that timely surgical intervention for gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies are associated with improved outcomes and reduced costs. We sought to examine the association between race and time to treatment in a cohort of patients hospitalized for surgical cancer care.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We identified all patients who underwent a surgical resection for colon, rectal, pancreas or stomach cancer in NY and CA (2008-2011). Patients were excluded from study if they were transferred from another facility or resided out-of-state. Race was classified as white or black. Patients were classified as F24 if they underwent surgery in the first 24 hours following the index admission for the known malignancy.  Descriptive statistics were performed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare patient and hospital characteristics by F24 status. Subset analysis was performed by malignancy type. A Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 31,425 patients who underwent a cancer resection, there were 28,115 (89.5%) white patients, and 3,310 (10.5%) black patients.

Black and white patients differed significantly on many pre-operative characteristics (see table). In multivariate analysis, black patients had a significantly reduced likelihood of F24 when compared to white patients (OR 0.71; 95%CI 0.64-0.79). In 3 independent multivariate models developed by malignancy type, black patients were significantly less likely to F24 for colon cancer (OR 0.77; 95%CI 0.69-0.87), rectal cancer (OR 0.53; 95%CI 0.38-0.74) and stomach cancer (OR 0.52; 95%CI 0.37-0.74).

Patients without health insurance may not be eligible to access rehabilitation services following treatment for lower limb trauma, which could delay hospital discharge. We hypothesized that uninsured patients are less likely to be discharged to rehabilitation facilities and so have prolonged length of stay (LOS) in hospital.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The California State Inpatient Database (SID) (2007-2011) was queried for all patients with a primary diagnosis of lower limb skeletal trauma (ICD-9-CM 808, 821-828). The SID is a comprehensive population cohort that includes 98% of hospital admissions in California, with unique patient identifiers that permit tracking across different hospitals. Patients that died in hospital were excluded. Multivariable logistic and generalized linear regression models were used to risk-adjust outcomes for differences in patient- (age, sex, race, payer status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Injury Severity Score, weekend admission, admission source) and hospital-level factors (trauma center designation, hospital bed size). All regression models accounted for clustering of patients within hospitals. The principal comparison in all analyses was between uninsured and privately insured patients. A sub-group analysis was performed that excluded patients with isolated hip fractures. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 283,472 lower limb trauma admissions were identified. 192,181 (67.8%) were supported by public insurance (Medicare and/or Medicaid), 60,208 (21.2%) were privately insured, and 11,340 (4.0%) were uninsured. The insurance status of the remaining patients (7.0%) was unknown.In the unadjusted analyses, self-pay patients were considerably less likely to be discharged to another facility than those with private insurance (9.9% versus 35.0%, &Chi;<sup>2 </sup>p&lt;0.001). LOS was however slightly shorter in the uninsured group (4.5 versus 4.9 days, Kruskal-Wallis p&lt;0.001). Fewer uninsured patients required readmission to hospital within 30 days (3.4% versus 12.5%, &Chi;<sup>2</sup> p&lt;0.001).Within the risk-adjusted analyses, uninsured patients were less likely to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital or skilled nursing facility (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.18-0.25). Their adjusted length of stay was 0.87 days longer (95% CI 0.61-1.14) than for patients with private insurance. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of 30-day unplanned readmission to hospital (uninsured OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93-1.22). These findings all persisted when patients with isolated hip fractures were excluded. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Uninsured patients are less likely to be discharged to post-acute care facilities following lower limb trauma and have prolonged LOS compared to privately insured patients. Further work should explore whether reduced access to post-discharge rehabilitation services is associated with worse functional outcomes and greater overall healthcare costs.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Standard statistical methodology was used.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Among 863,958 BC patients, 4,289 (0.5%) were NAs and 859,669 (99.5%) were Caucasians. The majority of BC in both groups occurred in those 60 to 79 years (43.7% Caucasians and 33.5% NA). NA women had a higher incidence of BC at a younger age (9.2% vs. 5.1% for age 20-39, and 51.8% vs. 38.1% at age 40-59, p&lt;0.001), as well as a higher rate of regional (34.0% vs. 31.3%) and distant metastasis (7.9% vs. 6.1%).

However, implementation of these programs&mdash;most notably Medicaid expansion&mdash;remains incomplete. Approximately 1/5<sup>th</sup> of US trauma patients ages 18-64y are uninsured, and lack of insurance may increase the risk of potentially impoverishing catastrophic health expenditure--previously defined as any expense exceeding 10% of annual household income. We aimed to use a nationally-representative patient sample to determine the proportion of uninsured trauma patients admitted to a hospital who incurred catastrophic medical bills. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Uninsured patients ages 18-64y who were admitted for traumatic injury (ICD-9-CM 800-959) were abstracted from the 2007-2011 National Inpatient Sample (NIS). To provide a more detailed estimate of median household income, patients were matched to data obtained from the US census bureau, wherein zip codes were ranked by median income into quartiles and linked to states. State and median zip code household income quartiles were matched to the corresponding NIS variables to provide an estimated household income for each patient. Charges were determined by the NIS total hospital charges billed to each patient. Proportions and estimations were calculated using nationally-representative discharge scaling weights provided in the NIS.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 117,497 patients (weighted to represent 579,656 patients nationwide) were included. Median estimated household income was $44,287 (IQR: $35,456-$56,646). Median total hospital charges were $26,339 (IQR: $14,575-$47,941). The proportion of uninsured trauma patients with total charges exceeding 10% of estimated household income was 95.8% (95% CI: 94.7-96.9%).  The proportion of uninsured trauma patients with total charges exceeding 40% of estimated post-subsistence income was 71.6% (95%CI: 69.4-73.8%). When scaled to the total US population, these proportions imply an estimated total of 555,385 (95%CI: 496,728-614,041) uninsured trauma patients ages 18-64y incurred catastrophic medical bills between 2007-2011--equivalent to 110,077 patients per year (95%CI: 99,346-122,808) patients per year.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Applying an established definition of catastrophic heath spending, estimates from a nationally representative sample suggest that over 95% of uninsured patients ages 18-64y incur catastrophic medical bills if hospitalized for a traumatic injury in the US. Surgeons should take note, especially in states in which Medicaid has not been expanded, that nearly all of their uninsured trauma patients are at risk of financial catastrophe. Whether through enhanced insurance coverage or other means of improving access to affordable care, providers and policy makers should take note and promote efforts that favor financial risk protection for patients.","Outcomes/Clinical","Health Policy","Cross Disciplinary"

We sought to characterize national variations in hospital markup for major cardio-thoracic (CT) and hepato-pancreatico-biliary-gastrointestinal (HPB-GI) surgical procedures, as well as examine perioperative outcomes at hospitals with extreme markup.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All hospitals in which a patient underwent a CT (n=577,275) or HPB-GI (n=618,700) procedure were identified using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for 2012. Charge-to-cost ratios(CCR) were compared across hospitals. In-hospital outcomes were examined relative to 'extreme markup'(&ge;75<sup style=""line-height:1.6em"">th</sup> percentile).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among the 17,490 hospitals identified, median CCR was 2.8 (IQR 2.7-3.9).  4,373 hospitals that treated 411,540 patients were in the highest CCR quartile (range, 3.9-12.2) (Figure). While patient age, gender and insurance status were not associated with extreme markup hospitals (all p&gt;0.05), minority patients were more likely to be treated at high CCR hospitals (non-extreme CCR: 20.3% vs. extreme CCR: 30.4%, p&lt;0.001).

Extreme mark up hospitals had higher perioperative morbidity (non-extreme CCR: 26.4% vs. extreme CCR: 32.7%), failure-to-rescue (non-extreme: 10.2% vs. extreme CCR: 12.2%) and mortality (non-extreme CCR: 3.2% vs. extreme CCR: 4.4%, all P&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Many patients undergo surgery at hospitals charging over 4-times Medicare-allowable cost. Extreme markup hospitals had worse perioperative outcomes than non-extreme markup hospitals.

We sought to characterize variations in hospital costs for several surgical procedures and quantitate the variability attributable to the patient, procedure, and provider.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (AAA), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), pancreatectomy or colectomy between 2009 and 2013 were identified at a large tertiary care hospital. Inter- and intra-provider variations in costs were compared using coefficient-of-variation (CV). Multivariable hierarchical linear modeling was utilized to quantitate variation in total hospital costs attributable to the patient, procedure and provider.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among the 4,802 patients that underwent surgery, the average cost of surgery was $34,697 (SD=25,844) ranging from $11,177 (SD=$4,955) for LC to $63,654 (SD=54,046) for AAA repair. While perioperative complications resulted in increased cost (no complication: $25,864, SD=16,838 vs. complication: $47,171, SD=72,692, p&lt;0.001), total hospital costs remained variable even among patients without complications (p&lt;0.001, Figure).  Substantial variation in total costs was observed among surgeons performing the same surgery (CV: CABG, 103%; AAA, 104%, LC, 69%, pancreatectomy, 82%; colectomy, 122%).  Further, marked variations in costs were also observed within the same surgeon performing the same surgery (CV: CABG, 21%-116%; AAA, 26%-111%, LC, 19%-107%, pancreatectomy, 31%-101%; colectomy, 17%-155%). After accounting for patient comorbidity, postoperative complications and length of stay, 90% of total variability was explained by patient- and procedure-related factors, while 10% was attributed to variations in surgeon practices.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Hospital procedure costs varied markedly among and even within providers. While patient level factors explained most of the variation in cost, up to 10% of the variation was due to provider-level differences, which can be a potential target for cost containment.","Outcomes/Clinical","Health Policy","Cross Disciplinary"

In a GI cancer model, the study aimed to examine treatment patterns and observed costs in the in-patient setting to understand the impact that VBP may have on patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A retrospective cohort study was performed using inpatient claims from California and New York (2008-2011) for all patients admitted with a new diagnosis of colon, rectal, stomach, or pancreatic cancer regardless of the intended treatment plan.  Patterns of treatment, surgical and non-surgical, and associated costs during the index admission for cancer were examined. Patient characteristics were compared by treatment pattern using the Chi square test. Univariate costs were compared using the Kruskal Wallis test. Log-transformed wage-adjusted total costs were compared using multivariate linear regression.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 75,177 patients, there were 39,207(52.2%) colon cancer, 14,020(18.7%) rectal cancer, 12,341(16.4%) pancreatic cancer, and 9,609(12.8%) stomach cancer admissions. Patients admitted with a new diagnosis of colon cancer were most likely to be treated with surgery during the index admission(81.8%) compared to 61.3% of rectal cancer patients, 23.5% of pancreas cancer patients and 43.1% of stomach cancer patients(p&lt;0.001). 34% of surgical patients underwent an operation within 24 hours of admission. The median cost per admission was $20,819(IQR 12,448-34,928). Cost was greatest for patients with stomach cancer($24,168; IQR 12,861-43,978) and least expensive for pancreas cancer patients($19,474; IQR 10,506-36,708) (p&lt;0.001). Cost for patients who had surgery during the index admission($24,177; IQR 15,311-38,714) differed from that those who did not($15,351; IQR 8,767-27,673)( p&lt;0.001). Among patients who underwent an operation during the index admission, the cost was significantly less for those who underwent surgery within 24 hours of admission($21,606; IQR 13,990-34,396) when compared to those that were admitted for &gt;24 hours before surgery($27,360; IQR 17,251-43,801) (p&lt;0.001). The direction of the relationship between cost and treatment type and timing of surgery remained the same after adjustment for potential confounders.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Surgical care remains the definitive therapy for solid GI cancers with variable cost depending on tumor type. Not all patients are receiving surgical treatment at the time of admission. Patients that are ready for surgery at the time of admission incur less costly care. The goal of bundled cancer care should be timely diagnosis and referral for definitive surgical care.  Optimizing outpatient health status prior to admission may result in substantial cost savings. While VBP offers sensible features for cost containment for insurers and employers, the current inefficiencies in utilization of in-patient services will ultimately lead to greater costs incurred by the patient.","Outcomes/Clinical","Health Policy","Cross Disciplinary"

Therefore, we measured IRB review times across the research portfolios of 10 large VHA IRBs.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We collected the IRB records pertaining to a random sample of research protocols from the research portfolio of 10 VA IRBs, stratified by review type (i.e., exempt, expedited, full board). We included IRBs operated by the VA, and based on the number of actively managed protocols, we sequentially approached the 26 largest IRBs to achieve our target sample of 10 participating IRBs, including the VA Central IRB. Using detailed maps of each site's review process, two independent analysts abstracted time data from the IRB records from which we calculated the overall and incremental review times. Multivariable models assessed differences between site, review type and and increments of the IRB review process.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We obtained documentation for 278 protocols: 48 exempt, 106 expedited and 124 full board. Raters agreed on 3038 of 3090 time points (98.3%) abstracted from a sub-sample of 72 (22.4%) protocols. Total review time ranged from 24 to 310 days, with means of 93&plusmn;51, 107&plusmn;54, and 131&plusmn;63 days for expedited, exempt and full board protocols respectively. Multivariable models using robust variance estimation controlling for site and review level demonstrate that, on average, expedited reviews were 45 days faster than full board reviews ( 95% CI = 31-59 days). There was no significant difference between full board and exempt reviews. However, after subtracting the time required for Research and Development (R&amp;D) Committee review, both exempt and expedited reviews were 21 (95% CI = 1-41) and 39 (95% CI = 23-55) days faster than full board reviews, respectively, in the subgroup of protocols for which we could determine the time for R&amp;D Committee Review (N = 178). Finally, when compared to Site 1, full board reviews at Sites 3, 8 9 and 10 were 27 (6-48), 38 (12-63), 45 (20-69) and 24 (1-46) days faster, and Site 6 was 56 (28-84) days slower (ranges show 95% CI).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:IRB review times differ significantly between sites and review types. Some sites approach a consensus panel goal of 60 days for IRB review, but other sites need improvement to reach this goal. Review times for exempt protocols are unexpectedly long due to delay with the R&amp;D Committee review. These data could inform site-specific initiatives for reducing the time required for IRB review.","Outcomes/Clinical","Ethics/Bioethics","Cross Disciplinary"

The relationship between surgeon volume and outcomes for patients undergoing orthognathic surgery has not been reported. We examined the relationship between surgeon volume and hospital length of stay (LOS), and total hospital charges for patients undergoing the two most common orthognathic procedures, namely segmental osteoplasty/osteotomy of maxilla or open osteoplasty/osteotomy of mandibular ramus.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All patients undergoing the aforementioned procedures as in-patients were selected from the 2002 to 2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Year-specific annual procedure volumes were calculated for each surgeon and dichotomized into low- and high volume groups (&lt;10 vs. &ge; 10 procedures/year respectively). The relationship between year-specific annual volume and the likelihood of extended patient LOS (defined as LOS &ge; 75<sup>th</sup> percentile) was examined using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for patient and hospital-level factors. Possible provider-volume related differences in total charges were examined using a generalized linear model, with a log-link and gamma distribution also adjusting for patient and hospital-level factors.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Among the 3,705 patient admissions eligible for inclusion, age ranged between 4 days to 80 years, with 68.7% of patients being between 15-30 years of age. Annual surgeon volume ranged from 1 to 36 with a mean of 6 (SD=7) procedures/year. Overall, 81.2% of procedures were performed by low-volume surgeons and 46.8% of surgeons performed 3 or fewer procedures annually. In univariable analyses, patient demographics did not differ between high and low volume providers. Also, no surgeon-volume-related differences were observed between teaching and non-teaching hospitals. Patients treated by high volume surgeons demonstrated 34% lower odds of experiencing extended LOS (OR 0.66 95% CI: 0.46-0.95) after adjusting for patient demographic factors, insurance status, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics (rural vs. urban, teaching status and bed-size). There was no association between surgeon volume and total hospital charges after adjusting for potential confounders.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Regionalization of patients to high volume surgeons/centers for surgical treatment has been recommended for specific subsets of surgical patients, including those with major trauma and requiring certain cardiac, cancer or gastric bypass procedures. Our findings suggest the possibility that similar regionalization strategies might reduce the likelihood of extended LOS for patients undergoing orthognathic procedures.","Outcomes/Clinical","Health Policy","Cross Disciplinary"

We aimed to understand how performance of pancreaticoduodectomy (PD) at different safety-net burden hospitals affects cost and outcomes, and how redistribution of patients from low performing hospitals to high performing hospitals could improve cost-effectiveness.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Hospitals performing PD were queried from the University HealthSystem Consortium database (UHC; 2009-2013) and grouped according to safety-net burden (proportion of Medicaid and uninsured patient charges, as previously described). A decision analytic model was then constructed, populated with UHC clinical and DRG-based cost data. Primary endpoints were perioperative mortality, readmission, and cost (index hospitalization plus readmission, when applicable). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine how primary endpoints were affected by alternative distribution of patients between hospital types and clinical outcomes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 15,090 patients populated the final dataset. Low (LBH), medium (MBH) and high (HBH) burden hospitals were comprised of 4,220 (28%), 9,505 (63%) and 1,365 (9%) patients, respectively. Perioperative mortality was twice as high at HBH (3.7%) than at LBH (1.6%) and MBH (1.7%) (p&lt;0.001).  In the base case, when all clinical and cost data were considered, PD at HBH hospitals cost $35,628/patient, 35% and 55% higher than MBH ($26,357) and LBH ($22988) hospitals, respectively.  This increased cost at HBH hospitals was associated with a significantly higher readmission rate (23%) than at MBH (18%) and LBH (15%) hospitals (p&lt;0.001. Patients at HBH hospitals were more likely to have extreme severity of illness (SOI) (18.8%) than at MBH (12.8%) and LBH (11.4%) but less likely to have moderate SOI (74.2% vs. 78% and 79.4%, respectively) (p&lt;0.001). After patient SOI-adjusted equal redistribution of all HBH to LBH and MBH hospitals, per patient cost remained significantly lower at LBH ($25,594; 39.2% less) and MBH ($27,860; 27.9% less), with a readmission rate of 18% (vs. 23% at HBH in the base case).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: HBH perform a minority of PDs, but have higher readmission and perioperative mortality rates at significantly higher costs. Redistribution of patients from HBH to LBH/MBH&mdash;adjusted for patient-specific risk&mdash;demonstrates significant improvement in clinical outcomes, with a potential for over $2M in annual cost savings. While patient-specific factors partially contribute to sub-optimal clinical outcomes, these data show that inherent hospital characteristics are important in optimizing cost-effective PD care, and that certain hospital types may not be optimally equipped for complex pancreatic surgery.","Outcomes/Clinical","Health Policy","Cross Disciplinary"

Despite decades of interest in this question, little is known about the potential costs of increased patient travel.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We studied all radical pancreaticoduodenectomy inpatient admissions to hospitals that exceeded low-volume thresholds (more than 6 operations per year) among Maryland residents from 2004 &ndash; 2012 (N = 1,277).  We used general linear regression models to assess the relationship between the total cost of hospitalization and distance patients traveled controlling for patient demographics, complexity and severity. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Maryland residents traveled an average of 34.6 miles (median 19.5) for surgery.  Admissions costs averaged $46,597 (median $36,803). Total costs were higher from patients living further from their hospitals.  Compared to patients in the lowest quartile of hospital distance (who lived fewer than 8 miles from their hospital), patients in the second distance quartile (8 &ndash; 20 miles) incurred an additional $5,205 in admissions costs (p = 0.001), while those in the highest quartile (47 &ndash; 300 miles) had an additional $4,616 in total costs (p = 0.055).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Greater patient travel distance was associated with increased costs for pancreaticoduodenectomy.

Large international genomic initiatives are also plagued by high rates of missing data. Despite this little attention has been paid to the impact of these errors on translational research findings.The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of clinical data omissions and errors on cancer genomic analysis by comparing gene associations before and after clinical data revision for our colorectal cancer dataset using simulated analyses.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Primary colorectal cancer tumour samples were collected between 1996 and 2007 at a single institution. Clinical information matched to each sample was prospectively collected for at least 5 years. RNA was isolated from these tumour samples and hybridized to microarray chips. Microarray analyses were performed using the statistical software &lsquo;R'.Review of the clinical annotations of 205 samples elucidated the presence of data inconsistencies, which were then revised.Simulations were performed using &lsquo;R' scripts to assess the influence of data inconsistencies on gene expression and disease free survival (DFS) for our cohort and for a cohort downloaded from the online GEO repository (GSE17536).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In our dataset staging data were found to be missing for 50% of samples, and disease recurrence data for 25% of patients.

Such omissions and inconsistencies may be explained largely by factors such as evolution in staging practice and re-categorisation of events including metachronous disease.

However, the current level of hospital performance on these measures is unknown as is correlation across measures within hospitals.  As such, the study objectives were to evaluate trends in hospital NQF metric performance over time and to assess within hospital inter-metric correlation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This was a retrospective cohort study of surgically resected, stage I-III colon cancer patients using the National Cancer Data Base (2003-2009).  Hospital compliance with 3 NQF metrics (&ge;12 LN pathologically examined [ALNE]; AC administered to stage III patients; AC administered within 4 months of diagnosis for stage III patients &lt;80 years of age) were calculated.  Facilities were stratified into individual metric performance categories (very low [0-25%]; low [25-50%]; high [50-75%]; very high [&gt;75%]).  Performance over time, metric correlation among stage III patients, and factors associated with increasing metric achievement were evaluated using the Cochrane-Armitage test, Cramer's V test, and multivariate multinomial regression, respectively.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 199,815 colon cancer patients treated at 1449 hospitals, there were significant improvements in all 3 metrics (ALNE&mdash;52.5% 2003 vs 84.4% 2009; AC administration&mdash;75.0% vs 80.9%; timely AC&mdash;69.3% vs 75.0%; trend test, p&lt;0.001 for all).  Over time, the proportion of patients who achieved all 3 metrics (42.5% vs 67.2%, trend test, p&lt;0.001) and the proportion of hospitals in the very high performing category for each metric increased from 13.9% to 73.1% for ALNE (trend test, p&lt;0.001), 56.6% to 64.1% for AC administration (trend test, p&lt;0.001), and 46.6% to 53.8% for timely AC (trend test, p=0.014).  The proportion of very high performing hospitals for all 3 metrics collectively increased significantly over time (15.7% in 2003 vs 42.1% in 2009, p&lt;0.001) with good correlation between the two AC measures (V=0.84 in 2003 vs 0.80 in 2009), but poor correlation with ALNE (V&lt;0.1).  In a subgroup of patients at low risk for a postoperative complications, hospital aggregate metric performance was better (20.7% vs 52.4%, p&lt;0.001), but correlation with ALNE was still poor (V&le;0.1).  Patient age, sex, comorbidity, and comprehensive cancer/academic programs were independently associated with metric performance.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:  Despite significant national improvement on each NQF metric individually, less than half of hospitals currently perform well on all 3 metrics collectively.  This suggests quality improvement efforts directed at diseases benefiting from multimodality treatment could be made more robust by shifting focus from the individual components of care in isolation to the entire multidisciplinary care pathway and/or transitions from one treatment modality to the next.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Continuous variables were analyzed using Pearson correlations and multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the contribution of multiple predictors of interest.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 268 of 315 patients consented to participate in the study and 184 returned both surveys and saliva samples. 70 survey respondents (31%) indicated a moderate Distress Thermometer score of 4-6 which triggered an offer of referral to a social worker and 56 respondents (25%) indicated a severe Distress Thermometer score of 7-10, which triggered an offer of a referral to the Psycho-oncology service. The Distress and Impact Thermometer scores were highly correlated (R=0.78, p &lt;.0001) with each other but not with psoas area or density measurements. In multivariate analysis, higher salivary cortisol (p=.02), lower age (p=.009), and presence of mental health cormorbidities (p=.001) were significantly correlated with the Impact Thermometer but not the Distress Thermometer score.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Distress is a common and serious comorbidity among cancer patients and warrants the attention it has drawn from accrediting bodies. Our data suggest that the patient-reported impact of distress may be a better indicator of a stressed physiologic state than distress itself, and that distress and frailty are not correlated. Patient reported measures of the impact of distress, when used in combination with physiologic measures of stress, can contribute to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of distress and its underlying psychodynamic processes. These data could ideally be used to inform the development of appropriate, targeted interventions to alleviate the impact of distress and thereby enhance the quality of cancer care and outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Estimated performance rates standard is 90%. The objective of this study is to examine historically compliance to these rates in California.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using California Cancer Registry 2000-2011, we evaluated female breast cancer cases that met breast measure criteria for radiation within 1 year. Patients were excluded if radiation treatment data were not available. We examined rates of compliance to the breast measure and recommendations for radiation and evaluated differences by patient and hospital characteristics using Chi-Square tests. Tests for Trend by Age and Year of Diagnosis were examined Cochran - Armitage Trend Test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Among the 77,522 cases examined, 55,691 (71.8%) were compliant with the breast measure of having received radiation within 1 year of diagnosis.  Among the 21,831 cases that did not have radiation within 1 year, 519 (2.4%) had radiation more than a year after diagnosis, 16,407 (75.1%) were not recommended radiation, 910 (4.2%) refused, and 41 patients (0.2%) had a contraindication due to other conditions. Rates overall varied by year from 66.8% to 74.4% (Chi &ndash; Square p&lt;.0001). Married women were more likely to comply with guidelines than women who were not married (73.2% vs 70.3%, p&lt;.0001). Non-Hispanic Whites were most likely to comply with guidelines (74.2%), followed by Asian/Pacific Islanders (72.2%), Hispanics (67.1%), Other Races (66.9%), and Non-Hispanic Blacks (62.4%, p&lt;.0001). There was a significantly increasing trend in compliance with age (p&lt;.0001), patients age 18-25 had lowest compliance at 60.2% and patients age 56-69 had highest compliance at 73.8%. Medicaid (65.3%) had the lowest rate of compliance (p&lt;.0001). Los Angeles County, which contributes the largest number of patients in this cohort, had the lowest rate of compliance at 58.1% and the Northern California Bay Area including Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo counties had the highest rate of compliance at 82.3% (p&lt;.0001). There was an increasing trend in compliance by SES quintile, Lowest SES had lowest compliance (64.0%) to highest SES (75.9%, p&lt;.0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This study points to disparities in compliance to radiation within 1 year of diagnosis of breast cancer.

We aimed to quantify and predict variability that exists in resource utilization following pancreaticoduodenctomy (PD) and determine how such variability impacts post-operative outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The University HealthSystems Consortium (UHC) database was queried for all PDs performed between 2011-2013 from 116 centers (n=9,737). A composite resource utilization score was created using equally weighted z-scores of 8 clinically significant post-operative care delivery variables based upon our institutional post-PD care plan. These included number of lab tests, imaging tests, CT scans, days on antibiotics (excluding day of procedure), days on anticoagulation, days on anti-emetics, days on pro-motility agents, and total number of blood products transfused per patient. Scores were then broken down into three equal groups: low, medium and high. Logistic, Poisson and gamma regression models were used to determine the effects of variability in utilization scores on post-operative outcomes and predictors of increased variability in care between patients.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Predictors of increased cost and length of stay (LOS) following PD included patient age, severity of illness (SOI), and hospitalization at the time of operation. Extreme SOI was predictive of increased utilization of all 8 care variables (p&lt;0.01). Having a high resource utilization score following PD (vs. low) correlated with increased LOS (RR 2.28, 95% CI 2.2-2.3, p&lt;0.01), cost (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.9-2.0, p&lt;0.01), and readmission rate (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.3-1.7, p&lt;0.01). Mortality was unaffected by the degree of variability. While increasing age predicted decreased resource use, predictors of increased resource use included extreme SOI, government vs. private insurance, hospitalization at the time of operation and high volume centers. (Table) 34.6% of patients at high volume centers were classified as extreme SOI compared to 5.8% &amp; 2.6% (p&lt;0.01) at medium and low volume centers, respectively while surgeon volume was not a predictor of variability (p=0.06).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These data demonstrate that there is significant variation in resource utilization between patients undergoing PD. This increased variation is associated with both inferior outcomes and higher costs, which are driven by patient-specific risk factors. Publically available outcome monitoring and reimbursement should consider that much of the variability following complex pancreatic surgery may not be provider-related.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

It is expected that patients with progressively advanced stages will experience shorter survival. We examined how well the AJCC staging system predicted survival for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) research database. In an attempt to account for discrepancies in survival in intermediate stages in SEER data we also investigated the accuracy of clinical nodal staging in resected patients from our institution.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Data were abstracted from SEER Database from 2004-2012 and filtered for PDAC with known stage. The relation between stage and disease-specific survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses. We also evaluated 110 consecutive cases at our facility from 2001-2014 that proceeded to resection without neoadjuvant therapy, comparing differences in clinical and pathological staging.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 44,744 SEER cases met inclusion criteria. Median age was 67 and 51.7% were male. Tumor location was 52% in the head of the pancreas, 12% in the body, and 13% in the tail. Overall, resection was recommended in 25% and performed in 21%. In Stages IB and IIA resection was recommended in 39% and performed in 34% whereas in Stage IIB it was recommended in 73% and performed in 72%. Intermediate stages did not correlate well with the expected inverse relationship between stage and survival. We found longer survival for stage IIB than for stage IB (p&lt;0.0001, log-rank test) and stage IIA (p&lt;0.0001, log-rank test). However, in resected cases with pathological staging the expected inverse relationship between survival and extent of disease was evident (Figure 1). In 110 resected PDAC cases from our institution without neoadjuvant therapy, 89/110 (81%) were classified as N0 by clinical staging, whereas only 33/110 (30%) were N0 by pathological staging (p &lt; 0.0001, Chi Square test). Only 40/110 (36%) were correctly classified for nodal status by clinical staging, with 26/110 (24%) correctly identified as N0 and 14/110 (13%) as N1.  In the incorrectly classified cases, 63/70 (90%) were up-staged from N0 to N1 by pathological staging.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In evaluating AJCC staging of PDAC patients, survival between Stages IB, IIA, and IIB is paradoxical to what would be expected. This is likely due to clinical underestimation of nodal involvement. The high rates of surgical recommendation and resection in Stage IIB patients may reflect stage migration of patients due to unexpected nodal involvement. These findings have implications for treatment decisions in patients with intermediate stage PDAC.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

The comparative overall survival (OS) benefit of thermoablation and resection was tested in patients with small solitary tumors.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients diagnosed with solitary HCC &le; 3 cm between 2004-2012 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) database were stratified by degree of hepatic fibrosis. OS and the prognostic impact of covariates were tested with Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards model results were expressed as hazard ratios (HR) and [95% confidence interval].<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 466 cirrhotic patients (348 thermoablation, 118 resection) and 159 non-cirrhotic patients (74 thermoablation, 85 resection) included for analysis. The median OS after thermoablation and resection was similar (54 vs 50 months, p = 0.36) in cirrhotic patients, and the lack of an OS difference based on treatment persisted in adjusted models. Alpha-fetoprotein elevation (HR: 1.55 [1.03-2.32], p = 0.03) and male gender (HR: 1.62 [1.09-2.42], p = 0.02) were associated with shorter OS. In non-cirrhotics, the median OS after resection was greater than after ablation (87 vs 57 months, p = 0.05, Figure 1), which was reinforced in adjusted models. A subset analysis of very early (&le; 2 cm) tumors in non-cirrhotics also suggested improved survival with resection (p = 0.03).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Cirrhotic patients with small, solitary HCC have equivalent survival if treated with thermoablation or liver resection. However, these results question an ablation-first strategy in non-cirrhotic patients with early HCC, as the survival after hepatectomy was superior in this population. Longer survival was also demonstrated with resection for very early (&le; 2 cm) tumors, which challenges current recommendations.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Current indices, such as ASA or Charlson, fail to account for the importance of functional status. In order to better quantify the impact of frailty on surgical outcomes a  for high-risk procedures, a large national outcomes dataset was reviewed.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Data were obtained from the NSQIP database. Patients who underwent elective high-risk surgical procedures (colectomy, pancreatectomy, gastrectomy, esophagectomy, nephrectomy, lower extremity bypass (LEB), endovascular AAA repair (E-AAA), pulmonary resection, and cardiac procedures) from 2005-2012 were included.  An 11-point frailty index classified patients as non-fraill (0 points), mild frailty (1 point), moderate frailty (2 points), or severe frailty (&ge; 3 points).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 230,212 patients were included. Mean age was 65 years, a majority were male (54%) and white (78%). The most common procedure was colectomy (42%) followed by LEB (25%), gastrectomy (8%), E-AAA (7%), pancreatectomy (7%), cardiac procedures (5%), nephrectomy (3%), pulmonary resection (2%) and esophagectomy (1%). The majority of the patients were mildly frail (34%), followed by non-frail (29%), moderately frail (21%), and severely frail (15%).  Complications occurred in 25% of patients, 40% of these were minor.  Median LOS was 5 days, prolonged LOS (&gt;16 days) occurred in 7.5%, and 30-day mortality was 2%.  On univariate analysis age, race, procedure, gender, and frailty score were significantly different in patients who had complications, prolonged LOS, and or 30-day mortality (p&lt;0.0001). On multivariate logistic regression escalation in frailty was independently associated with complications (mild OR, 1.19 p&lt;0.0001; moderate OR, 1.68 p&lt;0.0001; and severe OR 2.72, p&lt;0.0001), prolonged LOS (mild OR 1.20, p&lt;0.0001; moderate OR 1.73, p&lt;0.0001; and severe OR 3.94, p&lt;0.0001), and 30-day mortality (mild OR 1.68, p&lt;0.0001; moderate OR 2.92, p&lt;0.0001; and severe OR 6.49, p&lt;0.0001). Increasing frailty disproportionately impacted mortality for respective procedures (Figure 1). Colectomy had the highest mortality in severely frail patients (9.36%), followed by esophagectomy (8.2%), pulmonary resection (6.4%), pancreatectomy (5.8%), cardiac procedures (4.4%), gastrectomy (4.3%), nephrectomy (3.32%), E-AAA (2.49%), and LEB (2.41%), (p=0.0001).

Slingluff<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Virginia,Surgery,Charlottesville, VA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can respond dramatically to immune therapy, but biomarkers predicting response remain to be defined. Infiltration by CD8+ T lymphocytes may predict response to immune therapy and improved survival; however, associations between CD8 counts and clinical outcomes vary across studies. We hypothesize that this inconsistency may be explained by differences in tumor sampling methods used for quantifying CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Twenty-four formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were stained for CD8 T cells. Slides were scanned with Leica SCN400 ScanScope and analyzed using automated image analysis software (Leica Digital Image Hub). CD8+ cell counts were assessed using eight different sampling methods. (A) whole tumor, (B) weighted average of high and low TIL density areas, (C) central tumor sampling (CTS), (D) dense lymphoid aggregates (DLA),(E) invasive margin sampling, (F) a random sample of 1 mm diameter (random1), and (G) a random sampling comprising 20% of the tumor area (random20%). We also simulated sampling a 10x1 mm core biopsy (H). Results from the different methods were compared to the whole tumor by paired T-tests. For each method, we also tested whether survival was better for tumors with high CD8+ density (greater than median). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: CD8 counts using F and H methods were not significantly different from whole tumor counts, with differences of  25% (p=0.17) and 8% (p=0.21) respectively. Counts obtained by B-E and G were significantly different from A, by +37% (p=0.0004), -14% (p=0.014), +350% (p&lt;0.0001), +54% (p=0.0025) and -15% (p=0.046) respectively. Only the CTS method (C) yielded CD8 TIL counts significantly associated with overall survival (p=0.038) (figure). Other sampling methods yielded CD8 counts that were not associated with survival.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The distribution of CD8+ TIL is heterogeneous within NSCLC tumors so that different sampling methods yield significantly different results. Interestingly, only CD8 counts obtained by sampling the central tumor tissue were associated with patient outcomes, whereas counts of the whole tumor specimen did not.  This finding suggests that CD8 T cell density within the center of the tumor, rather than at the margins, may be a valuable prognostic biomarker. Further studies with large patient numbers are recommended to validate these findings, and to test whether CD8 T cell counts in the center of the tumor predict response to immune therapy.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Outcomes following laparoscopic resection were compared to open resection.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 242 patients were evaluated, including 42 laparoscopic (LAP) and 200 open resections. There was no difference in utilization of LAP approach amongst institutions (p=0.24).

On univariable analysis, there were a number of perioperative factors associated with utilization of LAP adrenalectomy (Table 1). There was no difference in rates of intraoperative tumor rupture or R0 resection rates. Although there was an association of improved median overall survival in the LAP group on univariable analysis (100 mo. vs 37 mo., p=0.03), after adjusting for age, tumor size, lymphatic invasion and estimated blood loss, there was no difference in overall survival (OR=0.998, p=0.89, CI=0.972 &ndash; 1.025).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Although LAP adrenalectomy was utilized for smaller tumors, there was no association of choice of LAP approach with body mass index, laterality, or functional tumor status.

However, currently there are several factors that are impeding the progress of surgeons succeeding in basic science. We sought to examine the challenges to becoming a successful basic investigator in today's academic surgery environment.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We conducted a survey of all members of the Association for Academic Surgery and Society of University Surgeons via an online survey, which included demographic questions to identify subgroups within the sample population and questions to identify challenges affecting basic science research. Data presented as reporting percentage and statistical analysis by t-test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1033 (41%) members, evenly divided in academic rank responded to the survey; results are accurate within a confidence interval of 95%&plusmn;3% on account of the high response rate. We found 75% of surgeons who do clinical research do not believe that surgeons can be successful as basic scientists, whereas 55% of basic scientists responded this way (p&lt;.05). Interestingly, 66% of chairmen and division chiefs also believe it&#39;s unrealistic for a surgeon to be a successful basic scientist, yet 53% of these surgical leaders indicate that surgical departments conduct too little basic science research. Surgeons most often cited the funding environment and clinical demands as the main impediments to success in basic research. Excessive administrative duties also significantly impact the ability of surgeons to conduct research, which increases with seniority. Mentorship was not identified as a key factor for academic success, although participants reported basic science mentors were more engaged than clinical mentors. Regarding funding sources, there is a perception that basic science is significantly more often supported by the NIH and surgical societies compared to clinical science. The results revealed that 80% of junior faculty conducting clinical research are unfunded, as compared to 50% of their peers in basic science (p&lt;.05). Moreover, 59% of participants reported that the challenging funding environment has no effect on their interest in basic research.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have identified critical barriers confronting surgeons pursuing basic science. These include the difficult funding environment, excessive clinical demands, and perhaps an overall belief that surgeons can't succeed in basic science. The robust response rate to the survey supports the critical nature of this topic. These findings are important for trainees and junior faculty as they consider their career path and to senior faculty exploring strategies to increase interest and participation in basic science. The data suggest there may be an identity crisis among surgeons who have historically often been pushed toward basic research and now find themselves in a new environment where multiple external pressures make that pursuit more challenging.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Although the laparoscopic approach is favored, some authors have raised concerns that conversion to an open surgery results in outcomes that are inferior to both laparoscopic and open procedures.  However, these published reports are limited by small sample sizes and lack of generalizability. Using a large risk-stratified database, this study examines the effect on outcomes of conversion from a minimally invasive to an open procedure for diverticulitis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Adult patients from the 2012-2013 Colectomy-Targeted National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database who underwent elective segmental colectomy for diverticulitis were grouped by completed surgical approach: minimally invasive surgery (MIS), MIS converted to open, and planned open surgery. Multivariable regression methods were utilized to evaluate the effect of conversion on perioperative outcomes.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Among 3,263 patients included, 2,272 (70%) underwent MIS, 276 (8%) had MIS converted to open surgery, and 715 (22%) had planned open surgery.

After adjusting for demographic, clinical, and treatment factors, there were no significant differences in overall complications, postoperative ileus, anastomotic leak, readmission, or reoperation between converted and planned open surgeries. The conversion group had a decrease in length of stay (-0.4 days, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.2) but an increase in wound complications (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.08 &ndash; 2.24) (all p &lt;0.05). MIS was associated with a significant reduction in overall complications (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.38 &ndash; 0.63), ileus (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.28 &ndash; 0.50), readmission (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51 &ndash; 0.99), length of stay (-1.2 days, 95% CI -1.3 to -1.1) and wound complications (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 &ndash; 0.81) when compared to converted procedures (all p&lt;0.05). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Using the most recent NSQIP colorectal database, laparoscopic conversion to open surgery for diverticulitis does not result in worse overall outcomes than a standard open approach.  However, completing the procedure laparoscopically is associated with significant perioperative benefits compared to converted or planned open surgery. This suggests that an attempt at laparoscopic resection should be strongly considered for all patients with diverticular disease.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

We hypothesize that sarcopenia, as measured by preoperative CT scans of the psoas muscle, predicts mortality and morbidity in emergent laparotomy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Institutional NSQIP data were queried for adult patients who underwent open emergency abdominal surgery between 2008 and 2013. Patient demographics, clinical variables, and outcomes were extracted from NSQIP. Patients with abdominal CT scans within 30 days prior to surgery were included and the cross sectional areas of the psoas muscles at vertebral level L4 were summed and normalized by patient height. Patients were assigned to sex-stratified tertiles based on this normalized total psoas area (TPA) for analysis, with the lowest tertile being classified as sarcopenic. Kaplan Meier curves were constructed to compare survival between TPA tertiles. Cox Proportional Hazards models stratified by sex and controlling for ASA score, ascites, International Normalized Ratio (INR), functional dependency and work Relative Value Units as a proxy for surgery complexity were used to evaluate the influence of TPA on postoperative mortality.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: NSQIP revealed 781 patients undergoing emergent open abdominal surgery and 593 of these (75.9%) had appropriate preoperative CT scans. Median patient age was 61 years (IQR 50-72), median TPA was 1719 mm<sup>2</sup> (IQR 1341-2293), and median BMI was 26.7kg/m<sup>2</sup> (22.9-33). Bivariable analysis demonstrated that TPA was significantly associated with total postoperative morbidity (p=0.013), increased length of stay (p&lt;0.0001) and 90-day mortality (p=0.0008) but not 30-day mortality (p=0.26). Kaplan Meier curves demonstrated significantly decreased 90-day survival in lowest TPA tertile. A Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that the impact of TPA was overwhelmed by previously validated predictors of mortality, most notably ASA score.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Sarcopenia, as measured by TPA, is significantly associated with increased 90-day mortality, length of stay, and total morbidity in patients undergoing open emergency abdominal surgery. Since many patients undergoing emergent abdominal surgery have already undergone CT scanning, TPA is readily available to the practicing surgeon at no added risk or cost. As such, sarcopenia is a convenient additional tool for preoperative risk assessment and risk counseling.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

To date, there are no published studies comparing local anesthesia techniques to reduce the incidence of this problem. We sought to determine the effect of direct perineural infiltration to diminish acute and chronic pain following open inguinal hernia repair.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who presented with an inguinal hernia were recruited consecutively from a single general surgeon's clinic and were prospectively randomized to either 1) percutaneous ilioinguinal nerve block, or 2) percutaneous ilioinguinal nerve block with additional perineural infiltration of the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, genitofemoral nerves.

While radiation therapy and tumor burden are positive predictors for arm lymphedema in breast cancer, this has not been as well defined in the melanoma population using large cohorts. The purpose of this study is to identify unique post-operative and surgical risk factors for SLE in patients with regionally metastatic melanoma using the largest cohort to date compiled from a prospectively collected database of melanoma patients following an ALND or ILND. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: From a prospectively collected, IRB-approved database we identified 688 melanoma patients receiving a complete lymphadenectomy (June 2005-June 2015) with 557 patients having either an ALND or ILND. Patients having iliac or bilateral dissections, or pre-op chemotherapy were excluded. Demographic, clinical, and post-op data were reviewed from the electronic medical record (EMR). SLE was defined as being mentioned in more than one post-operative note or a documented referral to the lymphedema clinic. Univariate statistical analysis and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to determine independent post-op and surgical predictors of SLE.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the cohort of 557 melanoma patients, 119 (21.4%) developed SLE following lymph node dissection. The cohort was split between ALND (N=322 (57.8%); 10.9% with SLE) and ILND (N=235 (42.2%); 35.7% with SLE). On univariate logistic regression [Table], having an ILND (OR=4.58; CI: 2.95-7.11), post-operative adjuvant (OR=1.61 CI: 1.07-2.42) or radiation therapy (OR=1.81 CI: 1.02-3.22), and developing non-SLE complications (e.g. hematoma, infection, DVT) (OR=1.84 CI: 1.21-2.80), were each significantly associated with an increased risk of developing SLE. Non-SLE post-op complications increased the risk of SLE only in the first 2 months after surgery (OR=2.25 CI: 1.35-3.74). Use of an energy device during surgery, number of nodes removed, blood loss, and operative times were not significantly associated with risk of SLE. The average post-op time to develop SLE was 103 &plusmn; 126 days and follow-up was 1.9 &plusmn; 2.2 years.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the largest study to date evaluating surgical/post-op risk factors for SLE in melanoma patients after ALND or ILND.

Although adverse bleeding events are associated with all AC, the inability to directly measure the physiologic effect of rivaroxaban in emergent situations has contributed to perceived increased risk and tempered enthusiasm for the drug amongst acute care and emergency physicians. The study objective was to describe a single center experience with trauma and emergency general surgery (EGS) patients taking rivaroxaban and evaluate outcomes compared with patients taking warfarin in this population.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Trauma and EGS patients taking rivaroxaban or warfarin for afib or VTE over a 2yr period at a single quaternary referral center were eligible for inclusion. Rivaroxaban and warfarin patients were matched for injury/illness severity in a 1:2 ratio using propensity score matching. The primary outcome was bleeding complications, defined as hemorrhage from any source during admission or as a presenting problem. Secondary outcomes included invasive interventions, AC reversal, VTE complications, and mortality. Conditional logistic regression determined the association of AC type with bleeding complications, adjusting for age, sex, AC indication, coagulation laboratory values, antiplatelet medications or other AC, comorbidities, renal impairment, and operative intervention. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 192 warfarin patients were matched to 96 rivaroxaban patients (49% EGS, 51% trauma). Groups were well matched with no significant difference in age, sex, admission SBP, admission HR, admission hemoglobin, ISS in trauma patients, or need for ICU admission (p&gt;0.05 for all). There was no difference between rivaroxaban and warfarin groups for bleeding complications (37% vs 39%, p=0.59), VTE complications (4.2% vs 5.7%, p=0.52), or mortality (4.2% vs 5.8%, p=0.60). Fewer rivaroxaban patients underwent surgical or interventional radiology (IR) procedures during admission (32% vs 43%, p=0.03), but there was no difference in surgical or IR procedures for bleeding (10% vs 12% p=0.74). Rivaroxaban patients were less likely to undergo AC reversal (34% vs 46%, p=0.02) or receive multiple reversal agents (20% vs 29%, p=0.04). Regression analysis confirmed AC type was not associated with bleeding complications (rivaroxaban vs warfarin OR 0.83; 95%CI 0.33-2.07, p=0.69).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Bleeding events occur commonly in a moderately ill, matched cohort of trauma and EGS patients using rivaroxaban or warfarin. Reversal of rivaroxaban was less common and intense than for warfarin; despite this, bleeding complications and hemostatic interventions do not appear different between these AC types. A quantitative assay to monitor the effect of these agents may further reduce bleeding events, VTE, and reduce delays in care by guiding reversal and management strategies.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Chamberlain<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Saint Barnabas Medical Center,Surgery,Livingston, NJ, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Gabapentin, an anti-epileptic is currently used for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Opioids are widely used as analgesics to minimize postoperative pain, but their use is associated with various side effects as well as the potential for addiction. The versatility of gabapentin in treating a wide array of pain conditions and its favorable side effect profile has generated interest in its use in preemptive analgesia. This meta-analysis aimed to critically examine the ability of preoperative gabapentin to reduce postoperative opioid use and its' side effects. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A comprehensive literature search of Pub Med, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Review (1966-2015) was performed to identify all randomized control trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy of preoperative gabapentin in reducing postoperative opioid consumption.  Key words searched included combinations of 'preemptive analgesia'  'gabapentin', 'postoperative pain'. Inclusion criteria included: RCTs comparing preoperative gabapentin administration to control which included an assessment of opioid usage in adult patients undergoing elective surgery. Data were extracted on cumulative opioid consumption within the first 24 hours (hrs) postoperative period and the incidence of nausea, vomiting and somnolence. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:16 RCTs involving 1,543 patients were included (770 patients received gabapentin and 773 patients received placebo or no therapy). Opioid consumption was significantly decreased in the gabapentin group (standard mean difference [SMD]: -1.211, 95% CI -1.76 to -0.65; p&lt;0.001) at 24 hrs postoperatively. Subgroup analysis revealed a significant reduction in the morphine (SMD: -0.885, 95% CI: - 1.34 to -0.42;p&lt;0.001), fentanyl (SMD: -2.39, 95% CI: -3.49 to -1.29; p&lt;0.001) and tramadol consumption (SMD: -1.116, 95% CI: -2.05 to -0.22; p&lt;0.05) in the gabapentin group. Preoperative gabapentin had no significant effect on postoperative nausea (RR=1.088; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.34; p=0.44) and vomiting (RR=0.839; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.51; p=0.277). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Preoperative gabapentin administration reduces opioid use in the first 24 hours postoperatively. The decreased need for postoperative opioids with the use of preoperative gabapentin was associated with some increase in postoperative somnolence, but no significant difference in the incidence of nausea and vomiting. Gabapentin is an efficacious adjunct for postoperative analgesia. Additional studies are required to optimize the gabapentin dose and timing.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Two tertiary referral hernia centers conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded trial to investigate the utility of ICG-A in reducing wound complications in complex AWR.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  After IRB approval, all consented patients underwent ICG-A utilizing the SPY Elite device<sup>TM</sup> prior to flap/skin closure after AWR. In the control group, both the Hernia Surgeon and Plastic Surgeon were blinded to ICG-A images. In the experimental group, the surgery team viewed the images and modified tissue flaps if warranted. ICG-A videos were saved and reviewed by independent, blinded surgeons to ensure correct interpretation. Outcomes included medical, surgical and wound complications and reoperation over 3 months. Groups were compared with Chi square and Wilcoxon rank sum analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 95 patients, n=49 control and n=46 experimental, preoperative characteristics were similar: age (58.3vs.56.7years,p=0.4), BMI (34.9vs. 33.6kg/m<sup>2</sup>,p=0.8), tobacco use (8.2%vs. 8.7%,p=0.9), diabetes (30.6%vs.37.0%,p=0.5), and previous hernia repair (71.4%vs.60.9%,p=0.3). The mean hernia defect was 293cm<sup>2</sup> and mesh size 1033cm<sup>2</sup>.

The experimental group was more likely to have skin and subcutaneous flaps modified (37%vs.4.1%,p&lt;0.0001). However, there was no significant difference between control vs. experimental groups in wound infection (10.2%vs.21.7%,p=0.12), skin necrosis (6.1% vs. 2.2%,p=0.3), fat necrosis (10.2% vs. 13.0%,p=0.7), overall wound-related complications (32.7% vs. 37.0%,p=0.7), reoperation rates (14.3%vs. 26.1%,p=0.7), or long-term hernia recurrence (4.1% vs. 2.2%,p=0.6) with mean follow-up of 8.3 months. When limited to significantly at-risk patients (obese, diabetic, concomitant component separation, or panniculectomy), there was no significant difference in wound-related complications between groups. Patients with hypoperfusion on ICG-A (below a threshold of 10 units) had higher rates of wound infection (28%vs.9.4%,p&lt;0.02), however flap modification after viewing images did not improve wound-related complications in these patients (15.6%vs.12.5%,p=0.99).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Though intra-operative ICG-A use during complex AWR may aid in identifying patients at risk of wound infection, it did not decrease wound-related complications or reoperation rates in complex abdominal wall reconstruction.

All patients underwent pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB was performed with intra-operative localisation of the sentinel node with the use of intradermal patent blue dye and a hand-held gamma probe. . Each SLN was serially sectioned then stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis with anti-cytokeratin 20 (anti-CK20) and AE1/AE3 panels.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-three men and nine women underwent SLNB.

Given the high rate of SLNB positivity, we believe that SLNB has an important role in determining the management of the regional lymph node basin in clinically node negative patients. However, the risk of a false negative SLNB is of concern, thus close observation of the regional nodal basins is warranted in patients who have had a negative SLNB.   All of the patients who succumbed to MCC had nodal involvement, emphasising the prognostic implication of regional disease and the need for an effective adjuvant systemic treatment in node positive patients.",,,

We sought to externally validate this nomogram using a multicenter contemporary cohort of patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Clinicopathological, operative, and outcome data were collected on 1,184 patients who underwent liver resection between 2005 and 2015 at two major hepatobiliary centers in the United States and Italy. Factors included in the MSKCC nomogram were number of liver segments resected, concomitant extra-hepatic organ resection, diagnosis of primary liver malignancy, preoperative hemoglobin, and platelet count. The accuracy of the nomogram was assessed using receiving operating characteristic curves and area under the curve (AUC) methodology.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A majority of patients was male (n=693, 58.5%) with a median age of 63.8 years (IQR, 53.3&ndash;71.0).

The median number of resected segments was 3 (IQR, 1&ndash;3) and concomitant extra-hepatic organ resections were performed in 251 (21.2%) patients. On final pathology, 423 (35.7%) of patients had a diagnosis of primary liver malignancy, whereas other patients had secondary liver metastasis (n=566, 47.8%) or benign disease (n=196, 16.5%).

We sought to compare 90-day and one-year outcomes following LSG or LRYGB and identify predictors of &gt;50% excess body weight loss (EBWL) at one year using propensity scoring analysis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Billing data from the University of Wisconsin Hospital were obtained to identify morbidly obese patients who underwent LRYGB or LSG from January 2010 to March 2014. Electronic health record data were reviewed to extract preoperative and postoperative variables, including one-year weight loss and comorbidity resolution. Patient age, sex, comorbidities (coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes and gastroesophageal reflux disease), and surgeon age were hypothesized a priori to be independently associated with type of surgery and were included in a multivariable model to generate a propensity score for each patient. Propensity score-adjusted bivariate odds ratios for variables hypothesized a priori to be independently associated with EBWL &gt;50% were calculated. Variables found to be significant at p&le;0.1 were entered into a propensity score-adjusted multivariable logistic regression model with EBWL &gt;50% as the outcome.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 74 LSG patients and 270 LRYGB patients were included in the study. Preoperative body mass index (BMI) was similar between the cohorts (47.8 kg/m2 for LSG vs 47.0 for LRYGB; p=0.43). LSG patients were more likely to be male (36.5% vs 18.5%; p=0.002), older (mean age of 50.6 vs 47.3; p=0.04) and have coronary artery disease (16.2% vs 5.9%; p=0.01). 90-day complication rates were similar between the two groups (8.1% vs 10.7%; p=0.67). LRYGB was associated with greater one-year postoperative EBWL (61.1% vs 44.3%; p&lt;0.001). Female sex (OR 2.52 [95% CI 1.31-4.84]), the presence of GERD (OR 1.67 [95% CI 0.90-3.08]), surgeon age &gt;40 (OR 2.09 [95% CI 1.11-3.94]), and surgery performed prior to 2013 (OR 6.83 [95% CI 3.69-12.65]), were associated with a higher likelihood of undergoing LRYGB. On propensity score-adjusted multivariable analysis, lower preoperative BMI, absence of type 2 diabetes, and undergoing a LRYGB were associated with EBWL &gt;50% (Table 1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Lower preoperative BMI, the presence of type 2 diabetes, and gastric bypass surgery (compared to sleeve gastrectomy) were independently associated with greater weight loss following bariatric surgery. Incorporating these findings into preoperative discussions may help patients set reasonable postoperative goals.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Variation in procedural costs across the country and within single institutions has pointed out a potential avenue for standardization initiatives aimed at improving quality, value based care. We hypothesized that cost reduction is achievable for laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the implementation of a standardized pick list for disposable surgical equipment.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: De-identified procedural cost and equipment utilization data were collected from the Surgical Profitability Compass Procedure Cost Manager System (The Advisory Board Company, Washington DC) for our health care system for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ICD-9 code 51.23).  A focus group of surgeons designed a standardized equipment list for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and agreed to adhere to this list for all cases as clinically indicated.  The remaining surgeons in the department who also perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy served as controls.  Cost and utilization data were collected for six months prior to and six months following the implementation of this standardized pick-list. All surgeons in the department were aware of this initiative and free to make changes to their pick list regardless of which study group they were in during the time of this evaluation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 281 elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed during the study interval and included in the analysis.  There were 5 (29%) surgeons in the focus group and another 11 who served as controls.  Prior to implementation of the pick list, total disposable supply costs per case were greatest in controls compared to the focus group ($930 versus $801, p&lt;.01).  After implementation of the pick list, the focus group of surgeons demonstrated the greatest reduction in cost savings (37%, $299 savings, p&lt;.01) compared to Controls (33%, $307 savings, p&lt;.01), and supply costs in both study groups decreased significantly. Average case duration and length of hospital did not change in either group. Equipment utilization data demonstrated a discrepancy in surgical equipment used between study groups that persisted even after implementation of the suggested pick list.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Cost savings can be achieved after implementation of a standardized pick list for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.   There was a &lsquo;halo effect' observed in that even for surgeons who were not part of the focus group, significant cost savings were realized during the study time period. This suggests that awareness of the standardized pick list and the measures aimed at cost savings affected clinical practice.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

This study analyzed rates of various types of surgical site infection (SSI) following right-sided colectomy and evaluated the relative benefits and risks of no bowel preparation versus various types of bowel preparation in this clinical setting.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We identified all patients who underwent elective right-sided colectomy and had complete information regarding preoperative bowel preparation in the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database from 2012-2013. Patient/procedure characteristics and outcomes across patients who received no bowel preparation versus various types of bowel preparation, including mechanical bowel preparation (MBP), oral antibiotics (OA), and combined oral antibiotics and mechanical bowel preparation (OA+MBP), were compared using chi square tests/ANOVA. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for SSI were calculated using propensity-adjusted analyses to control for non-random receipt of the various types of bowel preparation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 4,215 patients were included in the analyses (see table). Although a substantial proportion of patients (34.9%) did not receive preoperative bowel preparation, the majority did, including MBP (34.5%), OA (4.3%), or OA+MBP (26.3%). 9.7%, 6.8%, and 3.1% of patients developed any (wound or organ/space) SSI, wound SSI, and organ/space SSI, respectively. On univariate analysis, bowel preparation reduced the risk of any SSI and wound SSI, but not organ/space SSI. After propensity-adjustment, MBP was not associated with a decreased rate of SSI compared to no bowel preparation, whereas OA+MBP was independently associated with a decreased rate of both any SSI and wound SSI. Of note, OA+MBP was associated with a decreased rate of postoperative ileus and was not associated with higher rates of anastomotic leak, cardiac complications, renal complications, mortality, readmission, or longer length of stay (LOS).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Preoperative use of OA+MBP is associated with significantly lower rates of any SSI and wound SSI following elective right-sided colectomy and is not associated with increased rates of other adverse outcomes or longer LOS. Routine bowel preparation using OA+MBP should be strongly considered prior to elective right-sided colectomy.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

With the rise in obesity and aging population, GERD and PEH prevalence is expected to increase. Although less common, achalasia is a progressive disorder that, without surgical or endoscopic intervention, often leads to end stage disease. In patients requiring surgery for these benign foregut diseases, hospital readmission is of concern as it is associated with increased morbidity and poor patient satisfaction, and thus is a focus of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services evaluation of quality of care. The aim of this study was to ascertain the incidence of, reasons for, and risk factors associated with hospital readmission within 30 days of surgery for benign foregut disease.MethodsThis was a retrospective analysis using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2012 and 2013. Patients &ge;18 years of age with a primary diagnosis of GERD, PEH, or achalasia who underwent Nissen fundoplication, PEH repair, or Heller myotomy (either laparoscopic or open) were included in the study. The primary outcome was hospital readmission within 30 days of operation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with hospital readmission.ResultsOf the 9,048 patients included in this study, 511 (5.6%) were readmitted at the median of 11 days (IQR 6-17) post-procedure. The median age of patients was 60 years (IQR 49-70) and the majority were female (66.4%) and white (87.4%). Readmitted patients were more likely to be older (64 vs 60 years, p &lt;0.001), undergo open surgery (12.1% vs 7.0%, p &lt;0.001), and have emergency admission (4.5% vs 1.8%, p &lt;0.001) compared to patients not readmitted. Among the most common reasons for readmission were per os intolerance (23.5%), respiratory complications including pneumonia and pleural effusion (12.2%), abdominal pain (6.2%), and venous thromboembolic events (5.7%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that open surgical approach, prolonged length of stay, chronic steroid use, emergent admission, and pre-discharge complication were most strongly associated with hospital readmission following surgery for benign foregut disease (Table).ConclusionUnderstanding patient factors associated with readmission offers insight into ways to improve patient care in this population. Implementing standardized perioperative strategies such as nutritional counseling, early ambulation, intensive pulmonary toilet, and DVT prophylaxis may help decrease the rates of readmissions and enhance overall quality of care.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

The aims of this study were: 1) To quantify voice changes after thyroid surgery; 2) To correlate the changes to the extent of surgery; 3) To correlate voice changes to intraoperative RLN swelling.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients undergoing total and hemi-thyroidectomy were prospectively recruited from the Monash University Endocrine Surgery Unit between 2010 and 2011. Voice quality was scored subjectively using the 'Voice Disorder Index' (VDI; score 0 to 40, from best to worst) and objectively using the 'Dysphonia Severity Index' (DSI; score -5 to 5, from worst to best), before and after surgery. These assessments were carried out by 2 speech pathologists. Recurrent laryngeal nerve diameter was measured intraoperatively at the commencement and conclusion of the lobectomy, using Vernier calipers with a resolution of 0.1 mm. Statistical methods used included Student's t-test, Chi square, Wilcoxon sign-rank test, and linear regression. Means are reported with standard errors.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 62 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 48 years (range 18 &ndash; 80) and a female preponderance (M 9 : F 53). Overall, the voice quality deteriorated both subjectively (Mean VDI 4.2 &plusmn; 0.7 to 9.4 &plusmn; 1.2, P &lt; 0.001) and objectively (Mean DSI 3.9 &plusmn; 0.3 to 2.8 &plusmn; 0.3, P &lt; 0.001) with thyroid surgery. Patients who underwent either hemi- or total thyroidectomy both reported significant deterioration of voice (Mean VDI 5.4 &plusmn; 1.5 to 7.9 &plusmn; 1.4, P = 0.02 and 3.5 &plusmn; 0.8 to 10.6 &plusmn; 1.9, P &lt; 0.001 respectively). However, on objective assessment, only total thyroidectomy patients showed significant deterioration (Mean DSI 4.0 &plusmn; 0.3 to 2.5 &plusmn; 0.3, P &lt; 0.001). Intraoperatively, the RLN diameter increased by 0.58 &plusmn; 0.05 mm (1.82 &plusmn; 0.05 mm to 2.40 &plusmn; 0.05 mm; P &lt; 0.001). In hemithyroidectomy patients, the degree of nerve swelling correlated to the degree of deterioration in objective voice assessment, in that the greater the increase in RLN diameter, the worse the subjective score (coefficient 2.3 &plusmn; 1.0, P = 0.03). This was not the case in the total thyroidectomy patients.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Voice quality deteriorates with thyroid surgery despite functionally intact RLN.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant factors associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.  A risk stratification score was developed to stratify patients for death and serious morbidity (DSM).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In 456 patients who underwent splenectomy for lymphoid neoplasm, 110(24.1%) experienced a serious post-operative complication, and 11(2.4%) died within 30 days of surgery.

In this study we have evaluated intraoperative and postoperative outcomes of surgery for the most common benign esophageal diseases: para-esophageal hernia (PEH), gastro-esophageal reflux disease and achalasia, and compared the results based on the surgeon's specialty.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a retrospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database (2006-2013). Adult patients (18 years and older) who underwent PEH repair, gastric fundoplication or Heller esophagomyotomy were divided into two groups according to whether the operation was performed by a GS or CTS. A comparison of intraoperative and postoperative outcomes between the groups was conducted. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included overall and serious morbidity, discharge destination and readmission rates (readmission reported from 2011-2013).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the 100,566 operations, 96.48% were performed by GS while only 3.52% were done by CTS. GS performed 96% of PEH repairs, 94% of fundoplications, and 91% of Heller esophagomyotomy (p &lt;0.001). 85.6% of the operations were done via laparoscopic approach. GS performed 86% of their procedures laparoscopically, while CTS used a laparoscopic approach in 65% of cases. Overall, CTS' patients were older and had higher comorbidities (p &lt;0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that mortality, morbidity, readmission and home discharge were comparable between GS and CTS while adjusting for other factors (table). However when each type of surgery was independently evaluated, PEH repair showed higher mortality and serious morbidity when performed by CTS.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The vast majority of esophageal operations for benign disease are performed by GS in the United States, using laparoscopic approach in most cases.  Our overall finding suggests no difference in the overall outcome for patients treated by GS or CTS. Higher mortality and morbidity of PEH repair performed by CTS might be due to factors not measurable with NSQIP dataset (i.e. case complexity).","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Anecdotally, patients are increasingly offered cholecystectomy (CCY) for functional gallbladder disease (FGBD) with a low level of evidence for effectiveness. Our objective was to determine if the rate of CCY for FGBD is increasing and to compare patient characteristics and short term outcomes of patients who underwent CCY for FGBD to patients who underwent CCY for biliary colic (BC). <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All elective CCY were selected from ACS-NSQIP 2005-2013. Non-elective cases and cases with un-related concurrent procedures were excluded. Trends over time of CCY for FGBD were calculated as a proportion of all gallbladder disease (574 &amp; 575) using a Cochran-Armitage test. CCY for FGBD (ICD-9 code 575.8) was compared to CCY to BC (574.2). Rates of readmission were calculated using the person-years method. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used for univariate analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to control for resident involvement, age, gender, BMI, ASA class, and DM and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess adjusted readmission rates.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 163,574 patients undergoing elective CCY 5,161 (3.2%) had a diagnosis of FGBD and 24,810 (15.2%) had a diagnosis of BC. The rate of FGBD as indication for CCY remained stable over time (1.9 in 2005 to 3.0% in 2013, p=0.29). Residents were involved in 53.9% of FGBD vs 72.3% of BC cases (p&lt;0.001). When compared to BC, patients with FGBD were more likely to be &lt;50 years old (63 vs 57%, p&lt;0.001), non-Hispanic white (79 vs 63%, p&lt;0.001), BMI &lt;25 (29 vs 21%, p&lt;0.001), and female (79 vs 77%, p=0.008). Rates of DM, COPD, and CHF were similar in both groups (all p&gt;0.05). Patients with FGBD had shorter LOS (27 vs. 35% LOS &ge;1 day, p&lt;0.001) and fewer major complications (1.2 vs 1.6%, p=0.014). Rates of minor complications (1.3 for FGBD vs 1.4% for BC), return to OR rates (0.6 vs 0.8%), and readmission rates (3.5 vs 4.1% per 30 person days) were not significantly different (all p&gt;0.05). On adjusted analysis only LOS was significantly different between BC and BD (Table 1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: FGBD continues to be an indication for CCY. The patient profile is different from patients with BC. These cases appear to be frequently performed without resident involvement suggesting that this may be a more common indication at non-academic hospitals. While a safe operation overall, the outcomes are comparable to CCY for BC and thus not without risk. Further research to assess the benefits of CCY for FGBD is warranted.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Implant-based BR continues to be the most common (~ 70%). The acellular dermal matrix (ADM) assisted expander-implant method facilitates improved lower pole breast contour, greater tissue expansion and immediate implant-based post-mastectomy reconstruction. A newer technique, known as the inferior de-epithelized flap (IDF) uses autologous tissue to create a dermal sling for the inferior pole of the implant that functions similarly. Benefits of IDF may include a thicker layer of tissue with a natural consistency and better tolerability of post-BR radiation. We hypothesized that ADM and IDF provide comparable aesthetic outcomes, with no difference in complication rates. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An IRB exempt retrospective, single-institution study was performed between July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2014, examining all immediate BR&#39;s using ADM or IDF. Abstracted data included demographics (age, BMI); known risk factors for postoperative morbidity (tobacco, diabetes, pre-BR radiation therapy); and operative characteristics (laterality, duration, cost). Primary outcomes were categorized as clinical (complications requiring surgical intervention postoperatively: hematoma, seroma, partial flap necrosis, tissue expander leakage/exposure, inframammary fold displacement) or aesthetic (five different variables including BR volume, contour, placement, scarring, inframammary fold appearance &ndash; as described by Nguyen et al. Eplasty 2012; 5:486-492). Categorical data were analyzed using Fisher's Exact Test. For continuous variables, the student's t-test was used.

Patients who underwent IDF's had significantly higher BMI&#39;s (32 vs. 25, p&lt;0.01). There were no significant differences in tobacco, diabetes, and pre-BR radiation therapy. Major complication rates were similar between ADM and IDF groups (22% vs. 30%, p=0.34). There were no significant differences in the aesthetic outcomes. Although the unit cost per procedure was comparable, the average IDF procedure took nearly 30 minutes longer per side (192 &plusmn; 45 min. vs. 166 &plusmn; 36 min, p=0.02). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our study demonstrates that there are no significant differences in major complications or aesthetic outcomes between the ADM and IDF approach to immediate BR. However, our data suggests that IDF may be more suitable for patients with ptosis and higher BMI's. On the other hand, ADM is more appropriate for patients with less available autologous tissue. On average, the ADM procedure took significantly less time. Further studies are warranted in this area, focusing on long term outcomes and value-based approaches to BR.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Plastics"

Furthermore, recent studies have suggested opioids are immunosuppressive, potentially resulting in chemoresistance among cancer patients. Opioid analgesics are commonly prescribed following surgery, but few guidelines exist regarding their use. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the patient factors related to prolonged opioid use among a cohort of breast cancer patients undergoing breast reconstruction.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We identified 25,044 women who underwent immediate breast reconstruction between 1/2010-9/2013 using the Truven Health Marketscan&reg; Research Databases, which collect insurance claims data from approximately 50 million individuals in the United States. We specifically examined the effect of patient demographics, comorbidities, co-existing mood disorders, preoperative opioid and benzodiazepine use on postoperative opioid use, controlling for procedure type (autologous vs. prosthesis-based reconstruction) and complications. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess the effects of each predictor on the probability of filling an opioid prescription a) within 6 weeks following surgery, and b) within 3 to 4 months following surgery.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In this cohort, 66% of patients filled opioid prescriptions postoperatively, and 28% continued to fill opioid prescriptions 3 months following the reconstruction. Immediately following surgery, patients who had previously used opioids or benozodiazepines were more likely to fill opioid prescriptions ([OR]: 1.39, p&lt;0.01; OR: 1.77, p&lt;0.01). Opioid use declined with age (44-54 years: OR: 0.74, p&lt;0.01; 55-64 years: OR: 0.66, p&lt;0.01; 65 years and older: OR: 0.5, p&lt;0.01). Protectors against prolonged use included autologous free perforator flap reconstruction (OR: 0.76, p&lt;0.01). Predictors of continued opioid use at 3 months following surgery included preoperative opioid or opioid and benzodiazepine use (OR: 2.45, p&lt;0.01; OR: 3.28, p&lt;0.01), mood disorders (anxiety: OR: 1.20, p&lt;0.01; depression: OR: 1.43, p&lt;0.01), and substance abuse (OR: 1.42, p&lt;0.01).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Opioid use is common following breast reconstruction, and up to 17% of all patients continue to use opioids beyond 90 days postop. Patients with pre-existing mood disorders and those who have previous exposure to opioid and benzodiazepine medications are particularly at risk of prolonged opioid use. Strategies to curb the overutilization of opioid analgesics should focus on identifying vulnerable patients and targeting additional preoperative counseling, alternative pain management techniques, and greater pain surveillance in the postoperative period.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Plastics"

Abdominal perforator flaps have lower donor site morbidity compared to the Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, though complications such as seroma formation, delayed healing, fat necrosis and abdominal wall weakness may still occur. This is the first study to evaluate donor complications based on the type of Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery Perforator (DIEP) surgical procedure and compares unilateral, bilateral and bipedicled breast reconstructions.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective chart review was conducted of all women undergoing rib-preserving abdominal free flap breast reconstruction at a University Hospital between 2008-2015 by a single surgeon. Data were collected on patient demographics, operative details and postoperative complications, with a specific focus on donor site morbidity. Patients who underwent Superficial Inferior Epigastric Artery (SIEA) flaps (n=20) or had incomplete information (n=27) were excluded.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 177 patients identified, a total of 130 patients (73.4%) were included in this study and divided into three groups for comparison: unilateral (n=93), bilateral (n=19) and bipedicled (n=18). Age, smoking history, radiotherapy and chemotherapy exposure were similar across the three groups and did not influence complication risk. Body Mass Index (BMI) was significantly lower in the bipedicled group, as expected (p&lt;0.01, Kruskal-Wallis test). Wound dehiscence was greatest in the unilateral group at 22.6%, compared to 15.8% in the bilateral, and 5.6% in bipedicled group (p=0.23, Chi-squared Test). Seroma rates were highest in the bilateral group at 63.2% versus 48.4% in the unilateral group and 33.3% in the bipedicled group (p=0.19, Chi-squared Test). Fat necrosis occurred in 12.9% of unilateral, 10.5% of bilateral and 0% of the bipedicled reconstructions. Prevalence of abdominal bulge was low in all three groups (&le;6.5%). In univariate analyses and relative to the unipedicled, unilateral group, the overall odds of complication was approximately two-fold higher in the bilateral group (Odds ratio (95% CI): 2.16 (0.66, 7.04)), and almost halved in the bipedicled group (Odds ratio (95% CI):  0.46 (0.17, 1.28)); however these associations had wide confidence intervals and attenuated upon further adjustment. Complications were managed conservatively without recourse to surgery in 68.8%.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: DIEP flap breast reconstruction is still fraught with donor site morbidity although most complications are minor and comprise predominantly seroma, delayed healing and fat necrosis. These are often managed conservatively. While bipedicled DIEPs were reserved for lower BMI patients they, like bilateral breast reconstructions, can be performed safely without undue increase in donor site complications. Our study suggests that the type of DIEP flap does not impact donor site morbidity.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Plastics"

Certainly breast reconstruction is not immune to these factors especially since reconstruction may be considered elective surgery. This study aims to evaluate whether racial disparities exist in breast reconstruction.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of all patients undergoing mastectomy surgery between January 2002 and December 2012 at a single cancer center was performed. Patient demographics were examined, and the rates of breast reconstruction were evaluated in relation to ethnic backgrounds. our minority outreach program was examined to assess the impact and effectiveness in ameliorating the discrepancies in breast reconstruction among different ethnicities.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1387 patients were evaluated during the study period. Overall, 554 patients (39.9%) underwent breast reconstruction with 305 patients (55.1%) undergoing free tissue transfer and 249 patients (44.9%) undergoing implant reconstruction. A total of 444 free flaps were performed for breast reconstruction with 438 breasts reconstructed with implants. The incidence of breast reconstruction increased from 30.5% to 67.3% between the first and second halves of the study period. Although no significant differences were identified in rates of implant-based reconstruction among the ethnic groups, free flap reconstruction increased dramatically. There were significant racial disparities during the first half of the study period with Caucasian (11.0%) and Asian (23.1%) women being more likely to undergo autologous tissue reconstruction compared to African-American (2.7%) or Hispanic (0%) women (p&lt;0.05).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Ethnicity is one of many factors that may impact the decision to undergo breast reconstruction. The previous racial disparities in breast reconstruction have dissipated in the past 5 years with near-equivalent as well as increasing rates of reconstruction across all ethnicities. Community outreach programs may play an important role in increasing the reconstructive rates in certain ethnic groups. Certainly further efforts are necessary to improve upon the delivery of breast reconstruction to all patients regardless of ethnic background.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Plastics"

Although perforator flaps can reduce donor site morbidity in comparison to their muscle flap counterparts for breast reconstruction, they are still associated with considerable, local pain which has recently been the subject of various methods of control, such as TAP blocks. There has hitherto been no study of the pain associated with different perforator flap types. We therefore reviewed Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery Perforator (DIEP) flaps used for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction and compared pain and clinical outcomes based on surgical procedure type: unilateral uni-pedicled, unilateral bi-pedicled and bilateral breast reconstructions.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A 7-year retrospective study (2008-2015) was conducted at a single University Hospital of all women who underwent post-mastectomy DIEP breast reconstruction by as single surgeon using the rib preservation technique for intermammary vessel exposure.

While controversial, these findings have been replicated in multiple case series, but have not been described in a large national dataset. Given its high prevalence in the ABR population, the impact of diabetes on surgical outcomes in ABR is of great interest.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was analyzed from 2008 to 2011. Hospitalizations were analyzed on the basis of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) procedural codes for patients undergoing total mastectomy and immediate ABR with microvascular free tissue transfer. Patients were categorized into one of two cohorts: diabetic and non-diabetic. Data on demographics, comorbidities, systemic complications, and procedural-specific events were extracted using ICD-9 codes and compared via chi-square tests where appropriate. Regression modeling was used to determine odds ratios for complication covariates among the two cohorts. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 36,028 patients met inclusion criteria and 6.7% had diabetes. Patients with diabetes had a greater risk for infection (OR 1.96, CI 1.09-2.01) and post-operative hemorrhage (OR 1.52, CI 1.12-2.06). Similar rates of flap revision, microvascular events, post-operative blood transfusions, and perioperative complications were seen between both cohorts. Patients with diabetes did not have extended hospitalization stays compared with non-diabetic patients. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients with diabetes have similar peri-operative events during ABR and can expect similar outcomes to the general ABR population.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Plastics"

T. Lee<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,Division Of Plastic Surgery,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Preventing free flap loss has historically required intense postoperative monitoring for more than 24 hours in a Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with hourly flap checks and one-to-one nursing; at a cost of thousands of dollars.  Recently, the use of transcutaneous oxygen sensors (Vioptix; Freemont, CA) at our institution has resulted in the earlier detection of free flap issues, decreased flap loss and improved flap salvage when problems are identified. With the implementation of routine continuous flap monitoring on all patients using Vioptix sensors, this study aims to identify whether the postoperative paradigm can safely be changed to permit the earlier transfer of patients from the PACU or ICU, to a standard surgical inpatient unit; with the goal of substantial cost savings without jeopardizing flaps.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All consecutive Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) Flaps performed at a single institution were reviewed. Cases requiring a takeback to the operating room for flap related complications discovered by the Vioptix sensor and physical exam were collected. Data evaluated included patient demographics, the time course of the complication relative to the end of the initial procedure and outcomes like flap loss and salvage. Hourly costs for patient care in the ICU, PACU and surgical inpatient unit were obtained from the hospital financial office.   A cost benefit analysis was performed with the Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over an 11 year span, 1128 DIEP flaps were performed with 56 takebacks occurring. A total of 20 flaps were identified that required a return to the operating room within 24 hours of the original procedure for flap failure. At 14 hours postoperatively, the majority (15/20; 75%) of failing free flaps had been identified and brought back to the OR, with only six other flaps encountering problems between 15 and 24 hours postoperatively. Additional cost analysis revealed that after 14 hours of intensive monitoring, the cost of identifying each individual subsequent failing free flap exceeded the cost of one further hour of intensive monitoring. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The paradigm for postoperative monitoring of free flaps has historically been very intensive and costly. New monitoring techniques for flaps have improved success rates and in an effort to decrease health care expenditures, less stringent monitoring algorithms must be developed. We propose a fast-track pathway for uncomplicated free flaps, reducing the amount of time spent in the intensive monitoring setting from 24 to 14 hours, as patients can be safely transferred to a standard inpatient surgical unit and monitored with continuous oxygen sensor monitoring, with significant cost savings and minimal risk of missing a failing free flap.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Plastics"

It is of importance to surgeons as it is often caused by surgical trauma and can masquerade as a pyogenic disease process requiring debridement and antibiotics. Treatment is however, medical, and delay can lead to significant morbidity. In addition to appropriate treatment of the skin lesions, medical workup for coincident gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, and hematologic has been mandated. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that pediatric PG has differing disease associations and therefore requires a differing medical workup.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) and the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), years 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009, were utilized to identify all hospitalized patients, excluding those with the primary diagnosis of injury or neonatal/maternal disorders. PG patients were identified using ICD-9 diagnosis code 686.01 were divided into adults (&ge;18 years old) and children (&lt;18). For each age group the PG patients were compared to non-PG patients in terms of patients' characteristics and associated diagnosis.  In order to determine if the adult and child associations between PG and associated diagnoses were statistically different, Breslow-Day test for homogeneity of the Odds Ratios was utilized. Evaluated associated diagnoses included malignancy, hematologic malignancy, arteritis, arthropathy, and colitis. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:During the study period, there were 204 / 7,384,591 inpatient children and 10,154 / 89,674,318 inpatient adults with PG. In both age groups, patients were more likely to be female.  In adults but not children patients with PG were majority white. The most common comorbidity was GI in nature, with over a third and quarter of patients affected in children and adults, respectively.  Both adult and pediatric PG patients were more likely to have arteritis, arthropathy, and colitis. PG was associated with hematologic malignancies among the adults but not children. The degree of correlation between PG and associated diagnoses was significantly different between the two age groups; the PG children had a significantly greater odds ratio for having arteritis (28 vs 15.9), arthropathy (15.5 vs 5.3), and colitis (98.8 vs 43.7).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This is the first and largest study of PG in adult and child populations.  It demonstrates the associations currently known regarding other systems and adult PG.  In contrast, pediatric PG is much more highly associated with GI, rheumatologic, and vascular issues than adult PG, and much less likely to be coincident with hematologic malignancy than the general inpatient population.  These differences demonstrate both a need to treat the disease differently in the pediatric population and the possibility that they are differing diseases.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Plastics"

Further complications may result follwing repair such as recurrence, infection and dehiscence. Patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation are particularly prone to such complications as a result of impaired wound healing due to immunosuppressive requirements and comorbid conditions. Numerous techniques and products have been employed in the repair of incisional ventral hernias including the use of synthetic mesh and biologic tissue matrices. Among repair options, biologic tissue matrices are considered advantageous due to their mechanical durability and lower complication profile than synthetic mesh. Strattice&trade; (LifeCell Corporation, Branchburg, N.J.), a porcine-derived non-cross-linked acellular dermal matrix (PADM), shows promise in hernia repair due to its low cost and favorable biomechanical properties. The goal of this study was to compare clinical outcomes of incisional hernia repair in solid organ transplant patients using PADM with human acellular dermal matrix (HADM), Alloderm<sup>&reg;</sup> (LifeCell Corporation, Branchburg, N.J.), and synthetic mesh.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective, single-center review of patients who underwent ventral hernia repair with PADM following pancrease and/or renal transplant at the University of Maryland Medical Center from 2008 to 2012 was conducted. Outcomes examined were: type of repair, post-operative infection, hernia recurrence, mesh removal, and length of follow-up. These results were compared to liver, renal, or pancreas transplant recipients with ventral/incisional hernias repaired with synthetic mesh or HADM at the University of Maryland Medical Center between 2000 and 2005.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 87 patients met study criteria and were evaluated for incidence of wound complications including hernia recurrence, wound infection and mesh removal. Of these, 27 underwent ventral hernia repair with PADM. Only patients with greater than 2 months of follow-up were included in analysis of hernia recurrence (n=15). Thirty-four patients were repaired with HADM and 26 with synthetic mesh, both with a mean follow-up of 26 months. The rate of wound infection in those repaired with PADM, HADM, and synthetic mesh were 14.3%, 14.7%, and 65.4%, respectively. Rates of recurrence were 11.7%, 23.5%, and 76.9%, respectively. Rate of mesh removal was found to be 7.1%, 11.8%, and 69.2%, respectively. These complication rates were significantly lower in patients who received HADM or PADM verses patients repaired with synthetic mesh (P&lt;0.001). There was no statistically significant  difference in the outcomes between HADM and PADM groups.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The use of PADM for incisional hernia repair following solid organ transplant significantly reduces the incidence of hernia recurrence, wound infection, and need for mesh removal compared to synthetic mesh.

Recent studies on human trauma patients have shown that HMGB1 displays proinflammatory cytokine-like properties, being elevated early within 4 h of injury. However, it remains unclear whether HMGB1 surge post-trauma could affect downstream production of inflammatory mediators. We hypothesized that the initial HMGB1 surge post-trauma can be associated with differential downstream immune responses which might drive outcomes in trauma patients. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  From biobank data of 472 trauma survivors, we performed a retrospective case&ndash;control study, where 44 trauma patients (27 males and 17 females; age: 48 &plusmn; 3; ISS: 26.3 &plusmn; 1.7) who went on to develop nosocomial infection (NI) were identified and compared to 44 patients (27 males and 17 females; age: 47.3 &plusmn; 2; ISS: 26.1 &plusmn; 0.9) with no-NI, matched for age, gender, injury severity, and mechanism of injury. Plasma was sampled 3 times within the first 24 h for multiple inflammation biomarkers using Luminex&trade;. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was used at 4&ndash;8, 4&ndash;16, and 4&ndash;24 h intervals to quantify the successive total amount of production of inflammatory mediators. Spearman&#39;s correlation coefficient (cc) was calculated to determine associations between HMGB1 and inflammatory mediators' AUC. Subsequently, we computed the inflammatory mediator rank correlations vs. early HMGB1levels at 4h post-injury. We classified these biomarkers into HMGB1-associated (positive or negative) and HMGB1-disassociated mediators. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Significant differences in ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and days on mechanical ventilation were observed in the NI vs. no-NI patients. Although HMGB1 was elevated at 4h in both sub-groups, the NI patients had significantly higher levels of HMGB1 when compared to no-NI patients. Correlations of the initial HMGB1 surge at 4h post-trauma with the AUC of inflammatory mediators suggested that HMGB1 correlates positively with IL-13 (cc=0.49, P=0.04) and IL-17A (cc=0.52, P=0.03) by 20&ndash;24h post-injury in NI patients. Interestingly, HMGB1 correlated negatively with Eotaxin (cc=-0.94, P=0.02), IL-4 (cc=-0.93, P=0.02), and IL-1RA (cc=-0.89, P=0.03) by 4&ndash;8h post-injury in the no-NI patients. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results suggest that divergent immune events are associated with the initial HMGB1 surge post-trauma. In addition, our analysis implies a key role of downstream mediators of Th2 and Th17 immune responses in patients who follow a complicated clinical course post-trauma.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Recently, expression of the damage associated molecular pattern molecule, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), in platelets has been identified as a critical mediator for thrombosis. Platelet microparticles (MP) are also associated with thrombus formation in many diseases. We now hypothesize that MPs contain HMGB1 and that blocking HMGB1 on MPs using the HMGB1 inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ), will attenuate thrombus formation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  ELISA and FACS were used to test HMGB1 content in MPs from activated human platelets. FACS was also applied to study MP population changes in human trauma patients. To access the ability for CQ to block MP formation and platelet function, FACS, whole blood aggregometer, and flow chamber analysis were used.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:MPs derived from activated platelets were rich in HMGB1 both by ELISA and FACS. HMGB1 expression on trauma patient MPs showed strong intensity compared with isotype (FACS MFI 1105.3&plusmn;72.1 vs 304.2&plusmn;22.1 p&lt;0.01). Human trauma patients had an upregulation of the MP population compared to healthy controls (FACS % 4.4&plusmn;0.6 vs 2.5&plusmn;0.2 p&lt;0.05).

To help enhance our understanding of trauma-related mortality, a number of imaging autopsy (IA) initiatives were conceived, including the postmortem computed tomography ('CATopsy') project at our institution. Though IA is a promising concept, there are few studies describing the correlation between TA and IA findings. Consequently, we set out to improve our understanding of similarities and differences between key findings on TA and IA in a prospective, pathologist/radiologist blinded fashion.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A prospective study of TA versus IA was conducted at an Academic Level I Trauma Center (June 2001 - May 2010). All decedents underwent a postmortem whole-body, non-contrast computed tomography (CT) that was interpreted by an independent/blinded, board-certified radiologist. A blinded, board-certified pathologist then performed TA. Autopsy results were grouped into pre-defined categories of pathologic findings. Categorized findings from TA and IA were compared by determining the degree of agreement (kappa). In addition, chi-square testing was used to detect differences in 'potentially fatal' findings (e.g., aortic trauma, splenic injury, intracranial bleeding, etc) between TA and IA.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-five trauma decedents (19 blunt; 9 female; median age 32.5 years) had a total of 435 unique findings on either IA or TA, grouped into 34 categories. The agreement between IA and TA was worse than what chance would predict (kappa = -0.58). The greatest agreement was seen in injuries involving axial skeleton and intracranial/cranio-facial trauma. Most discrepancies were seen in soft tissue, ectopic air, and 'incidental' categories. Findings determined to be 'potentially fatal' were seen on both TA/IA in 48/435 (11%) instances, 79/435 (18%) on TA only, and 73/435 (17%) on IA only. TA identified more 'potentially fatal' solid organ and heart/great vessel injuries while IA revealed more 'potentially fatal' procedure-related and ectopic air/fluid findings (Figure 1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The current study does not support substitutive use of non-contrast CT-based IA. However, our findings suggest that the two types of post-mortem evaluation may be complementary/synergistic when performed together. Particularly in this cost-conscious era, further research is crucial for identifying applications of IA in medical education and quality improvement in the absence of TA.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

However, the reasons for these disparities are not fully understood. 'Failure to rescue' (FTR), death following a major adverse event (MAE), is a measure that reflects the effectiveness with which healthcare providers respond to patients with MAEs. This study sought to investigate the relationship between racial and economic factors and FTR in EGS patients.  We hypothesized that disparities in EGS outcomes can be partially explained by FTR. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) is the largest all-payer inpatient database in the United States and includes all patients discharged from a stratified sample of 20%. Discharge weights within the NIS permit data to be scaled up to national estimates.We extracted all patients with a primary EGS diagnosis from the NIS (2001-2011) using ICD-9 codes for conditions identified by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST). Patients that developed a MAE (myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, pneumonia, or post-operative hemorrhage) were used to define an 'at-risk' denominator group. Patients with a MAE that subsequently died comprised the numerator and were used to calculate FTR rates for categories based on race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic) and primary payer status (privately insured, public insurance, uninsured). A Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables.  Multivariable logistic regression models were used to adjust odds of MAE and FTR for patient- and hospital-level factors. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A weighted total of 20 million EGS admissions were identified; 2.6 million (13.0%) developed a MAE and 200,000 died, giving an overall FTR rate of 7.7%. In this cohort, Black (adjusted odds ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.08-1.18) and uninsured patients (aOR 1.21, 1.12-1.32) were significantly more likely to die than White patients and those with private insurance.In both the unadjusted and adjusted analyses, Black patients had higher odds of a MAE (14.2% versus 13.3%, p&lt;0.001; adjusted odds ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.25-1.32) but lower odds of FTR (6.9% versus 8.2%, p&lt;0.001; aOR 0.93, 0.89-0.98).Uninsured patients had lower odds of MAE in the unadjusted analysis (6.7% versus 7.9%, p&lt;0.001) but this finding was not significant within a multivariable logistic regression model (adjusted OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.04). Uninsured patients had increased adjusted odds of FTR when compared with privately insured patients (aOR 1.24, 1.12-1.37). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:FTR partially explains worse outcomes for uninsured EGS patients. However, worse outcomes for Black patients are not readily explained by FTR and may instead be related to a higher proportion of MAEs. Further investigation into the causes of these disparities is needed.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

However, the adverse effects of radiation exposure are of specific concern in the pediatric population. It is therefore desirable to explore alternative diagnostic modalities. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are hepatic enzymes, which are elevated in peripheral blood in relation to liver injury. The aim of the present study was to investigate, if normal liver transaminase levels are of value in the decision algorithm in suspected pediatric blunt liver trauma.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Retrospective analysis of consecutively collected data from children (0-17 years) with CT-diagnosed blunt liver trauma, admitted to a single level one trauma centre, between 2000 and 2013. We included patients, who underwent abdominal CT during initial evaluation, and in whom initial AST and/or ALT was measured. Based on local guidelines, we set the threshold for blood AST and ALT level to 50 IU/L.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Sixty consecutive children with liver injury following blunt abdominal trauma were enrolled in the study. All patients with normal AST and/or ALT level were treated conservatively with success. Information on both AST and ALT was available in 47 children. Of these 47 children, three children had both AST and ALT levels equal to or lower than 50 IU/l. These children suffered from grade I liver injuries, and were treated conservatively with no complications. AST and ALT levels showed significant positive correlation to liver injury grades (p=0.002 for AST, and p=0.022 for ALT).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our study indicates that CT might be superfluous in the initial evaluation of hemodynamically stable children with suspected blunt liver injury and blood AST and ALT levels equal to or below 50 IU/L. On the basis of our results, we propose a revised algorithm for management of pediatric blunt liver injury, which includes evaluation of AST and ALT as a screening method to avoid abdominal CT (figure 1).","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Nearly 44% of patients admitted for such injuries sustain another violent injury, i.e. trauma recidivism. Many brief in-hospital interventions focus on young victims of gunshot injuries. We hypothesized that repeat victims of all interpersonal violent injuries are at risk of repeated injury and differ significantly in their demographic profiles. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We analyzed the institutional trauma registry of our urban Level 1 trauma center for all victims of violent injury to identify victims of violent injury such as GSW, SW and assaults. Patients who were injured more than once by a similarly violent mechanism, or trauma recidivists (TR) were identified for further study. A propensity matched control group (matched on age, gender, mechanism of injury and ISS) of those injured only a single time was identified (Non-TR). We captured basic demographics, alcohol (ETOH) and illicit drug abuse. ETOH and drug screen results were compared between TR and those in the propensity matched control group only injured once (non-TRs).  Drug and alcohol screens were also compared among TRs' first and second admissions.    <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Overall (n=410), the mechanisms of injury (GSW, SW and assault) were distributed nearly equally with GSW (38.0%), SW (32%) and assault (30%) across the study population. Victims of SW and assaults were significantly older than GSW victims (GSW: 24.4 (6.4) vs. SW: 34.7 (10.8) vs. 37.6 (11.3), P=0.001). More victims of SW and assaults tested positive for ETOH with higher blood alcohol concentration (BAC) than victims of GSW (SW: 68.0%, mean BAC 82.3 (107.3) vs. assault: 76.2%, mean BAC 125.5 (136.7) vs. GSW: 41.7%, mean BAC 24.5 (56.7), P=0.001). TRs (n=131) demonstrated significantly higher blood alcohol levels and tested positive for alcohol more often than non-TR.  No difference in illicit drug use was identified between TR and non-TR. Among the TR, there was a significant increase in ISS (5.76 (6.5) to 9.28 (13.6), P=0.001) from initial injury to subsequent injury. There was nearly a 2.5-fold increase in mortality between non-TR and TRs' subsequent injuries for all mechanisms of injury studied (3.76% vs 9.03%, 0.041). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:While most brief in-hospital interventions focus on young victims of gunshot violence, a significant proportion of those injured repeatedly by interpersonal violence are injured by other mechanisms such as SW and assault. These victims tend to be older and abuse ETOH. Due to the demonstrated increase in injury severity and increase in mortality across these mechanisms of injury, brief interventions should target all adults who are injured by any violent mechanism with an emphasis on alcohol abuse as a potentially modifiable risk factor for repeat injury.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

However, between 15-25% of patients develop a retained hemothorax requiring a secondary intervention like Video Assisted Thorascopic Surgery (VATS) or additional thoracostomy tube placement. Historically, our secondary intervention rate for retained hemothorax has been 26.7%. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if prophylactic pleural lavage decreases the need for secondary intervention.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An IRB approved, prospective, observational trial of twenty consecutive patients who underwent prophylactic pleural lavage at the time of thoracostomy tube placement was conducted. Patients with hemothorax identified on initial AP supine chest x-ray (CXR) were included. Following standard sterile bedside placement of a 36-French thoracostomy tube the hemothorax was evacuated utilizing a sterile suction catheter advanced into the thoracostomy tube. One liter of warmed sterile saline was instilled into the chest through the thoracostomy tube followed by suction catheter evacuation of fluid. The thoracostomy tube was connected to the sterile drainage atrium and -20cm<sup>2</sup> of suction was applied for 24 hours. Thoracostomy tubes were then managed in accordance with our standard division protocol.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 20 patients 70% were male at median age 35 (IQR 28-54) years, median ISS 13 (IQR 9-18.3), with 55% suffering penetrating trauma. Thirteen (65%) of the patients underwent lavage within 6 hours of trauma with the remainder undergoing lavage within 48 hours. Nineteen of the 20 patients received the full 1,000mL irrigation with an average net return of +26mL. On post-procedure CXR four patients (20%) demonstrated complete resolution of the hemothorax, overall 19 (95%) demonstrated improvement on the immediate post-procedure CXR. Fifty-two percent of the total TT output was collected through the first 24 hours. The secondary intervention rate was 5% with a single patient requiring VATS on post-trauma day zero for retained hemothorax. The average thoracostomy tube duration was 5+/-1 days and median length of stay was 7 days (IQR 5-7). No adverse events related to the pleural lavage were noted.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Prophylactic pleural lavage at the time of thoracostomy tube placement for traumatic hemothorax decreases the rate of secondary intervention for the management of retained hemothorax. Given the possibility of selection bias in this prospective study, a randomized trial investigating the efficacy of prophylactic pleural lavage is warranted.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI), are among the most commonly used in surgical outcomes research. While extensively studied in other areas of elective surgical care, limited assessment of their utility has been conducted for acute care surgery, beyond research in burns and extremity fractures. To that end, the objective of this study was to determine the relative predictive value of CCI vs ECI as comorbidity assessments in models of mortality and major complications for various subsets of acute care surgical patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Five years of data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2007-2011) was queried for adult patients (&ge;18y) with a primary diagnosis of traumatic injury, emergency general surgery (EGS) -- defined by the AAST &ndash; (critical subsets of acute care surgery) or emergent admissions for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and colectomy (major procedures associated with prevalent morbidity/morality). Base multivariable assessment models adjusted for a commonly utilized set of patient- and hospital-related factors, without consideration of comorbidities. Elaboration models considered both CCI and ECI as summary measures as well as by inclusion of individually identified comorbidities. Model discrimination was assessed using concordance (c) statistics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 5,742,935 patient records for acute care surgery were analyzed. Of these, 65.6% had an EGS conditions, 24.6% traumatic injuries, 4.3% underwent emergent CABG repair, 4.3% underwent emergent colectomy, and 1.2% underwent emergent AAA repair. Models comprising of the individual indicators of comorbidities for both Charlson and Elixhauser performed better than the weighted scores for both complications and mortality, for each diagnostic subgroup (Table). Addition of individual Elixhauser indicators of comorbidities considerably improved the discriminative ability of the model at predicting mortality (increase by 1.29% for trauma, 13.10% for AAA, 4.39% for CABG, 4.82% for colectomies &amp; 2.72% for EGS) and complications (increase by 1.31% for trauma, 2.2% for AAA, 0.74% for CABG, 2.23% for colectomies &amp; 3.05% for EGS) compared to the Charlson indicators of comorbidities (p&lt;0.05). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Elixhauser and Charlson's comorbidity indices both displayed good discrimination ability. However individual Elixhauser comorbidity measures performed the best in both morbidity and mortality models.

Borup<sup>1</sup>, R. S. Mangus<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Indiana University School Of Medicine,Surgery/Transplant,Indianapolis, IN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Flushing of the biliary microvasculature at the time of whole organ liver graft procurement appears to be an important component in optimizing blood flow to the biliary system. Two primary preservation solutions are most commonly employed in the United States, University of Wisconsin (UW) and Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate (HTK) solutions. While HTK has a viscosity similar to that of water, UW is much more viscous. It has therefore been proposed that the less viscous HTK provides a better flush of the liver graft at the time of procurement.  This then leads to the question of whether or not this improved flush results in a lower rate of biliary complications in HTK preserved livers, particularly donation after circulatory death (DCD) grafts. The present study evaluates biliary complications in 1527 consecutive liver transplant patients. The primary study variable is the choice of graft preservation solution, UW or HTK. Outcomes include post-transplant biliary complications, as well as graft and patient survival. Measured biliary complications include any need for bile duct imaging, intra- and extra-hepatic stricture formation, and bile duct leak. The secondary outcome was graft survival.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data were extracted retrospectively from a large, single center database covering the period from 2001 to 2014. All primary imaging reports were reviewed. For this study, a patient was considered to have an anastomotic stricture if this is reported, and an intervention (balloon dilation or stent placement) is performed. Patients in whom sphincterotomy alone was performed were not considered to have a stricture. Any leakage of contrast from the biliary system was considered a biliary leak, though most were easily managed with temporary stenting of the duct.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 1527 LTs reviewed, 1360 (89%) with duct-to-duct and 163 (11%) with Roux-Y choledochojejunostomy. Preservation included 1098 HTK (72%) and 429 UW (28%) grafts. One-year graft survival favored HTK preserved livers (88% vs 84%, p=0.02). Any biliary imaging was required for 50% of HTK and 59% of UW LTs (p=0.001). The risk of any leak was higher for UW (18%) versus HTK (7%) (p&lt;0.001). The risk of any stricture was higher for HTK (45% vs 38%, p=0.01), but intrahepatic strictures were more common for UW (5% vs 2%, p=0.001). Among donation after circulatory death (DCD) grafts, there was a higher risk of intrahepatic ischemic-type strictures in UW-preserved grafts (36% vs 8%, p=0.02). Survival at 10-years favored HTK.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:HTK liver graft preservation in deceased donors is associated with better graft survival, less imaging, less risk of biliary leak and intrahepatic stricture, and a lower risk of intrahepatic strictures in DCD grafts.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Study patients were selected from a database of ESLD patients using a stratified study design to include a representative number from a range of age groups and body mass indices (BMI), from both genders, and from a range of model for end-stage liver disease scores (MELD). Controls were selected from the trauma database as patients with an injury severity score less than 10, who received an abdominal CT scan. Cases and controls were matched for age +/- 5 years, gender, and BMI +/- 2.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 90 subjects and 90 controls.

Subgroup analysis of ESLD patients found only a lower albumin level among high MELD patients (&lt;0.001, compared to low MELD). Females had a significantly lower muscle mass and perinephric fat volume, but a higher subcutaneous fat volume when compared to ESLD males. There was a loss of muscle mass and visceral fat with increasing age, while subcutaneous fat was similar among age groups. Finally, ESLD patients with a high BMI had a lesser deficit of muscle mass and subcutaneous and visceral fat when compared to low BMI ESLD patients.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:These results support previous research demonstrating substantial nutritional deficits in ESLD patients that are not adequately measured by laboratory testing. Standard CT scans can be employed to assess the distribution and quantity of nutritional deficits.

However, it is unknown which hospitals are least successful at converting potential donors which is necessary for targeted interventions to increase the donor pool. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine hospital- and patient-level characteristics associated with high transplant donor conversion rates (actual donors/potential donors) after brain death (DBD) in hospitals located in New England.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Data were extracted from the New England Organ Bank (2011-2014) and American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database (2012). Hospitals with &lt; 4 potential DBD were excluded. Conversion rates were calculated for each hospital, which were stratified into high-conversion hospitals (HCH; upper tertile) and low-conversion hospitals (LCH; lower tertile). Hospital- and patient- characteristics were explored using descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact (categorical) and Kruskal-Wallis (continuous) tests with a significance threshold set at p&lt;0.05.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 805 potential donors in 28 hospitals. HCH were more likely to be small (median bed size 194 vs. 337; p=0.02), non-teaching hospitals (90.0% vs. 41.2%; p=0.02), non-trauma center (72.7% vs. 23.5%; p=0.02); but did not differ in terms of rurality (p=0.692), ownership (non-for-profit 72.7% vs. 82.4%; p=0.618), ICU (100% vs. 93.3%; p&gt;0.99) and burn (0.0% vs. 26.7%; p=0.26) services, trauma center level designation (p=0.31), stroke (9.1% vs. 29.4%; p=0.36) and transplant (0.0% vs. 32.3%; p=0.05) center status. There were significant differences in conversion rates between hospitals in different states (p=0.02). The only demographic characteristics that varied between HCHs and LCHs were potential donor race (p&lt;0.01) and mechanism of injury/disease process (p&lt;0.01) (Table 1). In every case, failure to convert potential donors to DBD was due to lack of consent from next-of-kin for a range of reasons, including relatives not wanting to wait or not wanting their surgery for their loved ones, cultural/religious and not being aware of the patient's wishes. However, these reasons did not differ significantly between HCHs and LCHs (p=0.243) (Table 1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is significant variation in donor conversion rates among different hospitals. In particular, a large proportion of potential donors in large regional hospitals are not successfully converted to actual donors. Further work is necessary to determine why conversion rates are lower in large regional hospitals and whether variations in the structure or processes of care are involved.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Unlike HCC, there is no established role for LT in the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC). Though some suggest LT may have acceptable outcomes in highly selected patients, a number of smaller studies have demonstrated high rates of recurrence and worse outcomes after LT for IHC. We examined the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) to compare survival between patients undergoing LT with HCC to those with IHC and mixed HCC-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC/IHC). <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a retrospective review of the NCDB, including all adult patients with a diagnosis of HCC, IHC or mixed HCC/IHC who underwent LT between 1998 and 2012. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared between the three groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare unadjusted overall survival. A cox proportional hazards model was then developed to compare adjusted survival outcomes between groups.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In total, 8,614 subjects were identified who underwent LT: 8,287 (96%) for HCC, 192 (2%) for ICH, and 135 (2%) for mixed HCC/IHC. Significant differences were noted in the baseline characteristics of IHC and HCC patients. In general IHC patients as compared to HCC patients were younger, healthier, had fewer comorbidities and a lesser degree of cirrhosis. The tumors, on the other hand were seen to be more aggressive in IHC versus HCC patients in terms of both size and level of differentiation. There were also notable differences following pathologic examination of the explanted livers, including a higher rate of both lymph node metastases and positive margins among patients with IHC versus HCC. While short-term 30- and 90-day mortality was similar between the three groups (2.8 vs. 4 vs. 3.2% and 4.9 vs. 6.9 vs. 6.5%, respectively), overall survival was significantly shorter for patients with IHC and HCC/IHC. Unadjusted median survival was approximately 144, 48 and 84 months for patients with HCC, IHC and mixed HCC/IHC, respectively (Figure 1). Following multivariable adjustment patients with HCC had significantly better survival outcomes as compared to patients with IHC (HR 1.9, p = 0.028) and mixed HCC/IHC (HR 2.1, p = 0.008). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Given the demand for donor livers, efficient use of this valuable resource is important. Oncologic outcomes following LT for IHC and HCC/IHC are inferior to those observed for HCC, and this suggests that both IHC and HCC/IHC may be best served with non-transplant treatment modalities. Unlike for HCC, where LT is a well established therapeutic option, current data do not support the routine use of LT in IHC.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Fridell<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Indiana University School Of Medicine,Surgery/Transplant,Indianapolis, IN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Gastroparesis (GP) is a chronic disorder of the stomach characterized by a delay in gastric emptying without an identifiable mechanical obstruction.  There is a prevalence of GP among  Type 1 and 2 diabetics of 5% and 1%, respectively. However, chronic abdominal symptoms, similar to GP, have been described in up to 20% of diabetic patients. The present study reviews the clinical outcomes for 526 consecutive pancreas transplants in Type 1 diabetics from 2003 to 2014. This study seeks to establish the prevalence of GP in this population, define management strategies, and assess the impact of GP on post- transplant outcomes. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The medical records for all adult, deceased donor pancreas transplants at a single center were reviewed. Inclusion criteria for this analysis included all transplant recipients undergoing either simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant (SPK), pancreas after kidney transplant (PAK) or pancreas transplant alone (PTA).GP was defined as an abnormal finding on gastric-emptying scintigraphy, other abnormal motility study, or a documented history symptoms for greater than 3 months, consistent with gastroparesis. Primary transplant outcomes included  90-day pancreas allograft loss, 1- and 5-year pancreas allograft and patient survival, causes of allograft loss or death, length of hospital stay and readmissions within 3 months. Pancreas allograft failure was defined by dependence on subcutaneous insulin administration.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 96 of 526 patients (18%) in this sample who were diagnosed with GP or had a history of GP-like symptoms. The GP patients were equally distributed with regard to type of pancreas transplant, race and body mass index. The patients with GP were significantly more likely to be female (p=0.01) and were younger (p=0.05).  Post-transplant, there was no difference between GP and non-GP patients for length of hospital stay, nor for 1-year graft and patient survival.  The GP patients were much more likely to be readmitted in the post-transplant period with nausea and emesis (40% of GP patients compared to 13% of non-GP patients, p&lt;0.001).  There was a dramatic increase in use of promotility agents after transplant related to an institutional desire to optimize gastric emptying and avoid post transplant complications and readmissions. Kaplan-Meier graft survival is similar between the GP and non-GP patients up to 10-years post-transplant (Log rank p=0.78). Long term patient survival was also similar between the groups (Log rank p=0.28), however there were many more early deaths for the GP patients in the 2-4 year post transplant period. There were a total of 16 deaths among the 96 patients with gastroparesis (17%). This compared to an overall death rate among non-GP patients of 14% (58 of 430, p=0.42).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:GP is associated with increased perioperative complications after pancreas transplant. Long term outcomes for pancreas transplant patients with and without gastroparesis are similar.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Klein<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,Transplant Surgery,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  A growing proportion of patients awaiting kidney transplantation are highly sensitized (HS), including the pediatric population.  Recent studies report on the safe and effective use of alemtuzumab as an induction agent in pediatric renal transplantation. Due to the relative naivety of the pediatric immune system, children are theoretically at higher risk for infectious complications following immunosuppression.  In this study, we report on the safe and effective use of desensitization therapy with alemtuzumab induction in highly sensitized pediatric patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   From Jan 2009, 37 pts (Group A:10, Group B: 27) were included. Group A had received IVIg/Rituximab for desensitization. At transplant, Group A received Alemtuzumab (15-30mg,1 dose); Group B received anti-IL-2R. Patients were maintained on CNI/MMF/steroids. Prophylaxis with antifungal (fluconazole for Group A, Nystatin for group B for 1 month), antibacterial for 3 months and antiviral (Valganciclovir for 6 months) was used. Viral monitoring was every 3 months for the 1st year and then every 3-12 months based on serostatus. Blood counts, rejection, graft and patient survival and incidence of all infections were analyzed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1-year patient survival for both groups was 100%.  There was no significant difference in graft survival between both groups, where the Alemtuzumab group had a 90% graft survival (9/10) and the patients receiving anti-IL-2R had an 88% 1-year graft survival (24/27).  Of note, serum creatinine was similar with a mean 1-year creatinine of 1.08 and 1.06 mg/dL in Groups A and B, respectively.  There was a significant different in the rate of acute rejection seen in both groups, where 6 patients receiving Alemtuzumab had biopsy-proven rejection and 5 patients receiving anti-IL-2R induction had rejeciton (p&lt;0.02).  At baseline, both groups had similar white blood cell (WBC) counts; however, there was a statistically significantly lower WBC count at Day 30 post-transplant in patients receiving Alemtuzumab (5.8 vs. 10.1 1000/UL, p&lt;0.01) and at Day 365 (4.7 vs 8.2 1000/UL, p&lt;0.01).  A significant decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) seen at Day 30 (0.2 vs. 3.8 1000/UL, p&lt;0.001) was also noted. Despite the higher incidence of leukopenia, infectious complications were not significant.  Two patients receiving Alemtuzumab had CMV viremia and 1 patient had EBV viremia, but this was not statististically significant compared to the anti-IL-2R group. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  There was no difference in patient and graft survival and renal function in the 2 groups. A higher incidence of rejection was seen in the Alemtuzumab group. Alemtuzumab causes significant suppression of WBC and ALC up to 1 year and 6 months respectively. Despite this, there was no significant difference in bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Alemtuzumab is therefore an effective induction agent in pediatric HS pts and has a comparable safety profile with anti-IL2R given to non HS pts.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

This study aims to delineate the effect of morbid obesity on the hospital costs and resource utilization of kidney transplantation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using a linkage between the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the University Healthsystem Consortium databases, we identified 29,728 RT recipients between 2007-2011 and divided them into two cohorts with BMI&gt;40 (n=747) and BMI 18-39 (n=28,981). The primary outcome was total direct costs incurred during the hospitalization for kidney transplantation which was derived from institution specific Medicare cost-to-charge ratios. Secondary outcomes were hospital and ICU length of stay, post operative complications, and 30 day readmission and their associated costs.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Morbidly obese recipients (BMI&gt;40) were more likely to be female, African American, have a diagnosis of type II diabetes and/or COPD and have a dependent functional status prior to transplantation. No difference in preoperative cardiovascular disease was seen, however a larger proportion of morbidly obese recipients were identified as having either hypertensive or diabetic kidney disease. The direct costs incurred between transplantation to discharge was greater in the morbidly obese cohort ($101,504 vs. $94,606; p&lt;0.01), which may be attributed to a greater ICU and hospital length of stay. On multivariate analysis, morbid obesity was associated with a higher total direct cost (OR 1.083, p&lt;0.01) as well as an increased risk of 30 day readmission (OR 1.234; p&lt;0.03). The cost of these readmissions were also greater in morbidly obese patients ($10,286 vs. $9,405 p=0.01).  No difference was seen in the rate of infectious, neurologic or cardiopulmonary complications.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These data show that despite significant differences in candidate health, morbid obesity does not predispose renal transplant recipients to increased perioperative morbidity, but does increase perioperative hospital costs and resource utilization. These differences should be considered when moving towards value-based reimbursement for medical care.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Whitehead<sup>1</sup>, C. E. Marroquin<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Vermont College Of Medicine,Department Of Transplant Surgery,Burlington, VT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The societal and patient benefit derived from solid organ transplantation continues to be limited by insufficient donor organs. Donors whom prior to death had behavior deemed 'high risk' by the Public Health Service (PHS) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are flagged as having greater potential for transmission of HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C. Public Health Service high-risk (PHSHR) donor organs have been traditionally underutilized due to perception from both providers and patients that they may harbor blood-borne infection with potentially deleterious outcomes, despite evidence showing equivalent patient survival of kidney recipients. It has been previously demonstrated through provider surveys that perception of decreased patient safety remains a barrier to increased utilization. Further data on other abdominal organs (Liver, Pancreas, Kidney-Pancreas), as well as long-term survival data has not yet been published. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a retrospective analysis via the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Database of all adult abdominal transplants (liver, kidney, pancreas) performed from 6/30/2004 until 12/31/2008  (n=89,351) . Primary outcomes analyzed included patient survival at 1, 3, and 5 years, and graft survival at 1 ,3 ,and 5 years.  We then performed multiple logistical regression by organ type, donor age group, and recipient Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: No statistically significant difference in patient or graft survival was noted at one, three, and five year follow up intervals between the PHSHR vs. standard risk groups. This equivalence continued in the logistic regression which stratified by donor age (0-17, 18-34, 35-49, 50-65, and 65+) and recipient PRA at time of transplant (0%, 1-19%, 20-79%, 80%+). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:These UNOS-derived data confirm what previous studies have suggested; utilizing PHSHR donor organs appears to be a safe way of expanding the organ pool as there is no difference in patient or allograft survival at 1, 3, and 5 year follow-up.  These results hold true through multiple logistic regression analysis, stratifying patients by organ type, donor age, and recipient PRA. While the exact transmission rates are not known, the equivalent survival rates between recipients of PHSHR grafts and non-HR graft suggest transmission must not be appreciable as immunosuppression would likely result in a higher mortality for the PHSHR recipient group. These results offer further evidence that patient survival is not compromised by appropriate use of PHSHR allografts to expand the donor pool and are proving to be an important life-saving resource.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

The overall number of TMOTx has been gradually increasing; however, the absolute number remains low compared to single organ transplantation. In the pediatric population, TMOTx constitute only a small fraction of the total pediatric transplants performed. A national database was used to review the overall experience with pediatric TMOTx in the United States.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The United Network of Organ Sharing database was queried through December 31, 2013 for pediatric (&lt;18y) TMOTx. Of the 2340 TMOTx, 247 (11%) were pediatric TMOTx: 187 (76%) were heart-lung transplants, while others included heart-kidney (33, 13%), lung-liver (13, 5%), heart-liver (10, 4%), heart-lung-liver (3, 1%) and lung-kidney (1, 0.4%). TMOTx accounted for 3% (247/8790) of the total pediatric thoracic transplants performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Analysis of outcomes shows that graft survival in combined heart-lung transplants was similar to survival in lung-only transplants (p=0.13), but was worse than in heart-only transplants (p&lt;0.0001). Graft survival for all TMOTx involving heart, except heart-lung, was similar to pediatric heart-only transplant survival. Similarly, graft survival for TMOTx involving lung, except where improved in lung-liver transplants (p=0.02), was not different than lung-only transplant survival.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Thoracic multiorgan transplantation offers a promising option for pediatric patients with multiorgan failure, while combining abdominal organ transplant with heart or lung transplant does not portend a worse outcome.

While they have been traditionally underutilized in general, there has been a clear reluctance to use these organs in the pediatric population. The concern with transmitting these potentially fatal diseases to the immunosuppressed recipient has limited their use. Studies and reports to date do not support these concerns in renal transplant recipients.  Further data on other solid abdominal organs such as liver has not yet been published. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   We performed a retrospective analysis via the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Database of all pediatric renal and hepatic transplants performed from 6/30/2004 until 12/31/2008  (n=591 for renal and n=1311 for hepatic). Primary outcomes analyzed included patient survival at 1, 3, and 5 years, and graft survival at 1, 3, and 5 years. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  There were 576 non-high risk (NHR) and 15 high risk (HR) renal transplants.  There were 1296 NHR hepatic and 15 HR hepatic transplants.  There was no difference in allograft or patient survival in either group.  One, three, and five year renal allograft survival rates for the high risk organs were 93.33, 78.97, and 71.79%, respectively.  One, three, and five year renal allograft survival rates for the normal risk organs were 92.80, 82.47, and 72.59%, respectively.  One, three, and five year hepatic allograft survival rates for the high risk organs were 86.67, 86.67, and 80%, respectively.  One, three, and five year hepatic allograft survival rates for the normal risk organs were 88.79, 83.99, and 82.12%, respectively.  Patient survival rates after renal transplant with high risk organs was 100% in all groups.  One, three, and five year patient survival rates with normal risk organs were 97.87, 97.48, and 96.76%, respectively.  Patient survival rates after hepatic allograft with high risk organs was 93.33% in all groups.  One, three, and five year patient survival rates with normal risk organs were 94.14, 91.84, and 91.04%, respectively.           <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Although customarily underutilized, we have demonstrated equivalent outcomes in both allograft and patient survival at 1, 3, and 5 years when comparing NHR and HR liver and renal transplantation in pediatric patients.  This corroborates data from the adult population and demonstrates a viable mechanism to increase the available organ supply without placing patients at increased risk. This is particularly important for children with end stage liver disease because of their significant waitlist morbidity and mortality.  It is also important for children in need of renal replacement therapy as delays in transplantation can lead to ongoing cardiac morbidity and developmental delays and ultimately affects their overall survival.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

However, there is often minimal variation in the burden of comorbid disease among patients with AAAs. Analytic morphomics is a novel method of risk-stratification that uses cross-sectional images to quantitatively measure domains of patient health. The utility of morphometric measurements as predictors of surgical outcome has been validated in several patient populations. Previously, AAA mortality after open repair has been associated with total psoas area. This study sought to further understand the role of both core muscle size and adiposity on the risk of mortality following open and endovascular AAA repair.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A total of 795 patients underwent open or endovascular AAA repair between 2000 and 2012. 722 patients (91%) had preoperative abdominal CT scans available for analysis. After excluding patients with incomplete medical records, manual chart review was used to identify patient demographics and comorbidities. Validated methods of analytic morphomics, previously described, were used to measure cross-sectional areas and densities of psoas muscle, dorsal (paraspinous) muscle groups and subcutaneous and visceral fat at the vertebral levels T12 through L5. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine which morphometric variables were significant predictors of mortality, controlling for traditional patient factors. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 610 patients were identified; 322 patients underwent open repairs and 288 underwent endovascular repairs between the years 2000 and 2012. Following open repair, overall mortality ranged from 7% at 90 days to 21.1% at 3 years. Following endovascular repair, overall mortality ranged from 4% at 90 days to 21.3% at 3 years. Morphometric variables associated with mortality between 90 and 1095 days included measures of subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and both dorsal muscle group and psoas muscle density and area. After controlling for patient comorbidities and type of repair, a composite score of morphometric variables continued to be highly associated with mortality between 90 days and 1095 days; important variables included subcutaneous fat density at L2 (OR 1.09, p&lt;0.001) and visceral fat density at L3 (OR 1.08, p&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Morphometric measurements of adiposity and muscle mass correlate strongly with intermediate and late-term mortality after both open and endovascular AAA repair. Traditional methods of risk stratification in patients undergoing AAA repair may be augmented using analytic morphomics. These objective measures of frailty may aid in patient decision-making and provide insight into domains of health that clinicians and patients can work to optimize preoperatively in order to maximize positive outcomes for the patient.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

The objective of this study was to analyze patients who underwent open repair with these characteristics and to determine if they had worse outcomes after surgery, justifying a designation of 'unfit.' <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   We utilized the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) database. Data on 2320 open aneurysm repairs between 2003-2013 at 20 VSGNE centers were used.  All aneurysm repairs were included.  Patients were separated into risk factor groups based on the number of 'unfit' risk factors they had.  End points included in-hospital major adverse events.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 2329 patients 15% had 0 risk factors, 34.3% had 1 risk factor, 33.1% had 2 risk factors, 15.3% had 3 risk factors and 2.3% had all four defined risk factors.   Patients with 2 or more risk factors had more post op cardiac complications including:  post op MI (p&lt;.001), dysrhythmia (p=.003), and new CHF (p=.02).  They also had more post operative renal dysfunction (p=.02), higher rate of returning to the OR (p&lt;.001), bowel ischemia (p=.04) and higher in-hospital mortality (p=.01).

Reported outcomes following abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, however, are often based on data supplied by Medicare. We hypothesize that privately insured patients receiving endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) have a different risk factor profile than Medicare patients, and that these differences in risk may influence outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  De-identified regional data including patients in Virginia and West Virginia were provided by the Vascular Quality Initiative. All patients undergoing a first-time aortic endovascular procedure were eligible for inclusion. Analysis was restricted to patients with Medicare or a private payer as their primary insurer. Group differences in categorical variables were tested using Fisher's exact test, and in continuous variables using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Measures of central tendency are presented as medians with interquartile range. Survival was evaluated with Cox proportional hazard models. In a separate analysis, patients were matched using their likelihood of having either payer based upon demographic and pre-procedural clinical variables (propensity matching).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 1,238 patient records available, Medicare and private insurance accounted for 730 (59.0%) and 310 (25.0%) records, respectively. Privately insured patients were younger (68 [13] vs 75 [10] years), had higher BMI (28.0 [6.6] vs 27.2 [6.7]), were more likely to have ever smoked (90% vs 84%, p=0.015), and more likely to have had a prior endovascular intervention (7.7% vs 3.6%, p=0.006). Unadjusted 30-day mortality was 2.4% in the privately insured and 3.3% in Medicare patients (p=0.7). Major morbidity in privately insured and Medicare patients was 8.4% and 11.4% respectively (p=0.2). Length of stay was 55% longer in Medicare patients (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.55, 95% CI 1.35-1.79), and was 20% longer in the unmatched (IRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.42) and matched (IRR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.40) multivariable models. Unadjusted survival hazard ratio is 1.76 (95% CI 1.02-3.02) for Medicare patients, but this effect decreases and becomes non-significant in both adjusted (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.66-2.22) and matched (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.67-2.58) models. Payer status does not predict odds of major morbidity in any model.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Privately insured patients undergoing EVAR are younger but have more risk factors than their Medicare-insured counterparts. In univariate analyses, post-procedural length of stay and mortality hazard are associated with Medicare status. Using multivariable regression alone or with propensity matching to adjust for demographic and clinical variables, there are no clinically or statistically relevant differences in clinical outcomes between these two groups, though length of stay is longer in the Medicare population. Any conclusions drawn from studies on Medicare patients should therefore be applicable to privately insured patients as well.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

After propensity score matching 1:3, the new cohort included 85 subjects for HAAR and 255 for OAAR groups. The OAAR group presented higher rates of cardiac (21% OAAR vs. 5% HAAR; P&lt;0.001) and renal (22% OAAR vs. 2% HAAR, P&lt;0.001) postoperative complications. Postoperative stroke rates were similar between two groups (11% OAAR vs. 12% HAAR, P=0.92).  Hospital length of stay was longer in the OAAR group (14.7 vs. 11 days). Medical/surgical supplies costs were significantly higher for HAAR; however, laboratory and pharmaceutical costs were greater for OAAR. As a result, total hospital costs were not different between two procedures. 30-, 60- and 90-day readmission rates were similar in both groups.6-month survival rates did not differ significantly between two procedures (76% OAAR vs. 70% HAAR, P=0.43). Cox regression analysis showed that renal failure, fluid and electrolyte disorders, alcohol abuse, and surgery performed emergently were independent risk factors for 6-months mortality, and the type of procedure, OAAR or HAAR, was not a factor.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Postoperative outcomes between the OAAR and HAAR were similar, with the exception of lower renal and cardiac complications in the HAAR group. There were no significant differences in 6-month survival between two groups. Fluid and electrolyte disorders, renal failure, alcohol history and emergent nature of the procedure were predictors of 6-months mortality.

Comorbidity-polypharmacy score (CPS) &ndash; a simple sum of pre-existing medical conditions and medications &ndash; has been shown to predict morbidity, mortality, and readmissions in older trauma patients. Our study examines the utility of CPS as a predictor of morbidity, mortality and readmissions in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass. We hypothesize that CPS is predictive in all three domains outlined above.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An IRB-approved, two-institution retrospective study of lower extremity bypass patients was conducted using records between Jan 2008 and Dec 2014. Records for above- and below-knee bypass procedures, including vein and prosthetic grafts, were included. Collected data included demographics, surgery characteristics, complications, hospital lengths of stay, and readmissions (30-, 180-, and 360-day). Comorbidity-polypharmacy score was calculated using patient records and stratified as low (0-14) or high (15 or greater). Univariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with key outcome parameters (mortality, morbidity, and readmission) were performed using SPSS 18 Software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Data are reported as frequencies/mean&plusmn;standard deviation for univariate analyses and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for multivariate outcomes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:248 patients were included in the analysis (43.5% male, mean age 64.27&plusmn;11.79, mean BMI 27.65&plusmn;6.43, 50% above-knee, 94% non-emergent, 65% prosthetic, 79.5% primary). There were 121 patients in 'low CPS' group and 127 patients in the 'high CPS' group. On univariate analyses, CPS was significantly associated with age, BMI, hospital length of stay, 180- and 360-day cumulative readmissions, infection, cardiovascular complications and stroke (Table 1). On multivariate analyses, predictors of stroke included age (OR 1.06, 95%CI 1.014-1.111), CPS (OR 1.080, 1.014-1.0149), and procedure duration (OR 1.010, 1.006-1.014). Independent predictors of cardiovascular complications included CPS (OR 1.065, 1.004-1.128) and longer procedure duration (OR 1.009, 1.002-1.015). Predictors of infection included CPS (OR 1.061, 1.007-1.118) and in-hospital complication (OR 4.427, 1.714-11.435). CPS did not independently predict readmissions or mortality in the patient sample.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Comorbidity-polypharmacy score is an independent predictor of complications in postoperative lower extremity bypass patients. However, it does not independently predict readmissions or mortality. Given these preliminary results in non-trauma CPS application, further research is warranted in this clinically important area.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Outcomes after infrainguinal bypass surgery (IBS) are largely unreported in these patients. In this study, we evaluate 30 day postoperative outcomes after IBS in an exclusive cohort of young and middle aged patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We studied all patients aged 64 years and younger, who underwent IBS in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) from January 2005 to December, 2013. Univariate methods (Chi Square, t-test) were employed to compare patients' demographic and medical characteristics.  Multivariate logistic regression adjusting for patient characteristics was employed to identify predictors of graft failure and death within 30 days of surgery.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 13702 bypasses (Femoral-Popliteal: 61%, Femoral-Tibial: 30%, Popliteal-Tibial: 9%) placed in this cohort with a mean age of 56 (S.D:6.93) years. Approximately 15% (n=1993) of the cohort was younger than 50 years. The majority of patients were male (69%), Caucasian (69%) and hypertensive (78%). Nearly half (44%) of these patients presented with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Autogenous veins (68%) were the predominant conduit utilized vs prosthetics (32%). Early graft failure, mortality and wound infection rates were: 3.6%, 1.1% and 10% respectively. The predictors of early graft failure were age younger than 50 (OR: 1.48; 95%CI: 1.17-1.89; p=0.001), CLI (OR: 1.61; 95%CI: 1.32-1.96; p&lt;0.001), functional dependence (OR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.02-1.79; p=0.037) and distal outflow (OR: 1.48; 95%CI: 1.28-1.70; p&lt;0.001).  There was a 2.3 (OR: 2.34; 95%CI: 1.67-3.30; p&lt;0.001) fold increase in graft failure in patients younger than 50 years presenting with CLI compared to older claudicants. The significant predictors of death were CLI, hypertension, coronary artery disease and dependent functional status (all P&lt;0.05). Complications within 30 days of surgery are shown in Table 1.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have shown early outcomes after IBS in an exclusive cohort of young and middle aged patients.  Younger age is a predictor of early graft failure, suggesting a more aggressive disease course. We recommend extra vigilance in the management of younger patients presenting with CLI in order to improve overall outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Nevertheless, there is concern that high-risk patients may have worse outcomes with general anesthesia compared to local or regional anesthesia.  The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of anesthesia type on postoperative outcomes in a defined group of high risk versus low risk patients.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Data on 11492 CEA's between 2003-2011 at 20 VSGNE centers were used for this study.  Patients were separated into two groups based on anesthesia type, either General  (GA) or Local/regional (LA/RA).  Then using a modified Charlson comorbidity score each patient was further divided into a low risk or high-risk group.  Primary outcomes assessed were post-operative Stroke, MI, Death and combined Stroke/MI/Death.  Regression analysis was used to evaluate differences in primary endpoints for low risk and high-risk patients based on anesthesia type.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  There were 10,279 patients in the GA group (9618 low risk and 661 high-risk) and 1,213 patients in the LA//RA group (1125 low risk and 88 high risk).  The Regional/Local group was older on average 71.0+/-9.7 vs 69.7=/-9.4 (P=0.0095) .  The regional/local group was also more likely to have HTN and diabetes (p&lt;0.05).   There was a higher rate of postoperative MI in the High risk LA/RA then either low risk group or the high risk GA group (3.3%, P=0.0012).  For patients undergoing GA, Charlson Low risk patients have a lower risk of stroke (OR .32, P=0.049) and MI (OR 0.42, P=0.009) then high-risk patients.

Univariate methods (Chi Square, t-test ) were employed to compare patients' demographic and medical characteristics.  Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate time to loss of patency and identify its predictors. Log rank tests were carried out to compute differences in graft survival between both groups. Outcomes were defined and analyzed per societal standards and patients were followed up for a minimum of one year.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 100492 (AVF: 77%; AVG: 23%) vascular conduits placed for hemodialysis access in this cohort. Patients who received AVF vs. AVG were similar about their age (both 61 years), BMI (both 29), prevalence of diabetes (56 vs 58%), hypertension (both 88%) and coronary artery disease (both 21%). Primary patency and primary assisted patency was higher for AVF (table 1). However, secondary patency was similar between the access types. Multivariate cox regression also showed that loss of primary patency (HR: 1.47 95%CI: 1.42-1.51, P&lt;0.001) and primary assisted patency (HR: 1.62 95%CI: 1.57-1.67, P&lt;0.001) was higher for AVG compared to AVF.

However, studies suggest inferior outcomes when RCAVF are placed in diabetic patients. The aim of our study was to assess the rate and time to maturation in patients with and without diabetes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A retrospective review of all RCAVF created at a single institution between January 2011 and July 2014 was performed. Criteria for RCAVF creation included presence of a strong radial pulse and long segment of visible cephalic vein. Variables analyzed included demographic data, presence of diabetes, wrist cephalic vein diameter on preoperative ultrasound, and additional open or endovascular procedures required to achieve maturation. Primary outcome measures included maturation rate and mean time to maturation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher's exact test and Student's t-test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  There were 129 new RCAVF created during the study period. 12 were lost to follow-up and excluded. There were 74 patients in the diabetes group (DM) and 43 patients in the non-diabetes group (NDM). There was no significant difference in male gender (DM 84% vs. NDM 81%, P = 0.80) or cephalic vein diameter at the wrist (DM 2.55 mm vs. NDM 2.62 mm P = 0.76). Overall clinical maturation rate was 76%, functional maturation rate was 68%, and mean days to clinical maturation was 80 (SD +/- 54). The DM group had a higher median age (52 vs. 45 years, P &lt; 0.001) and more DM patients required procedures prior to clinical maturation (12 patients [16%] vs. 1 patient [2%], P = 0.029).

Although more diabetic patients required procedures to achieve maturation, the overall time to maturation was similar in the two groups. RCAVF in diabetics should receive close surveillance and prompt intervention to address barriers to maturation.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

We examined the ability of JX-594-based vaccinia viruses (JXVV) to preferentially replicate in and kill CRLM, and induce immune-mediated tumour cytotoxicity by activation of natural killer (NK) cells.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The vaccinia virus was genetically manipulated to encode for granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (JXVV-GM-CSF-fLuc) and green fluorescent protein (JXVV-GM-CSF-GFP). Viability assays and Enzyme Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay were used to confirm tumour cell killing and production of inflammatory cytokines when CRC cell lines were infected with JXVV. Viral replication was investigated by plaque assay and using a novel ex-vivo &lsquo;tissue core' method from freshly resected liver tissue. Induction of the innate immune response was measured by flow-cytometric analysis of JXVV-treated NK cells from blood, liver and lymph nodes, and anti-tumour cytotoxicity investigated by chromium release.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We demonstrated direct lysis of CRC cell lines by treatment with JXVV, with greater lysis and replication (up to 250-fold) in cells with upregulated surface EGFR. JXVV treatment resulted in substantial expression of GMCSF and induction of inflammatory cytokines within the tumour microenvironment, and inhibition of anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic cytokines. Ex vivo infection of CRLM with JX-594-GFP-GMCSF resulted in tumour-specific GFP and GMCSF expression, which was not seen in normal liver tissue resected around the tumour. Treatment of NK cells with JX-594-GMCSF led to activation, degranulation and increased cytotoxicity against CRC cell targets. This was dependant on Interferon alpha production and the presence of CD14+ve monocytes, which acquired an antigen-presenting phenotype (CD86+veCD11c+veClassIIDR+ve). It was also observed that JX-594-GFP-GMCSF expressed GFP within monocytes, but did not replicate or express transgenes within lymphocytes, further implicating monocytes in JXVV-mediated NK cell activation.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Oncolytic Virotherapy holds promise as a novel treatment modality. Direct tumour-specific lysis and transgene expression and the induction of tumour-specific innate immunity means that it may provide a two-pronged attack against tumour cells whilst sparing normal tissue.","Basic Science",,"Oncology"

Recently, gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel therapy was reported to be superior to gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. However, the tumor resistance to chemotherapy is common and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&kappa;B) plays a key role in attenuation of anti-tumor effect of chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer. We previously reported that nafamostat mesilate, a synthetic serine protease inhibitor, inhibited NF-&kappa;B activation and induced antitumor effects for pancreatic cancer. We hypothesized that nafamostat mesilate downregulates the activity of NF-&kappa;B and improves therapeutic outcome of pancreatic cancer.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In vitro, we assessed NF-&kappa;B activity, cell viability, induction of caspase cascade, and quantification of apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, ASPC-1) in the following five groups: 1) gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, 2) nafamostat mesilate alone, 3) triple combination (gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel and nafamostat mesilate), or 4) vehicle as control. In vivo, we established orthotopic pancreatic cancer model in mice by injection of PANC-1 cells to the pancreas. At six weeks after injection, the animals were treated with nafamostat mesilate 3 times a week (Nafamostat mesilate group), with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel once a week (Chemotherapy group), or with combination of nafamostat mesilate 3 times a week and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel once a week (Triple combination group).

While donation after cardiac death (DCD) has demonstrated significant growth, these organs have inferior outcomes compared to other types of donation.   During the 'agonal period', after life support is discontinued, malperfusion of organs leads to ischemic organ damage.  As a result of the tenet that cardiac death should not be expedited, previous approaches could not be used until after cardiac death and after organ injury.  In contrast to the global withdrawal of life support in DCD, among non-donors end of life care is determined by the family for individual organ systems.  We have designed a dual chamber organ perfusion stent (OPS) to reduce ischemic injury by isolation of the visceral vessels and to perfuse only those organs with oxygenated blood while the heart fails on its own terms.  This differs from all prior strategies because this removable stent would be placed by a needlestick femoral access and would allow the failing heart to continue to perfuse the rest of the body while protecting against ischemic injury of the visceral organs. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Prototype OPS were constructed from commercial stent components and final versions were custom made from nitinol and electrospun polyurethane.   An OPS (n=5) was evaluated in a porcine model compared to non-stented controls.   Paired venous and arterial OPS were deployed.  Next, venous blood from the viscera in the external chamber was oxygenated and cycled to the external chamber of the arterial stent.   Blood from the heart perfused the body through the large central lumen of the arterial OPS.   DCD conditions were simulated for one hour with profound hypotension (SBP &lt; 50 mm Hg).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Invasive cardiac monitoring revealed no significant change in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, mixed venous oxygen, or venous pressure during stent deployment (P&lt; 0.05).  A small decrease was observed in the cardiac output consistent with exclusion of the visceral blood flow.  Visceral blood flow of over 650 mL/min was achieved with the OPS and oxygen pressures were increased nearly 5 fold compared to agonal control animals.   Control organs demonstrated severe malperfusion, contrasting to the well perfused OPS organs.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This pilot study suggests that an OPS offers: 1) rapid endovascular delivery  2) minimal impact on cardiac physiology  3) improved oxygen delivery to organs.   Our early results suggest this novel stent design may increase availability of donor organs without impacting the natural cardiac death of the consented donor. Further development of this approach may ensure that nearly every consented donor successfully donates lifesaving organs.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

Healing requires cell migration, organization of an extracellular matrix (ECM), inflammation, and wound coverage.We have previously shown that Poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) nanofibrous scaffolds enhance cell infiltration in vitro and in vivo in wound healing models, and we have demonstrated that the PLLA scaffold provides adequate strength to serve as a replacement for a full thickness abdominal wall defect in the rat model. Our current study compares aligned and unaligned nanofibrous scaffolds to a commonly used absorbable mesh, Vicryl, and permanent mesh, Gortex. We hypothesized that aligned electrospun PLLA nanofibrous grafts best facilitate native tissue ingrowth, providing physiologic strength necessary for repair of soft tissue defect while serving as a scaffold to guide tissue regeneration.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Abdominal wall defects were created in 72 rats, 6 rats per mesh per time frame, followed by underlay implantation of Vicryl, Gortex, aligned or unaligned PLLA Nanofiber mesh. Abdominal walls were harvested at 2, 12, and 24 weeks. Histopathologic semiquantative analysis was graded for cellular infiltration, multinucleated giant cells (MNG), vascularity, and tissue organization in a blinded fashion by an expert reviewer using a validated scoring system. Mean scores were compared and analyzed with non-parametric Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon testing.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Both aligned PLLA and Vicryl showed improved cellular infiltration at 2 weeks versus unaligned PLLA and Goretex. At 12 weeks, only the aligned PLLA had persistent cellular infiltration of the graft, while both aligned and unaligned PLLA grafts showed the presence of multinucleated giant cells (MNG). The presence of MNG's decreases in the aligned PLLA graft by 24 weeks. There was no significant difference in graft vascularity at any timepoints. Vicryl graft had significant disruption at 2 and 12 weeks resulting in moderately organized connective tissue by the end of the study. Meanwhile, both aligned and unaligned PLLA grafts were broken down with less densely organized connective tissue, or scar.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:PLLA graft maintains structural integrity until at least 12 weeks and exhibits substantial tissue replacement at 24 weeks. Vicryl and PLLA grafts have similar tissue responses; however the Vicryl mesh has substantial degradation at 2 weeks and results in more dense scarring. These results demonstrate that PLLA Nanofiber mesh offers early strength comparable to Gortex but breaks down, replaced with cellular growth creating a favorable option in management of complex surgical wounds or native soft tissue defects.","Basic Science","Developmental Biology/Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering","Pediatrics"

We used the self-assembling peptide Q11 (QQKFQFQFEQQ) and the OT-II antigen from ovalbumin (T cell and B cell epitope)  with either Freund&#39;s adjuvant (inflammatory peptide) or without additional adjuvant (non-inflammatory peptide).  Mice were naive with no specific antibodys to the material or immunized against the peptides to raise strong antibody responses.  Wound healing rates were grossly measured over time in the presence of either the inflammatory or non-inflammatory peptide scaffold (n=20), skin was harvested at various time points for immunohistochemistry (n=18) and lymphocytes isolated for flow cytometry analysis (n=18).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In the presence of equivalent antibody responses immunized mice had faster healing rates when treated with non-inflammatory peptide compared to inflammatory peptide (p&lt;0.05).  The inflammatory peptide treatment had faster healing when mice were not immunized compared to the immunized mice (p&lt;0.05). However the non-inflammatory peptide had no significant difference in healing rates with or without immunization.  Immunohistochemistry demonstrated significantly greater recruitment of CD3+ cells to the wound bed by day 17 when immunized (p&lt;0.01).  With the non-inflammatory peptide treatment, the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ cells isolated from the wound beds decreased by day 10 regardless of antibody response (p&lt;0.05).  Yet inflammatory peptide treatment showed no significant change in CD4+/CD8+ ratio and at day 10 this ratio was significantly higher than that observed with the non-inflammatory peptide.  Additionally cytokine staining of these CD4+ lymphocytes demonstrated higher Th1/Th2 ratio with the inflammatory peptide at all time points compared to the non-inflammatory peptide (p&lt;0.05).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Here we report that immunogenicity of the material itself is not always detrimental for wound healing.  At the cellular level these non-inflammatory peptide nanofibers appear to promote a pro-healing immune phenotype by accelerating the progression of the dominant T cell phenotype from CD4+ to CD8+ cells in the wound and a Th2 slanted response throughout the duration of healing when compared to other immunogenic material.  This elicited immune response by peptide nanofibers may provide a unique opportunity to engage the immune response for a more productive wound healing environment.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

Moving forward, these techniques also hold great promise for the future of cell-based therapies for cancer, HIV and immunodeficient pathology. However, to fully realize the potential of nuclease editing tools, the efficiency and precision of their application must be optimized. The object of this study was to employ non-integrating selection and nuclease-directed homologous recombination to better control the process of genetic modification. The results have immediate application to the creation of animal models of surgical disease. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  CRISPR/Cas9 directed mutagenesis with a single-guide RNA target was designed to target the GGTA1 locus of the porcine genome. A bisistronic vector expressing a single-guide RNA, Cas9 protein, and GFP was employed to increase plasmid-delivered mutational efficiency. Single and double-strand DNA oligonucleotides with a restriction site replacing the start codon were created with variable homology lengths to the mutational event site.  These products were introduced to cells with a constant concentration of CRISPR/cas9 vector. Phenotype-specific mutational efficiency was measured by flow cytometer. Controlled homologous insertion was measured by sanger sequence and restriction enzyme digest.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Bisistronic expression of a fluorescence protein on the Cas9 vector created a non-integrating selection marker. Selection by this marker increased phenotype-silencing mutation rates from 3.5 to 82% (Figure 1A). Cotransfection with homologous DNA oligonucleotides (Figure 1B) increased the aggregate phenotype-silencing mutation rates up to 22% and increased biallelic events (Figure 1C). Single-strand DNA (ssDNA) was twice as efficient as double strand DNA (dsDNA).  Furthermore, these oliogos were able to effect controlled insertion with an efficiency of up to 37%. (Figure 1D-E)<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A non-integrating selection strategy based on bisistronic fluorescence expression can increase the mutational efficiency the CRISPR/Cas9 system by greater than 2,500%. The precision of this system can be increased by the addition of a very short homologous template sequence. Together these strategies may be employed to efficiently control mutational events at unprecedented levels. This system can better utilize the potential of nuclease-mediated genomic editing.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

The pathophysiology of sepsis-induced AKI includes direct inflammatory injury, endothelial cell dysfunction, and apoptosis. Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor-factor VIII (MFG-E8) is a secretory glycoprotein with a known role in the enhancement of apoptotic cell clearance and regulation of inflammation. We hypothesize that MFG-E8 can protect the kidneys from injury caused by sepsis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Sepsis was induced in 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Recombinant mouse MFG-E8 (rmMFG-E8) or PBS (vehicle) was injected intravenously at a dosage of 20 &micro;g/kg body weight at time of CLP (n=4-5 mice/group). After 20 h, serum and renal tissue were harvested for various analyses. The renal injury markers blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were determined by enzymatic and chemical reactions, respectively. The levels of mRNA and protein were measured by real-time qPCR and ELISA, respectively.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: At 20 h after CLP, serum levels of BUN and creatinine were both increased in the vehicle group compared to the sham group (BUN: 39.7 &plusmn; 6.6 vs. 17.3 &plusmn; 1.7 mg/dL; creatinine: 1.5 &plusmn; 0.49 vs. 0.29 &plusmn; 0.03 mg/dL; p&lt;0.05). In contrast, animals treated with rmMFG-E8 had a reduction in BUN and creatinine by 31% and 57%, respectively. Levels of mRNA and protein of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were reduced by 22% and 24%, respectively, in rmMFG-E8-treated mice compared to vehicle mice. The mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-&alpha; were also reduced by 48% in rmMFG-E8-treated mice compared to the vehicle. The mRNA levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), a chemokine, were reduced by 47% in mice treated with rmMFG-E8 compared to the vehicle group. In addition, the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) mRNA was downregulated by 27% in rmMFG-E8-treated mice compared to the vehicle animals (p&lt;0.05).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Treatment with rmMFG-E8 reduces renal tissue injury induced by sepsis through inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as through decreasing the activation of endothelial cells.

We have previously shown that citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) serves as a potential diagnostic biomarker in a mouse model of lethal lipopolysaccharides (LPS) shock. However, it is not clear whether treatment with YW3-56, a specific PAD4 inhibitor, would be beneficial. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that administration of YW3-56 could attenuate LPS-induced CitH3 production, and improve survival.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Three experiments were carried out. In experiment I: HL-60 neutrophilic cells were treated with LPS (1 &micro;g/ml) in the presence or absence of YW3-56 (5 &micro;mol/L) for 6 hours. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were collected and analyzed by Western blots with antibodies against histones CitH3, and H3. The protein bands were quantified by densitometry and expressed as mean values &plusmn; standard error of mean (n=3). Moreover, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown in Transwell&reg; plates and treated with the NETs (10 &micro;g/ml) derived from LPS only or LPS+YW3-56. Cell permeability was assessed by measuring leakage of FITC-labeled dextran. In experiment II, male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to the following three groups with intraperitoneal injection (ip) of different reagents (n=8-10/group): (1) Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 1&micro;l/g mouse body weight), (2) LPS (35 mg/kg) + DMSO, and (3) LPS + YW3-56 (5 mg/kg) dissolved in DMSO (ip, post LPS). Survival was monitored for10 days. In experiment III, mice were subjected to the same treatments as in experiment II, and blood and tissue samples were collected 1 and 3 hours after LPS or YW3-56 treatment. CitH3 and cytokines were measured by Western blot and ELISA, respectively.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: YW3-56 significantly suppressed CitH3 production and NET formation in the HL-60 cells, and decreased cell permeability in the HUVEC compared to LPS only (p=0.015). In an in vivo study, DMSO treatment had no impact on the CitH3 levels in the blood or survival. LPS injection (35 mg/kg, ip) significantly increased the levels of CitH3 in the circulation by 1 hour and was associated with 100% mortality within 2 days. YW3-56 treatment significantly attenuated the CitH3 levels and improved the survival (Figure 1, p&lt;0.0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have demonstrated for the first time that inhibition of PAD4 with YW3-56 can significantly attenuate LPS-induced CitH3 production and improve the survival in a mouse model of lethal endotoxic shock.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

Aspartame (ASP) is a non-nutritive sweetener, used in sugar-free food with the objective of reducing obesity rates. In the gut, it is metabolized into aspartic acid, phenylalanine (PHE) and methanol. PHE inhibits intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), a gut enzyme shown to prevent metabolic syndrome in mice. This led us to hypothesize that the aspartame in diet sodas could be the reason why there is minimal weight loss associated with consumption of sugar-free drinks. This study aimed to assess whether consumption of aspartame could promote the development of metabolic syndrome in mice fed a high fat diet.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  IAP was added to solutions of diet soda and controls of regular soda and water to study the effects of ASP on IAP in vitro. pH settings were adjusted to imitate the different acidic environments along the intestinal canal. IAP activity was measured through pNPP assays after 1-12 hours. For the acute in vivo model, 6 week old C57BL/6 male mice were anesthetized, and a 6 cm closed loop section of the small intestine was created with 2,0 nylons. ASP, PHE or water (controls) was injected in the loops before closing the abdomen. After 3 hours, mice were sacrificed and luminal contents from the loop were harvested and IAP activity was assessed using pNPP assays. The chronic in vivo model used 6 week old C57BL/6 male mice that were fed either a chow or a high fat diet (HFD), along with tap water (controls) or water + ASP (150mg/kg/day) for 18 weeks. Mice were monitored for weight gain, food and water intake. GTT was conducted before sacrifice. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In the in vitro study, IAP activity was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) in solutions containing ASP compared to controls without ASP at pH 3-6. In the bowel loop model, IAP activity was significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced in mice that received ASP compared to controls. At 18 weeks of the chronic study, mice in the HFD+ASP group had gained more weight compared to HFD+water group (42.38&plusmn;3.12 vs 48.05&plusmn;1.61; p=0.0001). Glucose levels were significantly higher in the HFD+ASP group after 16 hours of fasting (p=0.02), and in both ASP groups after 6 hours of fasting (p=0.02 and p=0.006 respectively). Although no significance was reached, a trend was seen indicating that mice receiving ASP had lower luminal IAP activity compared to the controls (p=0.07). Serum TNF-alpha was increased in both ASP groups (p=0.005), and was highest in HFD+ASP (p=0.01), indicating higher level of inflammation in groups receiving ASP. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: IAP has been proven to halt the inflammatory changes leading to the metabolic syndrome caused by the increase in endotoxin levels (LPS) associated with a high fat diet. This protective effect by IAP could be inhibited by phenylalanine &ndash; one of aspartame's metabolites &ndash; perhaps explaining the observation that diet drinks are not associated with the weight loss that people expect.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

Its efficacy, however, is limited by a potential immune response against transgene encoded neoantigens and the consequent diminution of therapeutic protein levels.  Prior studies have shown that neonatal exposure to recombinant viral vector and transgene proteins can result in immunologic tolerance and persistent transgene expression.  In this study we sought to determine if central tolerance plays a role in the mechanism of neonatal tolerance via thymic deletion.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) was developed that expressed secreted ovalbumin (OVA) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) and was administered to C57BL/6 pups at birth; control mice received no virus.  OVA and anti-OVA levels were serially obtained for over 1 year.  Vaccination with OVA administered subcutaneously was performed.  At 6 weeks and 1 year euthanasia was performed and viral DNA was quantified using qPCR.  OT-2 mice that express CD4+ transgenic T cell receptors specific for OVA peptide received either no virus at birth or were administered AAV-OVA.  OT-2 mice crossed with transgenic mice expressing membrane bound chicken ovalbumin on all cells (CAG-OVA) were injected with AAV-OVA neonatally.  Thymi were removed for flow cytometry analysis as adults.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A single intravenous dose of AAV administered to C57BL/6 pups led to life-long expression of ovalbumin in wild type mice (&gt;1 year) without a humoral immune response; this persisted after vaccination with adjuvant.  Quantitative PCR revealed that the highest viral copy number levels after 1 year were expressed in the liver.  OT-2 mice that received no injection were found to have 81.3% CD4+ thymocytes when examined as adults, while OT-2 mice crossed with CAG-OVA mice were found to have 10.1% of their thymocytes CD4+.  OT-2 mice administered AAV-OVA at birth demonstrated 69.6% of their thymocytes as CD4+ (p=0.01 compared to OT-2). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These studies show that neonatally administered AAV-OVA in C57BL/6 mice results in long term protein expression and tolerance to OVA.  After vaccination challenge with a purified OVA protein, serum OVA levels persisted without significant humoral response.  In order to better understand if central tolerance plays a role in this mechanism of neonatal tolerance, thymic subpopulations of OT2 transgenic mice that received no virus at birth were compared to OT2 mice crossed with CAG-OVA mice (allowing the earliest post-conception exposure to membrane-bound OVA).  There was significant reduction of CD4+ positive cells (81.3% vs. 10.1%, p &lt;0.001) suggesting that early exposure to OVA led to negative selection during immunologic ontogeny.  However, OT2 mice that received neonatally administered AAV-OVA demonstrated 69.6% CD4+ thymocytes as adults, suggesting that thymic deletion has little if any role in the mechanism of neonatal tolerance.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

Kennedy<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin,School Of Medicine And Public Health, Department Of Surgery,Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Notch signaling is a critical pathway in determination of cell fate in various tissues, specifically in the context of inflammation.  A recent study in our lab revealed that Notch signaling is essential for generation of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) producing interleukin (IL)-22, which protect the intestinal mucosa from infection. Interestingly, induction of the Notch signaling pathway and subsequent production of IL-22 was found to be dependent on the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).  Because the AHR is well characterized in liver inflammation, we hypothesize that Notch gene activation in the liver is driven by AHR expression.  To examine our hypothesis, we investigated (1) which Notch isoform (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Notch4) is regulated by AHR and (2) whether the Notch gene is controlled by canonical or non-canonical AHR signaling pathway.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: To examine the AHR-dependency on the regulation of Notch genes, we used hepatocyte-specific AHR deletion mice. Mice were injected with a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (64-100 &mu;g/kg total body weight) dissolved in DMSO, or DMSO alone. 5-7 days after the single i.p. injection, mice were sacrificed and liver samples were removed for total RNA extraction. We then measured gene expression of Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4 by qualitative rt-PCR. To determine if Notch gene induction occurs through canonical or non-canonical AHR signaling, we used hepatocyte-specific AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) and AHR-interaction protein (AIP) deletion mouse models.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In mouse livers of wild-type (WT, C57BL/6) mice, the expression of Notch1 gene was significantly increased (8 fold, p&lt;0.05) by TCDD, while Notch2, Notch3 and Notch4 were not significantly induced (Notch2; p=0.605, Notch4; p=0.252, and Notch3 was not detectable.). The Notch1 gene induction by TCDD is not observed in hepatocyte-specific AHR deletion mice. In addition, the increase of Notch 1 expression was not detected in both hepatocyte-specific AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) and AHR-interaction protein (AIP) deletion mouse models.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our results suggest that the mouse Notch1 gene is a novel AHR-driven gene that acts through the canonical AHR signaling pathway.  Notch1 gene expression is significantly induced in the liver by TCDD treatment in wild-type controls of all three mouse lines (AHR, Arnt, and Ara9 deletion models), while its expression cannot be induced in the absence of these canonical AHR pathway genes.  In the context of human disease, Notch1 activity is important in the maintenance of hepatocyte homeostasis and irregular Notch signaling is most likely implicated in liver inflammation.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","General Surgery"

Levels of cfDNA are increased in the serum of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients, and increasing evidence shows cfDNA may play a role in mediating disease progression. Degradation of cfDNA using DNase I reduces pancreatic cancer cell invasion in vitro and reduces metastasis in a PC mouse model. These data indicate that cfDNA is more than a biomarker and may also be a target for therapy. For this purpose, we propose to use nucleic acid binding polymers (NABPs) as a more clinically feasible approach to reverse the effects of cfDNA. Our lab has previously demonstrated that NABPs can bind and reverse the effects of cfDNA in vitro and improve outcomes in various inflammatory conditions. Our hypothesis is that cfDNA will increase PC cell invasion in vitro, and that NABPs can 'scavenge' cfDNA and block this effect.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Human PC cell lines Panc-1 and BxPC-3 were used for the following experiments. Cells were seeded in serum-free media onto a Matrigel-coated Transwell membrane with 8&mu;m pores and allowed to invade for 24hr. Invaded cells were fixed, stained with 5% crystal violet, and the average number of invaded cells per image was counted. We examined the effects that various cfDNA sources had on invasion and investigated the co-administration of PAMAM-G3, a commercially available NABP, to assess its potential as a therapeutic agent.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: CpG ODN 2006 (4&mu;M), a synthetic unmethylated DNA oligonucleotide, potently stimulates Panc-1 and BxPC-3 invasion. Sources of DNA in the serum of PC patients include direct secretion from immune cells, or release from dying cancer cells. To emulate these settings, we investigated naturally occurring sources of cfDNA and found that conditioned media (CM) containing high levels of cfDNA released from irradiated PC cells stimulate BxPC-3 invasion. PAMAM-G3 (20&mu;g/mL) blocks the effects of both CpG and endogenous cfDNA from CM and reduces PC cell invasion back to baseline levels (Fig A).  In a separate experiment, purified mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which contains a higher proportion of unmethylated CpG sequences than genomic DNA, also stimulates PC cell invasion at 20&mu;g/mL and may be the component of cfDNA that is mediating this effect (Fig B).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: CfDNA-containing media and purified mtDNA stimulate PC cell invasion in vitro, and the effects of cfDNA can be blocked by PAMAM-G3.

Epidemiological studies suggest that green tea consumption is associated with lower incidence of liver disease. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a polyphenol found in green tea that abrogates hepatic fibrosis. Our previous results show that EGCG reduces OPN protein expression by increasing mRNA degradation. EGCG upregulates expression of multiple miRNAs in HepG2 cells, including miRNA 221. In Silico analysis identified the 3'UTR of OPN mRNA as a potential target for miRNA 221. Since miRNA expression varied depending on EGCG treatment protocols, we also identified miRNA 181a and 10b as candidates. We investigated whether these miRNAs mediate EGCG dependent OPN mRNA decay and their role both in vitro using HepG2 cells and in vivo using a rat model of thioacetamide (TAA) liver injury and fibrosis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  HepG2 cells were treated with EGCG [0.02-20&micro;g/ml], and real time-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to quantify miRNA expression. Antagomirs and mimics were transfected. OPN protein was quantified by ELISA. MicroRNA was extracted from rat liver tissue and quantified by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed for trichrome, p53, ki67, and OPN. IHC profiler was used to analyze OPN staining.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: EGCG treatment [0.02-20 &micro;g/ml] of HepG2 cells increased expression of miRNAs 221, 181a, and 10b (p&lt;0.05), with 221 having the highest expression. 2&micro;g/ml of EGCG was chosen for downstream experiments because it is physiologically relevant. 2&micro;g/ml EGCG decreased OPN protein levels by ~0.6 fold (p&lt;0.01) while antagomir inhibition of only miRNA 221 reversed this effect (p&lt;0.01). However, all three mimic miRNAs caused a ~0.6-fold decrease in OPN protein levels (p&lt;0.01). Hepatic tissue from TAA rats treated with EGCG had upregulated expression of all three miRNAs (p&lt;0.05). IHC analysis showed that TAA treated rats developed mild to moderate steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Rats simultaneously treated with EGCG showed no signs of liver damage. TAA rats had increased expression of ki67, p53, and OPN, indicating increased hepatocyte proliferation, apoptosis, and fibrosis, respectively, while EGCG+TAA rats did not have increased expression. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In in vitro and in vivo models of TAA induced hepatocyte injury, EGCG inhibits OPN dependent injury and fibrosis by primarily upregulating miRNA221 to accelerate OPN degradation.

CS-1 monolayers treated with these regimens were harvested at 30hrs for cell cycle analysis or inoculation into Nu/J mice (n=7/group) to assess differences in tumor volume and disease-free survival (DFS).                                                                                                                                                        <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Treatment with 1000nM pax for both 4hr pulse dose and 30hr continuous incubation in vitro induced a predominant G2/M peak on flow cytometric analysis by 30hrs, with a decline in p53 expression below control levels.  In contrast, cell cycle profiles and p53 levels in the 10nM group remained similar to controls even after 30hrs.  When treated monolayers were harvested at 30hrs and injected in vivo, treatment with 1000nM Pax resulted in improved DFS with both treatment durations (fig). The 4hr and 30hr 1000nM Pax-treated groups showed statistically significant reductions in measured tumor volume at 28 days post-treatment compared to 10nM groups treated for the equivalent duration (p=0.01 and p=0.007, respectively).                              <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: CS-1 monolayers exposed to 1000nM Pax, as demonstrated during Pax film treatment in vivo, undergo a G2/M arrest that correlates with significantly reduced in vivo tumor growth and improved DFS.  In contrast, monolayers treated with 10nM Pax, as demonstrated following systemic Pax in vivo, appear relatively resistant to G2/M accumulation, or 'escape' from mitotic arrest, resulting in inferior DFS.  Cell death during a p53-independent G2/M arrest, with microtubule damage and mitochondrial collapse, is a hallmark of cytotoxicity at high Pax concentrations but both dose and duration appear important for improved efficacy as achieved by polymer films in vivo compared to equivalent bolus dose Pax given systemically.","Basic Science","Experimental Therapeutics/Other","Cross Disciplinary"

After being subjected to 70% hepatectomy they were necropsied and liver samples were evaluated with the use of immunohistochemistry, western blot assay, and liver EchoMRI.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Resveratrol was found to induce liver EGFR mRNA, protein, and phosphorylation of EGFR.  Resveratrol increased PCNA levels without increasing liver mass, due to concomitant reduction in hepatic lipid content.  Resveratrol did not increase serum ALT, AST, or bilirubin in normal or obese mice.  Resveratrol ameliorates liver injury and accelerated regeneration after partial hepatectomy, while reducing macrosteatosis and presence of apoptotic hepatocytes.  Resveratrol reduced mortality in obese mice that underwent extended 80% hepatectomy.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Resveratrol increases EGFR expression, decreases hepatic lipid content, and promotes hepatocyte proliferation and recovery after hepatectomy.

Yoo<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Tufts Medical Center,Colon And Rectal Surgery,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory enteropathy characterized by the presence of fibrotic strictures. Myofibroblasts (MFB) are stromal cells of the GI tract that are found in increased numbers in the lamina propria of patients with CD and represent the key effector cells involved in pathologic fibrosis during chronic inflammation.  MFB are a known target of TNF-&alpha;, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of CD. However, the precise mechanisms through which TNF-&alpha; contributes to fibrosis remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TNF-&alpha; increases MFB-induced collagen production and MFB migration through the COX-2 and Hsp27 pathways.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The human colonic MFB cell line 18Co was grown to confluence on 35x10mm cell culture dishes and was used from passages 8-14. An in vitro wound-healing assay was used to assess the effect of TNF-&alpha;  (12 ng/ml) on MFB migration over a period of 24 hours in the presence or absence of several inhibitors (NS398 (10 &mu;M) and SB203580(10 &mu;M)). Hsp27 siRNA was used to block the expression of Hsp27 in the 18Co cells, and to evaluate the influence of Hsp27 on colonic MFB migration. Antibodies to collagen (COL1A2), pHsp27, and COX-2 were used to evaluate their expression levels using western blotting.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Exposure of 18Co cells to TNF-&alpha; increased collagen type I expression in a time-dependent fashion and increased MFB migration over 24 hrs. Incubation of 18Co cells with TNF-&alpha; for 4 hours also led to the increased expression of COX-2 and stimulated rapid phosphorylation of Hsp27 at Ser82. TNF-&alpha;-mediated expression of COX-2 and phosphorylation of Hsp27 were both inhibited by the P38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. TNF- &alpha;-induced MFB migration was significantly inhibited by SB203580 (p&lt;0.05), as well as NS398 (p&lt;0.05), a direct inhibitor of COX-2. Hsp27 siRNA was effective in blocking the expression of Hsp27, and also inhibited MFB migration.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:TNF-&alpha; increases collagen production and stimulates cell migration in human colonic myofibroblasts through P38 MAPK-mediated activation of COX-2 and Hsp27. Both COX-2 and Hsp27 appear to regulate myofibroblast cell migration, which may play an important role in mucosal healing in the setting of inflammation. Further elucidating these inflammatory signaling pathways may lead to novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of Crohn's related fibrosis and strictures.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","General Surgery"

Luminal omega-3 fatty acid (OM-3) reduces inflammation and may have a growth factor-like effect on small intestine (SI). However, there are few studies that have investigated the effects of OM-3 on bowel adaptation after MSBR. This study was designed to evaluate OM-3 alone and in combination with GLP-2, to determine a potential synergistic effect on intestinal growth and function using a rat model of intestinal failure.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: 60 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 80% MSBR and were divided into 4 groups (N=15/group): Group 1: IV Saline (Control)+regular feeds; Group 2: IV GLP-2+regular feeds; Group 3: IV Saline+OM-3 enriched feeds; and Group 4: IV GLP-2+OM-3 enriched feeds(GO). 5 animals per group were sacrificed at 7, 14, and 28 days. SI mucosa was harvested. DNA and protein content were measured as markers of mucosal mass. Galactose and Glycine absorption were measured in a 10 cm segment of remaining SI using an in-vivo closed, recirculation technique at 28 days. Statistical analysis was done by ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:7 Days: DNA was increased in all treatment groups compared to control(p&lt;0.05) but not when compared to each other. Protein was increased in all treatment groups compared to control(p&lt;0.05). Both OM-3 and GO groups had increased protein compared to GLP-2 only group(p&lt;0.05) but not compared to each other.14 days: OM-3 and GO groups had increased DNA compared to control(p&lt;0.05). Both OM-3 and GO groups had increased DNA compared to GLP-2 group (p&lt;0.001) but not compared to each other. Protein was increased in all treatment groups compared to control(p&lt;0.05). The OM-3 group had increased protein compared to the GLP-2 group(p&lt;0.05), but GO group did not have increased protein compared to GLP-2 or OM-3 groups(p&gt;0.05). 28 days: DNA was increased in all treatment groups compared to control(p&lt;0.05). Both OM-3 and GO groups had increased DNA compared to GLP-2 group(p&lt;0.005) but not compared to each other. The OM-3 and GLP-2 groups had increased protein when compared to control(p&lt;0.05) and each other (p&lt;0.005). All treatment groups had increased galactose and glycine absorption compared to the control group(p&lt;0.005) but not compared to each other (Fig. 1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Individually, GLP-2 and OM-3 are very effective in enhancing the adaptive process by increasing mucosal mass and function, at all three time points. More importantly clinically, GLP-2 and OM-3 increase substrate absorption in a rat model of intestinal failure.

We sought to identify possible genes involved in diverticulitis by performing RNA-Seq on a group of youthful surgical diverticulitis patients with a positive family history (FD) compared to 1) a group of typical elderly diverticulitis patients (ED) without family history and 2) control patients without evidence of diverticulosis (C).   <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The FD group consisted of five surgically managed patients under the age of 50 (mean age 46, 3M/2F) each patient having at least one first-degree relative with diverticulitis.  The ED group consisted of five surgically managed patients over age 65 (mean age 72, 3M/2F) without a family history of diverticulitis.  Full thickness bowel wall from patients in both FD and ED groups were obtained from both diseased (Ds) and adjacent normal (Nl) sigmoid colon.  The C group had single normal samples from five patients (mean age 50, 2M/3F) who required sigmoid resection (endometriosis: 2, polyp/cancer: 3), without diverticulosis.  Total RNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tissue specimens, quality confirmed with RNA Integrity Number &gt; 7.0, converted to cDNA and barcoded for next generation sequencing.  Pooled libraries were loaded onto an Illumina HiSeq 2500 and run for 50 cycles using the single-read protocol setting.  Quality filtered sequencing reads were de-multiplexed and aligned to the human reference genome (hg38) using Tophat.  RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads) values were calculated after applying GC-content and quantile normalizations using an R package 'cqn.' An R package 'limma' identified differentially expressed genes between tissue groups based on empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics and associated P-values. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  58 genes were differentially expressed (p&lt;0.015) between FD-Nl vs. ED-Nl and/or C.  Based on biological function and eliminating non-coding transcripts and pseudogenes, 3 genes of the same nuclear receptor superfamily (NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3) clustered, sharing similar expression profiles.  Expression of these genes was significantly decreased in FD-Nl compared to ED-Nl and C groups.  In addition, these gene transcripts were reduced in FD-Ds vs. ED-Ds.  There was no significant difference between Ds and Nl tissues in either FD or ED.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Expression of NR4A family of nuclear receptors, which are modulators of immunity via the NF-&kappa;B pathway and known to be altered in several inflammatory states such as atherosclerosis and psoriasis, was decreased in both diseased and normal sigmoid of FD vs. ED patients.

Warner<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Washington University,Pediatric Surgery/General Surgery,St. Louis, MO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that is important for intestinal stem cell renewal and maintaining mucosa structure. It is also essential for Wnt-driven intestinal tumor initiation and growth. Rapamycin can bind the mTORC1 complex resulting in inhibition of downstream signals and intestinal regeneration. Intestinal adaptation is a phenomenon that occurs after small bowel resection (SBR) with increased crypt depth and villus height which is believed to be driven by enhanced enterocyte proliferation. Our objective was to investigate whether mTOR signaling is necessary for small bowel adaptation after SBR.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Male C57/Bl6 mice,aged 8 weeks underwent a 50% proximal SBR. Postoperatively,mice were randomized to receive daily injections of rapamycin (n=8) or vehicle (n=7). On postoperative day 7,mice were harvested and intestine was collected for histology to measure structural adaptation by counting crypt depth and villus height. Rates of enterocyte proliferation were measured by counting the number of p-histone 3 stained cells per 20 crypts. Western blot confirmed rapamycin inhibition of mTOR signaling by probing for pS6. To see whether rapamycin affects the integrity of intestinal structure at baseline, rapamycin (n=4) and vehicle (n=5) were injected daily in two separate groups of non-operative mice. After 7 days,mice were harvested and histology and proliferation were compared. Student's t-test was used to statistically compare groups with p&lt;0.05 defined as significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The degree of adaptation was diminished in the rapamycin treated group compared to controls after proximal 50% SBR (Figure). Similarly,rates of proliferation significantly dropped in rapamycin treated group compared to vehicle treated group (2.1&plusmn;0.1 vs 4.5&plusmn;0.3, p-value&lt;0.01). Western blot showed a decrease in pS6 signaling which confirms mTOR signaling inhibition by rapamycin within the enterocytes. Daily injections of rapamycin in non-operated C57/Bl6 mice did not affect crypt depth (74.9&plusmn;3.5&micro;m vs 72.5&plusmn;3.5&micro;m,p-value=0.7) or villus height (219.8&plusmn;9.9&micro;m vs 215.9&plusmn;8.0&micro;m, p-value=0.8) when compared to vehicle injections. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:mTorC1 pathway may play a critical role in intestinal adaptation post SBR. Rapamycin diminishes the degree of adaptation and enterocyte proliferation after SBR. However,rapamycin was given systemically in this study and tissue specific contribution of mTOR signaling in adaptation could not be determined. This is the first time mTor pathway has been studied in the context of resection-associated adaptation. Further studies will focus on the role of enterocyte specific mTOR signaling involved in intestinal adaptation.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","General Surgery"

CBS produces the gaseous transmitter hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), which we showed promotes CRC growth and metastasis by stimulating tumor cell bioenergetics (i.e., product of ATP for cell proliferation), and creating a localized H<sub>2</sub>S-rich microenvironment that stimulates tumor angiogenesis and local vasodilatation to feed and disseminate the growing cancer cells. However, the role of CBS/H<sub>2</sub>S in the progression of disease from adenoma to adenocarcinoma is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether forced overexpression of CBS in a non-malignant colonic cell line (NCM356) would induce a malignant phenotype. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  NCM356 (parental) cells express a very low level of endogenous CBS, similar to normal colonic mucosa, and are non-tumorigenic when xenografted into immune compromised mice. CBS overexpressing (NCMCBS) and control (NCMvec) cells where produced by transducing parental cells with a lentiviral vector containing a CBS cDNA or the empty vector, respectively. Western blotting was used to assess CBS protein levels. Levels of H<sub>2</sub>S were visualized in intact cells using the H<sub>2</sub>S-specific fluorescent probe, AzMC (7-azido-4-methylcoumarin). The amount of H<sub>2</sub>S was quantified by measuring the conversion of CBS substrates L-cysteine and L-homocysteine in protein extracts using AzMC. Cell growth rates where determined with a Coulter Counter. aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) was used to inhibit CBS activity. Cell migration and invasion assay were performed in Boyden chambers with NIH3T3 conditioned media as a chemo-attractant. Anchorage-independent growth was assessed by soft-agar assay. Statistical significance (p&le;0.05) was calculated using ANOVA or non-parametric Student t-test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:NCMCBS cells showed a marked increase in H<sub>2</sub>S levels by microscopy and a 4-fold increased in NCM-CBS protein extracts, compared to either NCMvec or the parental cell line. CBS overexpression enhanced proliferation rate (p&lt;0.03 NCMCBS vs. NCMvec or parental), cell migration, invasion through matrigel (p&lt;0.01), and colony formation in soft agar (p&lt;0.01). The stimulatory effects of CBS overexpression on NCM cell migration and invasion were inhibited by AOAA (p&lt;0.01). Exosome-wide sequence analyses of the parental cells identified inactivating mutations in the APC and TP53 tumor suppressor genes, and an activating mutation in KRAS.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Colorectal carcinogenesis requires the accumulation of multiple mutations and the derangement of normal cellular metabolism. Our data demonstrate that forced overexpression of CBS can induce a malignant (i.e. invasive) phenotype in a cell line that is normally non-invasive, suggesting that CBS may play a role in adenoma to adenocarcinoma progression during colorectal carcinogenesis.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Despite advances in therapy, the outcomes for children with advanced-staged disease remain dismal. The role of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a tumor suppressor has been characterized in other cancers. We hypothesized that increasing tumor suppressor PP2A activity would inhibit tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma cells.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Institution approval was obtained from IRB (X111123007) and IACUC (09064). Immunohistochemical staining for the endogenous PP2A inhibitor, I2PP2A, was completed on 25 human neuroblastoma specimens. Slides were scored by a blinded pathologist and a stain score calculated based upon the formula of percent of cells staining positive (0-100%) &times; intensity of the stain (0-3) resulting in a score from 0-300. Human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-EP and WAC2 were utilized. Activation of PP2A was accomplished with multiple approaches: transient inhibition of the endogenous inhibitor (I2PP2A) with siRNA and stable knockdown with shRNA; non-specific activation with forskolin; direct activation with small molecule FTY720. Migration and invasion assays were performed with Transwell plates. Proliferation was measured using CellTiter96 assay. Stable I2PP2A knockdown clones in the SH-EP and WAC2 cell lines were used for in vivo studies. Empty vector (shEV) control and shI2PP2A cells (2.5 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> cells) were injected into the right flank of nude mice (N=5/group) and animals monitored for tumor growth for 2 months. Data reported as median (range) or mean &plusmn; SEM and Student's t-test was used to compare data between groups, with p &le; 0.05 considered significant. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:I2PP2A staining was present in 22 of the 25 human specimens examined and the median stain score was 140 (0-180), indicating presence of the endogenous PP2A inhibitor. Protein for I2PP2A and PP2A was detected in both neuroblastoma cell lines. Transient inhibition of I2PP2A with siRNA significantly decreased migration and invasion in both cell lines. Further, small molecule activation of PP2A with forskolin or FTY720 significantly decreased proliferation in both cell lines. Finally, stable clones with knock-down of I2PP2A, the endogenous PP2A inhibitor, allowing activation of PP2A, showed significantly decreased tumor growth in both the SH-EP (1211 &plusmn; 587 mm<sup>3 </sup>vs. 347 &plusmn; 149 mm<sup>3</sup>, shEV vs. shI2PP2A, p=0.04) and WAC2 (1714 &plusmn; 210 mm<sup>3 </sup>vs. 1031 &plusmn; 139 mm<sup>3</sup>, shEV vs. shI2PP2A, p=0.01) cell lines.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The activation of PP2A in neuroblastoma cell lines by inhibition of the endogenous inhibitor (I2PP2A) and direct activation with forskolin or FTY720 significantly inhibited cellular proliferation, migration and invasion. Also, knockdown of the PP2A inhibitor, I2PP2A, led to inhibition of neuroblastoma tumor growth in vivo.

Major regulatory components of the TMEN are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), of which a significant proportion originate from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Osteopontin (OPN) is secreted by tumor cells and can induce the transformation of MSCs to CAFs. Our objective was to determine how tumor-derived OPN regulates time-dependent plasticity of the CAF phenotype in a hepatocellulcar carcinoma (HCC) model. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Experiments were conducted using HepG2 (high OPN expressing) and Hep3B (low OPN expressing) HCC cell lines. All co-culture experiments were performed in a permeable support system with MSCs seeded in the lower compartment and HepG2/Hep3B cells in removable inserts (pores =0.4 &micro;m). Measurement of active TGF- &beta; was done using ELISA. Relative mRNA expression of MSC/CAF signature genes (&alpha;-SMA, tenacin-C, vimentin) were quantified by using RT-PCR. Changes in MSC cell surface markers were measured using flow cytometry. Mean values reported &plusmn; SD.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:HepG2 cells co-cultured with MSCs induced the mRNA expression of CAF genes (&alpha;-SMA ddCT=11.7&plusmn;0.1) at 72h while Hep3B cells did not in similar culture conditions (&alpha;-SMA ddCT=1.6&plusmn;0.1, p&lt;0.001).

Blockage of OPN with aptamer (APT) at onset of co-culture inhibited the transformation of MSCs to CAFs indicating an essential role for OPN in the initiation of the CAF phenotype. To measure the impact of tumor-derived OPN on CAF phenotype maintenance, activated CAFs were treated with OPN APT while remaining in co-culture. CAF signature gene mRNA expression remained elevated. In contrast, when HepG2 cells were completely removed from co-culture, CAF gene mRNA expression returned to baseline levels (Figure). Expression of MSC cell surface markers CD105, CD146, and CD90 were compared at each time point, with CD105 being down-regulated at 72h of co-culture. After withdrawal of HepG2 cells, CD105 remained down-regulated suggesting the CAF did not revert back to its original MSC phenotype. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:We demonstrate OPN is critical for inducing the MSC to CAF transformation in an in vitro HCC model. After CAF activation, tumor-derived OPN is not required for continued maintenance of CAF indicating a secondary signal pathway responsible for stabilizing CAFs. These findings are the first to demonstrate CAF phenotypic plasticity relies on separate initiating and maintenance signaling pathways.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

They are small membrane vesicles (40-100nm) that contain microRNAs (miRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), DNA, and proteins. Given the variety of nucleic acids contained by exosomes, there is interest in their use as biomarkers of cancer. Studies show that circulating serum exosomes contain RNA signatures representative of the parental tumor [2, 3].  Applications of circulating exosomes to tumor diagnosis have been described for various cancers [4-6]. The work herein is focused on utilizing exosomes as markers of response to therapy, as well as to identify potential mediators active in this process. Our pilot set of serum samples have been collected at both pre-treatment and on-treatment timepoints. Our hypothesis is that there may be exosomal signatures that correspond with treatment response or resistance to current therapies.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We have collected serial tumor and blood samples from patients with metastatic melanoma enrolled on clinical trials with various therapies since these trials opened. Tissue and blood are collected using protocols approved by the institutional review board (IRB). Exosome isolation has been performed by both serial centrifugation and exoRNeasy serum/plasma kits (Qiagen Inc.).  Assesment of exosome size and concentration is done using Nanosight analyses. Western blots have been performed for CD63/flotillin, markers associated with exosomes.

We can now model these findings in an in vitro system, showing that non-cancer cells have a much lower concentration of exosomal proteins in cell culture as compared to those derived from melanoma cell lines (data not shown).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Circulating microvesicles are enriched in melanoma patients as compared to normal healthy controls, a finding replicable in an in vitro system. In patient samples, the concentration correlates with tumor burden, suggesting potential utility as a circulating biomarker of disease. Efforts at profiling the mRNA/miRNA content of these exosomes is ongoing and may shed light on the mechanisms of response or resistance to current therapies.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

To date, no effective systemic therapies for MTC have been established. AB3 is a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) that has been shown to diminish MTC cell line proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Preliminary studies have suggested that phenotypic regulation by AB3 may be mediated by Notch3 signaling; however, AB3&#39;s broader effects on gene expression and its mode of Notch3 activation are not well understood.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The effects of AB3 treatment on transcription were investigated using a DNA microarray. Human MTC cell lines (MZ-CRC-1 and TT) were treated with 2 uM AB3 or DMSO vehicle control. The microarray results were filtered to remove non-coding genes, unnamed genes, and genes with an absolute fold change &lt;1.5 or ANOVA p-value &gt;0.05 in either cell line. Selected DNA microarray results were then validated by qRT-PCR. Lastly, a luciferase reporter construct harboring deletion fragments of the Notch3 upstream region was used to map AB3 responsive elements within the Notch3 promoter. Luciferase activity of the constructs and a promoter-less backbone were measured following treatment with AB3 (a Notch3 inducer) or vehicle control. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 67,528 genes were assessed by DNA microarray after AB3 treatment. Of these, 2,243 showed differential expression after filtering. Genes affected by AB3 treatment included members of the nuclear factor-&kappa;B (NF-&kappa;B) pathway and its targets: NFKB1, ATM, PARP1, XIAP, I&kappa;B&alpha;, cyclin D1, and BCL2 (down-regulated), as well as SENP2 (up-regulated). These results were consistent with NF-&kappa;B pathway down-regulation and were validated by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, qRT-PCR showed substantial increases in Notch 1-3 transcription, including a 33 fold increase in Notch3. Deletion mapping identified the potential AB3-responsive elements within the human Notch3 promoter as a 31-bp fragment located 109 to 140 nucleotides upstream of the Notch3 start codon.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Down-regulation of the NF-&kappa;B pathway by AB3 was demonstrated by DNA microarray and validated by qRT-PCR. NF-&kappa;B is a major stress-responsive transcription factor whose activation is associated with intrinsic cancer cell resistance to chemo- and radiation therapy. Understanding the mechanism by which AB3 down-regulates NF-&kappa;B could provide insight into improving HDACi-based therapies. Furthermore, we describe for the first time the potential HDACi binding site within the Notch3 promoter, which could determine the mechanism(s) of HDACi regulation of Notch signaling.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Since bone and soft tissue sarcomas commonly afflict dogs, and canine clinical trials are a tremendous resource, particularly for novel immunotherapy protocols, we hypothesized that dog PBMC-derived NK cells could be similarly expanded and activated ex vivo as a precursor for a canine combination radioimmunotherapy clinical trial. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Dog NK cells were isolated from 10-15 mL fresh PBMCs using Ficoll separation and CD5 depletion. Isolated NK cells (CD3+, CD5dim, TCR-) were expanded via co-culture with irradiated (100Gy) K562-C9-mIL21 for 2-3 weeks in 100IU/mL recombinant human IL-2. Canine osteosarcoma (OSCA) tumor lines and fresh canine primary sarcomas were evaluated for susceptibility to NK killing before/after RT in vitro and in xenograft experiments with NSG mice. NK cytotoxicity was assessed in 4-16 hour killing assays by Flow cytometry using a BD Fortessa cell sorter (BD Biosciences) with 7-Aminoactinomycin as cell viability marker. Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests were performed as appropriate.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  NK expansion was successful in 14/20 donors (including 9 tumor-bearing dogs) from baseline 4.5(&plusmn;1.9) x10<sup>6 </sup>cells to 103.5(&plusmn;29.1) x10<sup>6</sup>, mean increase 23.2X (&plusmn;2.3). Canine NK cells were also responsive to human cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, and IL-18), but expansions were lower (1.6-3.5 fold expansion over 14 days). NK cytotoxicity to OSCA78, OSCA32, and NK-sensitive CTAC cells in vitro increased in a dose-dependent fashion reaching 74 &ndash; 88% cytolysis at effector:target ratios of 10:1 &ndash; 20:1 (P&lt;0.001). RT augmented NK cytotoxicity with greatest synergy at 2.5-5 Gy RT in 4-hour killing assays (1.3-3.4X increased killing, P&lt;0.01). At doses of 10 Gy and/or 16-hour killing assays, only minor differences in overall killing were observed. Similar results were observed with RT sensitization to NK killing in primary canine sarcomas.

Drug combinations that help in reducing the doses of these drugs while providing better treatment response are required. Minnelide (triptolide prodrug, currently in phase I trials) has been shown to be effective against pancreatic cancer in preclinical models. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of Minnelide in combination with reduced doses of standard therapy in PDA.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In vitro, pancreatic cancer cells (S2-VP10, S2-013 and PANC-1) were treated with low doses of paclitaxel (0-25nM), low dose of triptolide (25nM), and a combination of both for 24-72h. Cell viability was measured by the WST-8 assay. Cancer cell death by apoptosis was evaluated by measuring cleaved caspase-3 levels using flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis was done using propidium iodide staining.In vivo, combination therapy was tested in various models of PDA. Xenograft, subcutaneous, and orthotopic models were established using S2-VP10 and S2-013 pancreatic cancer cells. The immunocompetent subcutaneous model was established using KPC derived cells in C57BL/6J wild type mice. Due to the development of fatal immune reaction in mice treated with nab-paclitaxel (due to human albumin), equivalent doses of paclitaxel (dissolved in DMSO) were used in immunocompetent mice while immunodeficient mice were treated with nab-paclitaxel. Tumors were harvested, and tissues were used for various experiments.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In vitro, proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells was markedly inhibited by the combination of triptolide and paclitaxel. Low doses of triptolide and paclitaxel led to significantly increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP suggesting that apoptotic cell death was induced in these cells. The combination therapy also led to an increased number of these cells trapped in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In vivo: In the s/c model, combination of low doses of Minnelide and paclitaxel inhibited tumor progression. The tumor volumes in various groups were: Minnelide: 75.4 &plusmn;25 %, paclitaxel: 50.0 &plusmn;3%, Minnelide + paclitaxel: 11.0 &plusmn;1%. In the metastasis orthotopic cancer model, median survival (in days) of animals in different treatments groups was vehicle (13.0), Minnelide (20.5), paclitaxel (21.5) and combination (all alive). The combination of Minnelide and low doses of gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel was effective in decreasing the tumor burden in orthotopic models and increasing survival of tumor-bearing mice. Besides decreasing tumor burden, combination treatment significantly reduced cancer-related morbidity by decreasing ascites and metastasis.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Minnelide synergizes with standard of care chemotherapy, reduces the doses of these toxic drugs and achieves better efficacy in treatment of PDA.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

However, mechanisms underlying muscle wasting in the human disease remain incompletely described, in part due to limited translational models. We hypothesize that the development of translational models of pancreatic cancer cachexia will allow for the delineation of potential therapeutic targets in cachexia. To test our hypothesis, we propose to 1) establish the first described PDX model of cancer cachexia and 2) examine skeletal muscle in patients and corresponding patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to further support a central role for transcription factors associated in PC-associated cachexia.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Rectus abdominis muscle was biopsied from surgically resected PC patients and non-cancer pancreatitis controls.

These architectural abnormalities were also present in mice bearing xenografts representative patients with muscle wasting. Further, skeletal muscle from patients with PC and mice bearing PDX demonstrated high expression of the same Forkhead box O (FoxO)-dependent, atrophy-associated transcription factors.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Preoperative muscle wasting in PC is associated with characteristic architectural abnormalities and elevated FoxO-dependent transcriptional activity. Mice bearing patient-derived xenografts demonstrate comparable muscle pathology and transcriptional activity.

Pharmacological Ascorbate has been shown to increase the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy and radiation in solid tumors secondary to generation of toxic hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).  We therefore hypothesize that Ascorbate, when combined with current multimodality therapies, will increase cytotoxicity in tumor growth and metastasis cell models of GAC.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Human GAC cell lines MKN-45 and AGS, and normal human stomach/intestinal cell line, Hs738st/Int, were evaluated for clonogenic survival after treatment with clinically relevant doses of Ascorbate (25pmol/cell) and pertinent multimodality therapies including 5-flurouracil (5FU, 5uM), and Ionizing Radiation (IR, 1.8Gy). Cytotoxicity of AGS cells was evaluated with Ascorbate both with and without cisplatin (0.5uM) and irinotecan (2.5uM).  GAC cell lines were treated with bovine catalase and deferoxamine (DFO) plus diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) to confirm the mechanisms of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated cell death following Ascorbate exposure in the model systems.  Tumor cell invasive capacity was measured using matrigel migration and invasion assays. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Ascorbate reduced GAC clonogenic survival by 50% (p &lt;0.0001) compared to control. Ascorbate when combined with 5-FU or IR resulted in significant increases in cell death compared to 5-FU or IR alone.  Triple therapy with Ascorbate, 5FU, and IR showed enhancement in cytotoxicity that was significantly increased over the standard multimodality therapy regimen (Figure, p &lt;0.01).  Ascorbate increased cell death when combined with irinotecan and cisplatin compared to either chemotherapy drug alone.  Ascorbate combined with catalase or DFO+DTPA yielded a full rescue of cytotoxicity from the toxic effects of Ascorbate treatment (p&lt;0.0001) thereby confirming the dependence on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels and catalytic metal ions for cellular death to occur.   Ascorbate significantly reduced tumor cell invasion by 57% (p &lt; 0.003) and tumor cell migration by 61% (p &lt; 0.002) compared to control.  Normal gastric cell clonogenic survival was not altered by treatment with Ascorbate, suggesting treatment selectivity for malignant cells and safety in normal cells.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Pharmacologic Ascorbate is highly toxic to GAC cells at pharmacologic concentrations while having no effect on normal cells; Ascorbate also reduces tumor cell invasive capacity.  Our data confirm that Ascorbate exerts its cytotoxicity via generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and is dependent upon the presence of catalytic metal ions.  These highly translational data suggest that Pharmacological Ascorbate is a potential novel therapy for the treatment of GAC.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

The amplification of the transcription factor MYCN predicts poor prognosis and correlates with an undifferentiated cell phenotype. MYCN is expressed during normal NCSC development, regulating neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation at distinct time points.  Our preliminary work has shown that deregulation of MYCN during normal human NCSC differentiation increases cell proliferation, motility, migration, and invasion in-vitro.  To further determine how MYCN contributes to NB tumorigenesis, we generated a novel in-vivo human model to test our hypothesis that MYCN deregulation during early NCSC development is a critical component of tumor initiation.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) were plated on a mouse embryonic fibroblasts feeder layer and grown in stromal-derived inducing activity (SDIA) media to differentiate into NCSC. NCSC were collected using staining for p75 and HNK1+ neural markers by FACS. Double positive sorted cells were then transduced with a doxycycline inducible V5-tagged MYCN cDNA lentiviral construct.  MYCN expression was confirmed by Western blot and immunocytochemistry (ICC).  NCSC-MYCN+ cells in a 1:1 mix with matrigel were flank-injected into NOD/SCID mice, while NCSC-MYCN- cells were injected into the opposite flanks. Mice were fed doxycycline water to induce MYCN expression. Animals were monitored daily for health and tumor formation. Resultant tumors were excised, characterized, and examined for tumor markers using paraffin-embedded slides stained for H/E, MYCN, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), Chromogranin A, and TrkB.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: NCSC-MYCN+ cells formed robust tumors at flank injection sites that were metastatic to the abdominal cavity, while NCSC-MYCN- flanks did not form tumors. Primary and metastatic tumors were locally invasive and morphologically consistent with poorly differentiated NB, with immature neuroecterdermal cells that palisaded around blood vessels, forming pseudorosettes and brisk mitotic rates. Resultant tumors stained positive for TH, Chromogranin A, TrkB, and MYCN. Sections of lymph nodes and abdominal spread sites were consistent with NB and stained positive for all markers as well.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results are progress towards establishing the first human model of NB using hESC and human NCSC, and further implicate MYCN in early NCSC tumor initiation.  These data demonstrate that forced constitutive expression of MYCN is sufficient for NCSC tumor initiation in-vivo that is capable of metastatic spread, and pave the way for studies to determine how NB tumors develop.","Basic Science","Developmental Biology/Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering","Pediatrics"

Previous studies have demonstrated epithelial architecture and some enzymatic function in HIOs that replicates native intestine, but the resultant tissue lacked elements of the enteric nervous system (ENS).  In contrast, intestine derived from multicellular organoid units (OU) derived from postnatal human or mouse intestine contain neurons and glia. We therefore hypothesized that co-implantation of HIOs with murine OU would generate tissue-engineered intestine with ENS components. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: HIOs were generated as previously described with sequential application of Activin A followed by FGF4 and CHIR99021 to promote patterning of intestinal spheroids. Spheroids were placed in Matrigel with growth medium that contained EGF, R-spondin 2 (RSPO2) and Noggin (NOG) to further promote HIO growth as previously described (Spence 2011, Watson 2014). Intestine from actin<sup>GFP</sup> mice were resected and then mechanically and enzymatically digested to form GFP OU. In the first group, 20 HIOs were pipetted onto the surface of a 3 mm polyglycolic/poly-L lactic acid tube.  In the second group, GFP OU were co-implanted with HIOs. Both constructs were implanted into the omentum of adult irradiated NOD/SCID gamma mice. Harvest was at 12 weeks. Immunofluorescent staining with neuronal markers &beta; III tubulin (TUJ1) and neuronal nuclei (NeuN), and glial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100b) identified ENS elements. Human and murine elements were differentiated by staining for human specific human mitochondria (hMito) and GFP<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Implantation of HIOs with and without OU formed small intestinal epithelium with villus-crypt architecture and all differentiated epithelial cell types surrounded by smooth muscle. All the epithelium was either hMito+, confirming HIO origin, or GFP+, indicating OU origin. Intestine generated from HIOs alone did not contain any neurons or glia. However, co-implantation of HIOs with OU resulted in hMito+ epithelium and adjacent subepithelial and myenteric GFP+ neurons and glia. GFAP and S100b localized to different subpopulations of glia. Tuj1 and GFAP co-stained a subset of GFP+ structures. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Co-implantation of OU with HIO generates tissue-engineered intestine with human epithelium and OU-derived neurons and glia in the subepithelial and myenteric layers, thus replicating the structure of normal human intestine including ENS components. This demonstrates that implantation of supplemental and separate cells with HIOs can successfully generate tissue-engineered intestine with ENS elements.","Basic Science","Developmental Biology/Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering","Pediatrics"

A similar phenomenon is seen in the adapting small intestine after massive bowel resection. Serotonin (5-HT), a ubiquitous neurotransmitter in the bowel, has been implicated as an important regulator of intestinal mucosal homeostasis by promoting growth in the epithelium. The impact of 5-HT on other components of growing villi is not known. We hypothesized that 5-HT-stimulated growth in the intestinal epithelium would be associated with growth in other components of the villus such as enteric neural axonal processes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Enteric serotonergic signaling is inactivated by the SERT molecule located on enterocytes and enteric nerves. Knock out of SERT (SERTKO) or treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) effectively enhances serotonergic signaling by blocking its inactivation. Therefore, 8 week-old wild type (WT), SERTKO, and SSRI-treated wild type mice were used for experiments. For SSRI treatment, a miniosmotic pump containing citalopram was inserted subcutaneously and left in place for 7 days before sacrifice. Paraffin-embedded sections were created from predefined segments of ileum harvested from each experimental group. Villus height and crypt depth were assessed in H&amp;E-stained sections. Crypt proliferation index was calculated using Ki67 staining. Immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies targeting Gap43, a marker of axonal growth, was performed and tiled images were obtained to visualize multiple villi in cross section. Images were analyzed with ImageJ software using integrated optical density and region of interest (ROI) tool. Adequate villi with a visualized central lacteal were identified and a ratio of Gap43 to DAPI signal was obtained to normalize differences in villus size.

These pathways are critical for NB cancer stem cell (CSC) function and these CSCs have been ascribed the capacity to recapitulate a tumor from a few cells, enhance tumor drug resistance or its metastatic potential. While withanolides are potent against NB, they do not directly target NB cells and are difficult to solubilize in vivo. Synthetic HDL mimetic (sHDL) targets the SR-B1 receptor on the cell surface and solubilizes lipophilic drugs like WGA-TA. Since NB cells and their CSCs highly overexpress SR-B1, we hypothesize that nanoparticle conjugation of a novel mimetic sHDL nanoparticle with WGA-TA will improve targeting and inhibition of NB CSC function in vitro and in vivo to decrease tumor growth, self-renewal and invasion.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Validated human NB cells (IMR32,SH-EP,SH-SY5Y,SK-N-BE(2),and SK-N-AS) were evaluated for the expression of SR-B1 by qPCR and western blot (WB). Drug uptake in vitro was measured by fluorescence microscopy, and in vivo uptake in NB tumors (IMR32) was measured on an IVIS system using fluorescent labeled drug. Self renewal and migration/invasion were assessed by sphere formation and Boyden chamber assays, respectively. Percentage viability was analyzed by Cell-Titer Glow(CTG) assay.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: qPCR and WB analysis revealed a 4-6 fold higher-level expression of SR-B1 in N-myc amplified NB cells compared to N-myc non-amplified or Jurkat cells(p&lt;0.01). In vitro uptake of sHDL indicated significantly higher levels of uptake in high SR-B1 expressing (IMR32, SK-N-BE(2)) cells compared to low expressers(SH-EP, SH-SY5Y), which was almost completely blocked by excess sHDL(p&lt;0.001). IVIS imaging of IMR32 tumors indicated highest uptake of sHDL in the tumor and liver (where it is metabolized) whereas uptake in other organs was negligible. After treatment of both IMR32 and SK-N-BE(2) cells, there was a dose dependent decrease in sphere formation starting from 8 nM [with complete blockage of self renewal at 62.5 nM (p&lt;0.001 vs control)], and invasion and migration starting at 250 nM vs. untreated control (p&lt;0.001). There was no change in cell viability for sHDL up to 20 &micro; M, whereas the sHDL-WGA-TA and WGA-TA had an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 15-100nM which was 15-51 fold higher than the IC<sub>50</sub> of control MRC5 cells(p&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Mimetic sHDL-WGA-TA is a novel treatment strategy for NB to improve drug delivery to NBs and their CSCs through SR-B1 targeting in vitro and in vivo. sHDL conjugation of withanolides enhances their ability to prevent NB tumor self-renewal and migration/invasion in vitro. Further in vivo efficacy studies are warranted to evaluate the translation effect of NB CSC inhibition on tumor growth, invasion, and metastatic spread.","Basic Science","Developmental Biology/Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering","Pediatrics"

Reeder<sup>1</sup>, P. F. Nichol<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin,Pediatric Surgery,Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Intestinal atresia can lead to chronic health issues including intestinal dysmotility, short gut syndrome, and, in extreme cases, intestinal failure. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to atresia is critical to developing preventative strategies for this defect and its sequelae. Previous work hypothesized that intestinal atresia results from persistence of a developmental epithelial plug, vascular accident, or mechanical obstruction.  Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2IIIb (Fgfr2IIIb) is a transmembrane receptor expressed only in the intestinal epithelium during early intestinal organogenesis. Homozygous mutation of Fgfr2IIIb throughout the developing embryo results in intestinal atresia of the distal colon in 100% of all embryos. However, atresias arising from epithelial-specific mutation of Fgfr2IIIb during intestinal development have never been shown. We hypothesized that conditional mutation of Fgfr2IIIb within the developing intestinal epithelium is sufficient to induce intestinal atresia. We modified the existing mouse model to directly test this hypothesis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The epithelial specific Cre driver Sonic Hedgehog Cre (ShhCre) was used to selectively mutate Fgfr2IIIb in the developing intestinal epithelium by mating Fgfr2IIIb<sup>LoxP/+</sup>; Shh<sup>EGFPCre/+</sup> males to Fgfr2IIIb<sup>LoxP/LoxP</sup> females.  For lineage analysis Shh<sup>EGFPCre/+ </sup>breedings were performed on a Rosa<sup>LacZ</sup> background with or without Fgfr2IIIb<sup>LoxP </sup>alleles. TUNEL and BrdU staining was performed at embryonic age (E)10.5, in situ hybridization for Fgfr2IIIb was performed at E11.5.  Lineage analysis was performed at E13.5. Incidence of colonic atresia was determined. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:ShhCre  eliminated Fgfr2IIIb expression specifically from the intestinal epithelium in Fgfr2IIIb<sup>LoxP/r</sup>; Shh<sup>EGFPCre/+</sup> mouse embryos resulting in distal colonic atresias in all homozygous conditional mutants by E13.5 (40/40) where as control littermates did not form atresias (0/155) (P&lt;0.01). TUNEL staining was increased in the proximal colon, but largely absent from the distal colon at E10.5. BrdU labeling was diminished throughout the colon at this same time point. Lineage analysis demonstrated that atresias were fully formed by E13.5 and featured an absence of both colonic epithelium and surrounding mesenchyme.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This data supports our hypothesis that epithelial-specific mutation of Fgfr2IIIb is sufficient to induce distal colonic atresias in mice. ShhCre eliminates expression of the Fgfr2IIIb conditional alleles from the intestinal epithelium; a tissue layer separate from the one that gives rise to the vasculature of the intestine.  Thus, our findings also suggest that disruptions in epithelial development alone are sufficient to induce atresias and point to a potential mechanism separate from vascular accidents in the etiology of these defects.","Basic Science","Developmental Biology/Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering","Pediatrics"

In CDH, the pulmonary arteries have thick walls due to smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, increased collagen deposition, and marked inflammation, leading to fibrotic remodeling of the perivasculature. Adult models of PAH and fibrosis demonstrate a dysregulation of hyaluronan (HA) metabolism in the pulmonary vasculature, which may contribute to increased inflammatory response. The role of HA has not been examined in neonatal PAH and CDH.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The main challenge in studying CDH is the lack of a viable congenital murine model that develops PAH. We are characterizing the phenotype of the Slit3-/- mouse which shows a CDH at birth with a resultant increase in right ventricular pressures (surrogate for pulmonary arterial pressures) and evidence of vascular wall remodeling in the pulmonary arteries that mimics the human phenotype. To determine the dysregulation of HA metabolism in CDH, lungs from Slit3-/- or WT-control mice at 8-12 weeks (n=3-4/group) were harvested. RNA was isolated from frozen lung samples, and hyaluronan synthases (HAS1-3) and hyaluronidases (Hyal1-2) were measured (RT PCR). HA expression was determined in paraffin-embedded sections (HA-binding protein, staining). Data represented as mean+/-SD; p&lt;0.5 denotes significance; t-test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Compared to WT mice, the Slit3-/- mice progressively develop right ventricular remodeling, thickening of the pulmonary arteries, increased collagen, and TGF&beta;1 expression. Slit3-/- murine lungs expressed a significant (5-fold) increase in HAS1 gene expression (11.11+/-3.34 vs. 2.3+/-1.93, p&lt;0.05) compared to WT-controls. There was no significant difference in the other 2 hyaluronan synthases, HAS2 (0.84+/-0.41 vs. 0.84+/-0.34) or HAS3 (0.69+/-0.24 vs. 1.15+/-0.8). Interestingly, the gene expression of hyaluronidases was also significantly higher in Slit3-/- murine lungs compared to WT-controls, including Hyal1 (3.24+/-0.68 vs. 1.02+/-0.11, p&lt;0.01) and Hyal2 (2.58+/-0.57 vs. 0.84+/-0.15, p&lt;0.01).

We also showed an increase in HA expression in the perivasculature in the lungs of Slit3-/- mice. These data provide evidence for a possible role of HA metabolism in the development of PAH in CDH, and HA may represent a novel therapeutic target.

Therapeutic options which restore the viability of irradiated bone for reconstruction hold the promise to allow DO to become an effective alternative for reconstruction in patients who have undergone radiation therapy (XRT). Bone marrow stem cells possess the capability to differentiate into osteoblasts and stimulate endogenous growth factors. Additionally, intermittent parathyroid hormone is known to stimulate bone deposition. We posit that the effects of these therapeutic agents will act synergistically to improve cellularity and function, and curtail the destructive effects of XRT in a murine model of mandibular DO.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Lewis rats were divided into 5 groups: non-radiated distraction (DO), radiated distraction (xDO), radiated distraction with intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH), radiated distraction with intraoperatively placed bone marrow stem cells (BMSC), and radiated distraction with both therapies (Combined). Groups receiving radiation were exposed to a human-equivalent dose of 35 Gy over a 5-day period. All groups underwent distraction to a distance of 5.1 mm. Coronal sections from the distraction site were stained using Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin, Safranin O, and Gomori's Trichrome. Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA and subsequent Tukey or Games-Howell post-hoc tests.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Rats in the combined therapy group demonstrated improved metrics of histology and histomorphometry when compared to the xDO group. Osteocyte count was significantly improved by combination therapy over xDO (p=0.00). Additionally, empty lacunae were decreased in the combined therapy group as compared to the xDO group (p=0.00) and both singular therapies. Combination therapy also improved the histomorphometric quality of the regenerate bone demonstrating less immature osteoid volume (p=0.01) and much more mature woven bone (p=0.00). Furthermore, the composition of relative mature bone volume in the combined group (0.56&plusmn;0.09) approached that of the bone regenerated by non-irradiated DO (0.52&plusmn;0.11), indicating that the combination therapy was able to overcome the XRT-induced devastation to the endogenous tissue.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In a murine model of DO, BMSCs in combination with intermittent PTH reverses XRT-induced cellular depletion, resulting in significant improvement in osteocyte presence with decreased empty lacunae. Regenerated bone treated with the combined therapy resembled bone that underwent DO without XRT, and resulted in better complete histomorphometric outcomes than bone treated with either therapy alone. Our combined therapy demonstrates the capability to assuage the damage incurred ensuing XRT and offers promise in the treatment of patients requiring mandibular reconstruction following XRT.","Basic Science","Wound Healing/Fibrosis","Plastics"

Supportive treatment such as parenteral nutrition is costly and has associated morbidity. Surgical intervention including bowel lengthening procedures and small bowel transplantation has met with varied success. Accordingly, alternative approaches to create tissue-engineered intestine offer novel, potentially curative therapeutic strategies to treat short bowel syndrome. Human enteroids, which are primary 3-dimensional tissue that can be generated from an endoscopic biopsy, recapitulate the complexities of the intestinal epithelium histologically and can be expanded exponentially in vitro. Consequently, enteroids can provide a limitless source of autologous intestinal epithelium. To date, successful transplantation of murine enteroids has required induction of colitis. In contrast, human enteroids have not been successfully transplanted into immunocompromised mice, likely due to inadequate supportive structures. Poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds have been shown to provide structural support for human cells. We thus hypothesized that placement of human enteroids on PLG scaffolds embedded with growth factors would permit long-term survival of enteroids post-transplant. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We generated enteroids from human small intestinal tissue by isolating intestinal epithelium from associated structures using dispase. After expanding these enteroids in vitro, we embedded enteroid fragments and the growth factors, EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin, onto PLG scaffolds. Enteroid-laden scaffolds were then grown in vitro for 1 week and assessed for survival by calcein and ethidium homodimer staining. Enteroid-laden scaffolds were also transplanted into the epididymal fat pads of immunocompromised NSG mice and harvested at 1 and 4 weeks. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our data demonstrated that enteroids grown on PLG scaffolds were able to survive for 1 week in vitro as indicated by positive calcein staining. When enteroid-containing scaffolds were transplanted into murine epididymal fat pads, all explants demonstrated regions of cells that stained positive for human mitochondrial antigen, Cdx2, and E-cadherin after both, 1 and 4 weeks post-transplant (n = 5, and n= 4, respectively). Together, these data indicate that human enteroids persist and retain their intestinal identity when set in scaffolds and transplanted into mice. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the first report demonstrating survival of human epithelial enteroids in a transplant model. As such, these studies have important implications for short bowel syndrome, because enteroid-laden scaffolds are easily generated from autologous tissue. Furthermore, scaffolds can be designed to resemble gut tubes such that future studies may examine the ability of scaffolds to be incorporated into the small intestine.","Basic Science","Developmental Biology/Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering","Pediatrics"

Transplantation of stem cells presents a novel treatment modality for this problem. Recent work suggests that bone marrow-derived stromal cells can protect the intestine from ischemia. However, the low proliferative potential and difficulties in isolating these cells make them difficult to implement on a large scale. Human adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC) have shown greater proliferative potential and are more readily isolated. We hypothesized that: 1) ASCs would increase seven day survival following intestinal ischemia, and 2) improved survival with ASC therapy would be associated with improved post-ischemic mesenteric perfusion. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Cells were cultured on polystyrene flasks at 37C in 5% CO2 in air. Human ASCs were grown in EGM2 with FBS and human nTERT keratinocytes (differentiated cell control) were cultured in Epilife media with keratinocyte growth factor. Two million cells in 250ul of PBS were used for experimentation. Adult male C57Bl6J mice (8-12 weeks, 20-30g) were anesthetized and a midline laparotomy performed. The intestines were eviscerated, the small bowel mesenteric root was identified, and baseline intestinal perfusion was determined using Laser Doppler Imaging. Intestinal I/R was established by temporarily occluding the superior mesenteric artery for 60 minutes with a non-crushing clamp. Following ischemia, the clamp was removed and the intestines reperfused. Immediately prior to abdominal closure, vehicle, ASCs, or keratinocytes were injected into the peritoneum.  Animals were allowed to reperfuse for 12 or 24 hours (perfusion studies), or 7 days (survival studies). After these designated times, animals were reanesthetized and a final perfusion scan was obtained. Perfusion data is expressed as a percentage of baseline. Groups were compared with student's t test and p&lt;0.05 was significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Animals administered ASCs following intestinal ischemia had significantly greater 7 day survival compared to vehicle or keratinocytes (ASC: 80% survival, keratinocytes: 20%, vehicle  40%, p&lt;0.05). Additionally, ASCs facilitated better post-ischemic recovery of mesenteric perfusion compared to vehicle or keratinocytes at 24 hours (ASC: 66.0+/-11.8%; PBS: 25.6 +/- 6.1%; keratinocytes: 25.0 +/-11.4%, p&lt;0.05) but not at 12 hours post-ischemia.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Adipose stromal cells attenuate post-ischemic intestinal injury and promote survival by enhancing mesenteric vascular perfusion. Further studies are needed to identify the mechanism that these cells utilize to promote improved perfusion. Understanding these mechanisms may allow for the design of stem cells that promote maximum effect during therapeutic use.","Basic Science","Developmental Biology/Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering","Pediatrics"

Management of HO is limited by efficacy of available treatments, difficulty identifying at-risk patients, and high recurrence rates following surgical excision. The cellular and molecular basis of HO is unknown. Here we investigate whether the cells themselves or their environment drive HO formation. We demonstrate that human and mouse cells isolated from sites of HO retain increased osteogenic capacity when cultured outside of an inflammatory environment.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Human cells were cultured from HO and surrounding normal bone. Mouse cells were obtained from two models including trauma-induced and genetic HO. Cells from the trauma induced model were isolated from the tendon transection site of mice which had undergone a dorsal burn with tendon transection (burn/tenotomy) at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after injury, a model that reliably produces HO. In the genetic HO model (Nfatc1-cre/caACVR1<sup>fl/wt</sup>) normal and HO-derived osteoblasts were isolated from 1, 2, and 3 week old mice. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed for by alkaline phosphatase production, alizarin red stain for mineral deposition, RNA expression, and protein expression. Cell proliferation was also assessed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Human HO cells showed increased osteogenic signaling compared to human osteoblasts from non-HO bone (Fig. 1). Cells isolated from the burn/tenotomy mice 2 and 3 weeks after injury demonstrated significantly increased cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, alizarin red stain, and pSmad 1/5 expression when compared with controls. Similarly, HO-derived cells from our genetic HO model in 2 or 3 week old mice exhibited increased cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, alizarin red stain, and pSmad 1/5 expression when compared with non-HO osteoblasts from the same mice (Fig. 2). Finally, targeting these cells with inhibitors of smad5 phosphorylation (LDN-193189) decreased osteogenic capacity by alkaline phosphatase and alizarin red quantification (p&lt;0.05), consistent with its effect on HO formation in our trauma model.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In vitro analysis demonstrates significant differences in cellular behavior with regard to proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in HO models when cells are cultured separate from their in vivo environment. This data suggest that changes in cell behavior drive the process of HO as cell characteristics are preserved after they are removed from their environment. Furthermore, the striking differences in these HO-derived cells from normal cells suggests that they may be used for in vitro assays to study potential therapies targeting HO development.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Trauma/Critical Care"

Previously, a rat model of hindlimb unloading after burn found bedrest contributes significantly to atrophy. In this model, we found that exercise increased the function and changed the fiber composition of slow-twitch muscle. We hypothesize that insulin with exercise will further diminish the loss of muscle function in burn with bedrest.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats received a full thickness 40% total body surface area (TBSA) burn and were randomly assigned (n=6) to vehicle without exercise (V/No), insulin (pro zinc 40U daily) without exercise (I/No), vehicle with exercise (V/Ex), or insulin with exercise (I/Ex). All animals were placed in a tail traction system for hindlimb unloading to mimic bed rest immediately following burn. The exercise group was trained to perform twice daily weighted resistance climbing of 1 meter with 5 repetitions. On day 14 in situ isometric forces of the left soleus and plantaris muscles were measured. Fatigue measurement was performed in only the soleus. Statistical analysis was performed with Sigma Plot using Student's t-test or ANOVA where appropriate. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There was no significant change in animal body mass between treatments. The physiological cross sectional area (PCSA) of the plantaris increased with combined insulin and exercise.

Strategies to enhance the regenerative potential of dysfunctional kidneys, may delay or reverse organ fibrosis. While mesenchymal stem cell therapy can improve acute kidney injury, it has little effect on fibrosis. Reversal of detrimental redox states in fibrotic tissues may be necessary to fully harness the regenerative potential of these cells and to inhibit myofibroblasts which receive differentiative cues based on cell redox state. We have previously observed low level light laser therapy of 635, 532, and 405nm wavelengths to synergize with MSC in enhancing angiogenesis and reducing apopotosis. We hypothesized the pro-regenerative effects observed would correlate with an improved redox state and tested representatives of various redox pathways. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Unilateral ureteral obstruction was used to induce fibrosis; C57BL6 fibrotic kidneys were treated in vivo with either vehicle control, or thrice weekly Low Level Light tri- Laser Therapy (635nm, 532nm, and 405 nm) with or without   weekly intravenous MSC treatment for 4 weeks. For analyses, kidneys were explanted, histologically examined for quantity of fibrosis and apoptosis and expression of the following pathways implicated in redox signaling were quantitated using Q-PCR: superoxide generating oxidases, ie, NOX 1 and NOX 4, Cystathionine-&beta;-synthase(CBS) and cystathionine-&gamma;-lyase(CSE), which produce reactive sulfur species critical to normal mitochondrial function, NRF 1 and NRF 2 which encode anti-oxidative enzyme genes through the anti-oxidant response element (ARE), peroxiredoxins, (PRDX) which catalyze the reduction of peroxides, and SIRTUINS and HIF, which are implicated in cell signaling and survival but dependent on NAD+ as key players in the fibrosis sequence.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Compared to UUO alone, gene expressions of superoxide generators NOX1 and NOX4, respectively, were decreased by 0.72 and 0.8 times in the MSC alone group,and  0.2 and 0.5 times in the tri-laser plus MSC treatment group.

This study sought to investigate the effect of daily clonidine administration on BM dysfunction in a combined lung contusion (LC), hemorrhagic shock (HS), and chronic stress (CS) rodent model. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=4-6/group) were subjected to CS, LCHS, and LCHS/CS &plusmn; daily clonidine (75ug/kg). Animals underwent two hours of daily restraint stress until the day of sacrifice (day 7).  BM cellularity and growth of BM CFU-GEMM, BFU-E and CFU-E colonies were assessed. Peripheral blood was analyzed for hemoglobin (Hgb) and flow cytometry for mobilization of HPCs (CD71<sup>+</sup>CD117<sup>+</sup>). Data was presented as mean&plusmn;SD; *p&lt;0.05 vs. untreated counterpart by t-test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Seven days after LCHS alone, BM cellularity and CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-E growth remains 10-15% suppressed as compare to na&iuml;ve (Table). With the addition of clonidine, BM cellularity improved by 19% and BFU-E and CFU-E colony growth was restored to na&iuml;ve levels. In the more severe and clinically relevant model of LCHS/CS, after seven days there is a 27% suppression of BM cellularity and persistent anemia. Daily administration of clonidine following LCHS/CS resulted in a 26% improvement in BM cellularity and a significant recovery in BM CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-E colony growth by 16, 37, and 32% (Table). Furthermore, the use of clonidine following LCHS/CS led to an 85% decrease in HPC mobilization to the peripheral blood and significantly improved Hgb (13.9&plusmn;0.5* vs. 10.6&plusmn;0.8 g/dL).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Following lung contusion, hemorrhagic shock, and chronic stress, the use of clonidine increased BM cellularity, prevented prolonged suppression of BM HPC growth, reduced mobilization of HPC, and improved anemia. Clonidine has been shown to be protective by reducing the sympathetic effects on BM function following trauma and chronic stress. Therefore, reduction of the prolonged hypercatecholamine state following trauma is therapeutic goal that is beneficial for BM function.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

Poor outcomes are attributed to immune dysregulation and susceptibility to nosocomial infection. Sepsis produces a TH1 to TH2 immune shift associated with poor outcomes. The specific impact of theTH1 to TH2 shift on immune function is unknown. We investigate the timing and impact of the TH1 to TH2 response on immune function. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: C57Bl/6 mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (LD<sub>10</sub>) or sham procedure. Plasma cytokine measurements were taken over 10 days. On days 3 and 7 post sepsis, baseline antibody production was measured. Mice were immunized with NP-KLH. T-cell dependent B-cell class-switching and antigen-specific immunoglobulin production were measured. On day 3 or 7 TH1 and TH2 functions were tested by inoculating mice with a lethal dose of L. monocytogens or P. aeruginosa. Spleen and liver were evaluated for bacterial colonization. At days 3 and 7 post sepsis mice were euthanized, and spleen and bone marrow monocyte number and function assessed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:TH1 (IFN, GM-CSF, TNF, IL-2, IL-12p40, IL-3, IL12p70) and TH2 (IL-4, GM-CSF, IL-5, IL-10, IL-6, IL-13) cytokines were elevated in a biphasic pattern. T-cell dependent B-cell class-switching and antigen-specific production showed equivalent increases in both TH1 and TH2 antibody subtypes. Septic mice eradicated and survived lethal Listeriosis at both 3 and 7 days post sepsis while sham and control mice did not. Mice treated with lethal Pseudomonas on day 3 post sepsis died, whereas mice treated on day 7 preferentially survived. After sepsis mice were able to eradicate Listeria from the spleen and bone marrow, but not Pseudomonas form the lung. Monocyte phagocytic function was greatly increased in CLP vs sham mice.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The data indicate that sepsis produces both functional TH1 and TH2 immune responses. There is a transient deficit in the TH2 immunity early after sepsis that may contribute to nosocomial infection development.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

Currently there are no blood, urine or radiological tests that provide a definitive diagnosis of AMI. The aim of this study was to evaluate if intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), especially detected in urine, can predict AMI in patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Eighteen patients referred to the Acute Care Surgery service at University of Alberta Hospital with suspected AMI taken to the operating room for definitive diagnosis, were recruited. Pathological findings from surgical specimens confirmed gold standard diagnosis for intestinal ischemia. The patients found to be non-ischemic became the internal controls. ELISAs for I-FABP and IL-6 were done on blood and urine samples collected at the time of surgery.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Ten patients were diagnosed with AMI while 8 patients were non-ischemic. There was no difference in age or gender between ischemic and non-ischemic patients (65+21 vs. 53+17 years old, respectively;  4 females with no ischemia and 5 females in the ischemic group). Additionally, there was no difference in serum lactate and creatinine between the 2 groups. Serum IL-6 levels in patients with AMI were significantly higher than non-ischemic controls (0.6+0.2 ng/mL vs. 0.08+0.04 ng/mL, respectively, p&lt;0.006). There was an increase in serum I-FABP in AMI patients, though it was not statistically significant compared to internal controls (11+4 ng/mL vs. 1.9+0,6 ng/mL, respectively, p=0.06). Alternatively, urine I-FABP was significantly higher in patients diagnosed with AMI than in controls (8.7+1.4 ng/mL vs. 2.5+0.7 ng/mL, respectively, p&lt;0.002). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) illustrated that urine I-FABP does discriminate between patients with AMI and controls (area under ROC=0.9, p&lt;0.003).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  The traditional clinical marker, lactate, was not able to differentiate AMI from non-ischemic bowel. However, we found that urine I-FABP can be used as a non-invasive biomarker with high specificity and sensitivity for accurately diagnosing AMI in patients. A non-invasive accurate tool for AMI would facilitate a rapid treatment, while preventing unnecessary surgical interventions in high-risk patient populations.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

Aberrant synaptogenesis, however, can lead to circuit reorganization which is thought to manifest as persistent neurological dysfunction.  In rodents, circuit reorganization in the thalamocortical circuit leads to the development of late-onset sensory sensitivity to whisker stimulation; similar to light/sound hypersensitivity in TBI survivors. Developmental synaptogenesis is, in part, stimulated by astrocyte-secreted thrombospondin-1 and 2 (TSP) via interaction with the &alpha;2&delta;-1 subunit on neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels (&alpha;2&delta;-1). TSP levels are high during development, but diminish with age. After focal trauma in rodent models, TSP levels increase and experimental TSP antagonism decreases epileptiform activity. We, therefore, hypothesize that TBI-induced TSP expression will coincide with circuit reorganization in the thalamocortical circuit. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sham or moderate midline fluid percussion brain injury. At multiple time points over 2-months post-injury, expression of TSPs and synaptic markers were quantified from thalamocortical circuit biopsies using qPCR and automated capillary westerns, respectively. Tissue sections were stained for glial acidic fibrillary protein and processed using silver and Golgi staining. GFAP and silver pixel density were quantified over time in cortical and thalamic regions. Golgi stained neurons were 3D reconstructed and analyzed for neuronal process length, number and surface area with Neurolucida software. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In the thalamus, TSP-1 gene and protein expression significantly increases 7 days post-injury (DPI). Gene and protein expression of &alpha;2&delta;-1, pre- and post-synaptic markers also significantly change over time. In the cortex, TSP-1 gene expression increases at 7 DPI which coincides with significant changes of expression of &alpha;2&delta;-1, pre- and post-synaptic markers. Protein analysis of the cortex is still on going.  Histologically, there is increasing neuronal pathology and astrocytosis at 7 DPI. Neuronal process length, number, and complexity also differ significantly from shams in both relays over time. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Changes in synaptogenic and synaptic marker expression, pathology and neuronal morphology coincide with the development of late-onset of symptoms. This supports post-TBI reparative events leading to aberrant synaptogenesis and circuit reorganization resulting in neurological dysfunction. Persistent astrocytosis after TBI provides a source of the increased expression of TSP, which likely mediates synaptogenesis and ongoing events. Understanding the unique time course and mechanism of chronic neurological dysfunction after TBI is critical to development of treatment strategies.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

Coopersmith<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Emory University,Surgery,Atlanta, GA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Changes in intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis and proliferation have been associated with mortality in animal models of sepsis, and preventing gut cell death by local overexpression of Bcl-2 has repeatedly been shown to increase survival. However, our unpublished observations indicate that when anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 is overexpressed in conjunction with the pro-proliferative transgene SV40 T-antigen, the epithelium is not protected from sepsis-induced apoptosis, but instead displays a paradoxical increase in cell death. We here attempt to shed light on this phenomenon by examining mechanisms of cell death in the gut of septic Bcl2xTAg animals.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Fabpi-Bcl2 mice were crossed to fabpl-TAg mice to produce bi-transgenic Bcl2xTAg mice with small intestinal enterocyte-specific overexpression of Bcl-2 and SV40 T-antigen. Mice aged 8-10 weeks old were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and sacrificed at 24 hours.  Jejunal sections were collected at time of sacrifice for western blot analysis. Septic Bcl2xTAg mice were compared to septic TAg mice to determine how the additional expression of Bcl-2 might lead to the increased cell death seen in Bcl2xTAg enterocytes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Septic Bcl2xTAg mice expressed the Bcl-2 protein at a concentration 4.1-fold greater than septic TAg controls (p=0.001, n=9-10). Expression of the apoptosis effector caspase-3 was significantly increased in these animals (3.1-fold increase, p=0.017, n=5-6). Bcl2xTAg mice also displayed increased expression of caspase-9 (24.5-fold increase, p=0.005, n=7-9) and caspase-8 (1.8-fold increase, p=0.013, n=9-10), suggesting both intrinsic and extrinsic signaling upstream of caspase-3 activation. These changes were associated with trends in increased concentrations of the mitochondrial apoptosis mediators Bax (8.9-fold increase, p=0.051, n=9-11) and cytochrome C (2.0-fold increase, p=0.052, n-5-6), but not apoptosis inducing factor (1.06-fold increase, p=0.65, n=5-6).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The overexpression of Bcl-2 in the gut of Bcl2xTAg mice paradoxically results in increased sensitivity to sepsis-induced enterocyte apoptosis by both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. The greatly increased caspase-9 expression suggests the intrinsic pathway may predominate. Overexpression of an anti-apoptotic factor, when coupled with overexpression of a pro-proliferative factor, may trigger a counter compensatory response that increases the likelihood of cell death rather than survival.","Basic Science","Ischemia/Reperfusion/Injury Response","Trauma/Critical Care"

In light of the immune dysregulation seen in sepsis, the effect of CIRP on the innate and adaptive immune response of T cells is an area of interest that has not yet been characterized. Here, we hypothesized that extracellular CIRP activates splenic T cells via a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent mechanism and promotes a proinflammatory Th1 response.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and TLR4 knockout (TLR4KO) mice received intravenous (IV) injection of recombinant murine CIRP (rmCIRP, 5 mg/kg BW) or PBS (vehicle). At 20 h after injection, splenocytes were isolated, labeled, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The early T cell activation marker CD25 was used to identify activated T cells. CD4 T cells isolated from the spleens of WT and TLR4KO mice were incubated on anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated plates with or without rmCIRP (1 &micro;g/ml) for 20 h, followed by flow cytometry or PCR array analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: After rmCIRP injection in WT mice, the CD25<sup>+ </sup>CD4 T cell population was increased 4.1-fold compared to PBS; however, there was no significant change in the number of CD25<sup>+ </sup>CD4 T cells in TLR4KO mice (Table). Furthermore, incubation of WT CD4 T cells with rmCIRP and CD3/CD28 co-stimulation increased the population of CD25<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells by 11% compared to PBS control. In contrast, CD4 T cells isolated from TLR4KO mice showed a decreased percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells with rmCIRP incubation (Table). Additionally, an 84-gene Th1 &amp; Th2 response PCR array (QIAGEN) showed significant upregulation of seven genes in CD4 T cells treated with rmCIRP compared to PBS control (n=3, P &lt; 0.05). Of these, four were Th1-related genes; interferon-&gamma;, interleukin 12 receptor beta 2, T-bet and colony stimulating factor 2 were increased 7.1-, 5.3-, 3.7- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Two CD4 T cell markers, interleukin 6  and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, were increased 3.9- and 2.9-fold, respectively. Lastly, the Th2 cytokine interleukin 13 was increased 3.7-fold. No genes were downregulated.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our findings demonstrate that CIRP activates T cells via a TLR4-dependent mechanism.

It remains unknown whether the different types of HDACIs differ in their cytoprotective potential. Here we used an in vitro model of hypoxia/ reoxygenation (H/R) to assess whether different HDACIs, such as SAHA (pan), MS-275 (class I), MC-1568 (class IIa), Tubastatin-A (Tub-A, class IIb), and EX-527 (class III), could protect the cardiomyocytes from injury. The most effective agent was also subjected to a mechanistic study.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Experiment I: H9c2 cardiomyocytes from ATCC were subjected to an in vitro model of H/R (12/8 hours), and treated with or without SAHA, MS-275, MC-1568, Tub-A, or EX-527. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), an indicator of cellular toxicity, in cell culture media was detected by a LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit. The levels of acetylated histone H3 and acetylated &alpha;-tubulin were measured by Western blots. Experiment II: Tub-A was chosen for further investigation to analyze the underlying protective mechanisms. Cultured H9c2 cells were randomly divided into Sham control, H/R, and H/R+Tub-A groups. Expression of phospho-Akt (p-Akt)/Akt, phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR)/mTOR, phospho-p70s6k (p-p70s6k), phospho-rpS6 (p-rpS6)/rpS6 proteins were determined by Western blots. In addition, the changes in expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II, a marker of autophagy, were assessed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: High levels of acetylated histone H3 were detected in all of the HDACI treated-groups, while acetylated &alpha;-tubulin were only seen in Tub-A or SAHA treated-groups.

Velazquez<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Miami,Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is induced on inflamed endothelial cells (iEC) under several pathological conditions, such as atherosclerosis and inflammation. Integrin LFA-1 recognizes ICAM-1 as its ligand, and the I-domain of LFA-1 (idLFA-1) is responsible for bind to ICAM-1. idLFA-1/ICAM-1 pair is thus an attractive target for delivery of therapeutic cells to tissues where iEC are presented. We are aimed to develop a safe and targeted cell delivery method for therapeutic administration of stem/progenitor cells, which carry repair function, to atherosclerotic lesion to stave off the development of atherosclerosis. We have recently developed a novel cell delivery platform by coating the surface of the cells to be delivered with nanocarriers composed of nanoparticle&ndash;adhesion molecule complex. These nanocarriers guide the coated cells to their destination via  recognition and association with their counterpart adhesion molecules, which are highly or selectively expressed on the diseased tissue, and execute their therapeutic roles. Here, we tested effectiveness of idLFA-1 complexed nanocarriers in mediating interaction of nanocarrier-coated endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to iEC in vitro. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Recombinant human idLFA-1 protein was denatured, refolded, and purified by gel filtration. Binding activity of idLFA-1 to ICAM-1 was validated by testing association of FITC-conjugated idLFA-1 with human aorta endothelial cells (HAEC) pre-transduced with Notch1<sup>IC</sup>/lentivirus to induce high ICAM-1 (ICAM-1<sup>hi</sup>) expression. Nanocarriers were created by conjugation of idLFA-1 with dendrimers. Human EPC were labeled by transduction with DsRed/Lentivirus.

HAEC transduced with Notch1<sup>IC</sup>/lentivirus are 'inflamed' since expression of ICAM-1 along with a panel of inflammatory citokines, including IL-1&alpha;, IL-6, IL-8 and RANTES, are elevated significantly.

All-trans retinoic acid (atRA) has many beneficial effects on the vasculature, including inhibition of proliferation. We previously demonstrated that localized delivery of atRA through a poly (1,8) octamethylene citrate (POC) periadventitial membrane significantly reduced neointimal hyperplasia after carotid balloon injury in rats. The objective of this study was to develop an atRA-POC coated ePTFE graft and evaluate the biocompatibility and efficacy of this graft in the vasculature. We hypothesize that atRA-POC ePTFE grafts will be biocompatible and inhibit intimal formation after aortic interposition grafting in rats as compared to standard ePTFE grafts.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  To evaluate biocompatibility ex vivo, compliance was evaluated via compression testing, platelet aggregation was evaluated using plasma from Sprague Dawley rats (n=3), and complement activation was assessed using human serum (n=3). To establish efficacy and biocompatibility in vivo, an aortic interposition bypass was performed on 12-week-old Sprague Dawley rats. Treatment groups included ePTFE (n=6), POC ePTFE (n=7), atRA ePTFE (n=6) and atRA-POC ePTFE (n=6).  At 28 days the grafts with 1 cm of native aorta and blood were collected. Morphometric analysis was performed on H&amp;E stained cross sections using ImageJ software. Analysis was performed on collected blood samples to evaluate renal and liver function.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: All 3 grafts (POC, atRA, and atRA-POC) ePTFE exhibited similar compliance as compared to standard ePTFE grafts. There were no differences in platelet aggregation or complement activation between the treatment groups. Rats who received the atRA-POC ePTFE grafts were found to have 40% less intimal formation at the proximal graft anastomosis and 56% less intimal formation at the distal graft anastomosis compared to control ePTFE grafts (P&lt;0.03). atRA ePTFE grafts resulted in a 53% decrease in intimal formation at the distal graft anastomosis compared to ePTFE control (P&lt; 0.01); however, atRA ePTFE grafts did not reduce intimal formation at the proximal graft anastomosis. There were no clinically significant differences in the liver function tests and renal chemistries between treatment groups.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: atRA-POC ePTFE grafts resulted in less intimal formation at both the proximal and distal graft anastomoses compared to ePTFE grafts.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the targeting specificity, cellular binding, and internalization patterns of a novel synthetically engineered targeted delivery vehicle that can subsequently be designed to deliver a therapeutic agent to prevent arterial restenosis.  Our hypothesis is that the targeted gold nanoparticle will bind with specificity to the site of arterial injury and demonstrate cellular binding and internalization to the cells that comprise the vascular wall.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A citrate-stabilized 13 nm gold nanoparticle (AuNP) was surface functionalized with a molecular fluorophore and a collagen-binding peptide (CBP) or a scrambled peptide (SCR).  In vivo assessment of targeting specificity was accomplished utilizing the rat carotid artery balloon injury model in 10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats.  After balloon angioplasty of the left carotid artery, systemic injection of the AuNP into the inferior vena cava was performed with either the CBP-AuNP (15-60 nM, n=14) or the SCR-AuNP (30-60 nM, n=7).  Arteries were harvested 20 minutes post injection.  Binding was detected using fluorescent microscopy.  The right carotid artery served as the control (n=21).  In vitro determination of cellular binding and internalization was performed on rat aortic endothelial cells (EC), adventitial fibroblasts (AF), and smooth muscle cells (SMC) exposed to 50 nM of the AuNP.  Fluorescent uptake was quantified at 4 and 24 hours using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader.  Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA on Ranks.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In vivo, the collagen-targeted CBP-AuNP bound to the site of arterial injury and brightly fluoresced, with the most prominent signal at 45 nM.  No binding was noted to the contralateral, uninjured right carotid artery.  Rats injected with the SCR-AuNP expressed no fluorescent signal in either the right or left carotid arteries.  In vitro, the AuNP bound to all three cell types and fluorescence significantly increased over time (EC p&lt;0.001, AF p&lt;0.001, SMC p&lt;0.001), suggesting internalization within the cell.  Among the three cell types, the greatest fluorescence was noted with EC (2.0-fold increase vs. 1.6-fold AF and 1.3-fold SMC at 24 hours).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our collagen-targeted AuNP binds with specificity to the site of vascular injury and demonstrates binding to and internalization within the cells that comprise the vascular wall.

The underlying cause is smooth muscle cell (SMC) pathophysiology characterized by proliferation, migration and dedifferentiation. Apicidin, a class I histone deacetylase (HDAC3) inhibitor, has been shown to have a potent anti-proliferative effect in a number of cancers. The mechanism of its effect appears to be through activation of the tumor suppressor factor P53. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Apicidin in preventing recurrent stenosis after vascular reconstruction.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  In vitro assays included proliferation (CellTiter-Glo), migration (scratch assay), and western blotting. In vivo analysis was conducted using a rat model of carotid balloon angioplasty.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Rat SMCs were pretreated (2 hours) with Apicidin and then stimulated with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) for 72 hours followed by measurement of proliferation. Based upon an initial dose response curve, we found the optimal concentration of Apicidin to be 500nM, which reduced proliferation by 72.9% &plusmn; 5.3% (p &lt; 0.05).  Pretreatment of SMCs with Apicidin also reduced SMC migration by 77.1% &plusmn; 2.0% (p &lt; 0.01) at 24 hours in response to 10% FBS. We have previously shown that the combination of TGF-&beta;/Smad3 is a potent stimulant of SMC dedifferentiation. To evaluate whether Apicidin can reverse this effect and promote differentiation, SMCs transfected with Smad3 were pretreated for 2 hours with Apicidin and then stimulated with TGF-&beta; (10ng/mL) for 48 hours. Reduction of several proteins indicative of SMC differentiation by TGF-&beta;/Smad3 was rescued by Apicidin by the following percentages: Calponin (22.3%), Myosin Heavy Chain (108.9%), and Smooth Muscle Actin (30.0%). Blots were re-probed for levels of acetylated histone, which were increased 14.3 &plusmn; 2.1 fold (p &lt; 0.05), confirming the expected function of the HDAC inhibitor. Finally, adult rats underwent carotid balloon angioplasty with periadventitial application of Apicidin (500&micro;g) in 23% pluronic gel. Cross-sectional carotid samples were harvested at 21 days, yielding preliminary results indicating that Apicidin reduces neointimal area by 55% while preserving luminal and vessel integrity.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The HDAC3 inhibitor, Apicidin, can reduce SMC proliferation and migration, promote SMC differentiation, and subsequently lead to a significant reduction in intimal hyperplasia. Inhibition of HDAC3 could be an effective therapeutic intervention for the prevention of recurrent stenosis leading to improved long-term outcomes in patients treated for vascular disease.","Basic Science","Endothelial/Vascular Physiology","Vascular"

We have previously shown that there is a distinct temporal regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components during AVF maturation.  CD44 is a widely expressed cellular adhesion molecule that serves as a major receptor for ECM components such as hyaluronic acid as well as promoting adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells and stimulating smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration.  We hypothesized that CD44 promotes wall thickening and ECM deposition during AVF maturation by promoting inflammation in the maturing vein.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Aortocaval fistulae were performed by needle puncture in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J and CD44 knockout (KO) mice.  AVF diameter was serially assessed weekly by duplex ultrasound.  AVF were harvested at days 7 or 21 and histology analyzed using computerized morphometry, as well as qRT-PCR and Western blot.  In both WT and CD44 KO mice, after AVF formation, microspheres containing MCP-1 were placed over the adventitia using a pluronic gel.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:CD44 expression was increased 2.1-fold in AVF (day 7).  CD44 KO mice showed reduced AVF wall thickness (8.9 &mu;m vs. 26.8 &mu;m; p = 0.0114, ANOVA), collagen density (1.7 fold; p = 0.0186, ANOVA), and hyaluronic acid density (2.6 fold; p = 0.0004, ANOVA), but similar elastin density (p = 0.9315) when compared to control AVF (day 21).  CD44 KO mice also showed reduced VCAM-1 expression (12.0 fold; p = 0.0092, ANOVA), ICAM-1 expression (30.5 fold; p = 0.0002, ANOVA ), and MCP-1 expression (11.4 fold; p = 0.0006, ANOVA) in the AVF compared to control AVF; there were also reduced M2 macrophage markers (TGM2: 81.5 fold; p = 0.0001, ANOVA and IL-10: 7.6 fold; p = 0.0228, ANOVA) in CD44 KO mice.  Delivery of MCP-1 to the AVF in WT mice resulted in thicker AVF walls (32.0 &mu;m vs. 24.5 &mu;m; p = 0.0383, t-test), increased collagen density (1.6 fold; p = 0.0184, t-test), and increased number of M2 macrophages (1.5 fold; p = 0.0241, t-test).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:CD44 promotes accumulation of M2 macrophages, ECM deposition and inflammation, enhancing AVF maturation.  These data suggest that promoting CD44 activity may be a strategy to enhance AVF maturation, and also show the importance of inflammation to enable wall thickening during AVF maturation.","Basic Science","Endothelial/Vascular Physiology","Vascular"

We have previously shown that stimulation of Eph-B4 in vein grafts prevents wall thickening during venous remodeling.  Since Akt-1 is a downstream mediator of Eph-B4 signaling in endothelial cells, we hypothesized that Akt-1 mediates Eph-B4 function during AVF maturation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The infrarenal aorto-caval AVF model was created in wild type C57BL/6 mice and Akt-1 knockout mice as previously described. To stimulate Eph-B4 activity, mice were treated with either EphrinB2/Fc (20 &mu;g IP) or a control vehicle at 48 hr intervals over a 21 day study period. Fistula maturation was monitored with weekly ultrasound measurements; AVF were harvested at day 21 and infrarenal IVC wall thickness was measured using computerized morphometry. Eph-B4 and Akt-1 expression were measured with immunofluorescence. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In WT mice, Eph-B4 expression increased 4.6-fold in the vein after AVF surgery compared to veins that had a sham operation (p=0.007, t-test). Stimulation of Eph-B4 in WT mice resulted in increased merged Eph-B4 and phospho-tyrosine signal (60% vs 92%; p=0.04, t-test) as well as an 8.2-fold increase in phospho-Akt-1 signal (p=0.04, t-test). Eph-B4 stimulation in WT mice was associated with reduced fistula diameter (45% vs. 98.6%; p&lt;0.05, ANOVA) and reduced fistula wall thickness (8.9&mu;m vs. 20.0&mu;m; p=0.0261, t-test).  However, in Akt-1 KO mice, Eph-B4 stimulation resulted in no change in fistula diameter (38% vs 22%; p=0.09, ANOVA) and no change in fistula wall thickness (15.3 vs 17&mu;m; p=0.46, t-test). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Although Eph-B4 expression is increased in an AVF, Eph-B4 in the AVF is not phosphorylated.  However, stimulation of Eph-B4 increases the percentage of phosphorylated Eph-B4 that appears to be active with reduced fistula diameter and wall thickness. Akt-1 knockout abolishes the effects of Eph-B4 stimulation on wall thickness and diameter suggesting that Akt-1 mediates the effect of Eph-B4 on venous adaptation to the arterial environment.","Basic Science","Endothelial/Vascular Physiology","Vascular"

Metabolic syndrome exacerbates exercise intolerance in PAD due to impaired circulation and metabolism. The diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse provides a robust model of humans at risk for PAD and diabetes. This study evaluated the expression of growth factors, cytokine signaling pathways, and regulators of adipocyte differentiation in DIO mice in the setting of DI.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  DIO C57BL6 mice underwent unilateral femoral artery ligation followed by two weeks recovery. Mice were then randomized into two groups. The first group (n=8) was subjected to 1hr of daily treadmill exercise (12m/min, 10&deg; incline) for 4 weeks to induce DI, and a parallel group (n=7) remained sedentary (SI) for 4 weeks. Hindlimb muscles were examined histologically for capillary density (CD31 immunohistochemistry) and muscle cross sectional area (CSA). Hindlimb skeletal muscles were analyzed for the levels of the pro-angiogenic cytokines G-CSF and VEGF using multiplex assay while the phosphorylation of the signaling transduction molecules, pSTAT3 and pERK1/2 and the brown adipocyte marker uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) levels were measured by western blotting. Real-time qPCR analysis was used to assess gene expression of the energy metabolism transcription factor PGC1-&alpha;. Statistical analysis was performed with student t-test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: (see table) Exercise significantly enhanced capillary density (p=0.0086) and markedly lowered CSA (p=0.0012) in DI muscle compared to SI. These findings were paralleled by a significant increase in G-CSF (p= 0.0006) and pSTAT3 (p=0.0114) protein levels as well as enhanced PGC1-&alpha; (p= 0.014) gene expression. There was no difference in the pERK1/2 (p=0.23) or VEGF (p=0.2) protein levels between the two groups. Furthermore, DI muscle had significantly diminished UCP-1 protein levels compared to SI muscle.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: These data suggest that  DI enhances capillary density but lowers muscle CSA. Since VEGF and ERK1/2 levels were not different between DI and SI muscles, the enhanced capillary density may be primarily dependent on G-CSF and STAT3 signaling pathway after 4 weeks of DI. Exercise also appears to modulate adipogenic differentiation and muscle energy metabolism, evident by the decrease in UCP-1 protein and increase in PGC1-&alpha; gene expression. Ongoing regular exercise in patients with PAD is important to augment microvascular perfusion and decrease fatty degeneration, thereby enhancing muscle adaptation to ameliorate claudication and improve limb function.","Basic Science","Endothelial/Vascular Physiology","Vascular"

However, the cell-type responsible for this protective effect has not been elucidated. In other experimental models, platelet-derived TLR4 has been shown to a mediator of damage, possibly through expression of the platelet activation marker P-selectin. We therefore hypothesized that platelet-specific TLR4 similarly mediates inflammation from muscle hypoxia, and that targeted deletion of TLR4 in platelets is protective in limb ischemia.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Targeted deletion of TLR4 was performed using Cre-Lox site-specific recombinase technology. To generate endothelial cell, platelet and myeloid specific TLR4 knockout mice, TLR4-floxed mice were bred with VE-cadherein-Cre (VEC), platelet-factor 4-Cre (PF4) and LysM-Cre(LysM) mice, respectively. Homozygous mutation was confirmed using PCR. In cell-specific TLR4KO as well as TLR4-floxed (control) mice, femoral artery ligation (FAL) was performed on the right hindlimb, while vessels were exposed without ligation on the left. Perfusion was assessed at baseline, 1, 7 and 14 days after FAL using Laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI). IL-6 ELISA levels 6 hours after FAL were measured from control and PF4-TLR4KO mice. Platelets from control and global TLR4KO mice were isolated from whole blood and activated with buffer, LPS (TLR4 agonist), Pam3CSK4 (TLR2 agonist), HMGB1 (TLR2 and TLR4 agonist) or thrombin (0.25U), and subjected to flow cytometry to assess P-selectin expression.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: FAL uniformly resulted in significant, unilateral ischemia.  Two weeks after FAL, platelet-specific TLR4KO mice (PF4) demonstrated more perfusion recovery compared to endothelial cell specific (VEC) or myeloid specific (LysM) TLR4KO mice (Figure 1, p&lt;0.02; N=5-8/group; ANOVA).  PF4-TLR4KO mice had less serum IL-6 levels compared with controls six hours after FAL (p&lt;0.03, N=3-5/group;t-test). Platelets from control and global TLR4KO mice responded to treatment with thrombin and Pam3CSK4 with increased P-selectin expression. However, when exposed to either LPS or HMGB1, platelet P-Selectin expression did not increase significantly over baseline.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: As opposed to myeloid and endothelial cells, platelet sources of TLR4 negatively mediated perfusion recovery following FAL, promoting release of IL-6 after injury.  However, platelets with functional TLR4 did not respond to traditional TLR4 agonists with P-selectin expression. Thus, the mechanism for a protective effect of platelet &ndash;specific TLR4 deletion in muscle ischemia may be P-selectin independent.","Basic Science","Endothelial/Vascular Physiology","Vascular"

These complications of diabetes are known to be major factors in the development of chronic diabetic foot ulcers and non-traumatic limb amputation. This study investigates gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, its receptor CXCR1 and IL-6) and neuropeptide receptors (NPY receptors, NPY2R and NPY5R and Substance P receptor, NK1R) in a diabetic rabbit neuroischemic wound healing model.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  New Zealand White rabbits received saline or alloxan monohydrate for the induction of diabetes. 30 days post-alloxan or saline all rabbits underwent wound procedure. In all rabbits, the central and rostral, arteries and nerves in one ear were ligated and resected to induce neuroischemia while in the other ear, arteries and nerves were left intact (sham).  Four 6mm full thickness wounds were created in both ears. Rabbits were euthanized at two or ten days post-surgery and wounds were harvested. To confirm diabetes, blood glucose (BG) levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were monitored. Rabbits with BG over 250mg/dL and HbA1c levels above 6.5 were considered diabetic.  Wound size (% of original wound) was monitored in the 10-day group using computerized planimetry. Using Q-RT-PCR, gene expression was compared between the skin of non-diabetic and diabetic rabbits. Change in gene expression within the sham and neuroischemic wounds (D2 or D10) relative to skin (D0) were also measured and comparisons were made between non-diabetic and diabetic rabbits.  All measurements are presented as mean&plusmn;SEM. N= 3-6 rabbits.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Compared to non-diabetic rabbits, rabbits treated with alloxan had higher BG and HbA1C levels on the day of surgery  (112&plusmn;5.16 mg/dL and 4.65&plusmn;0.18 vs. 289&plusmn;22.6 mg/dL and 7.3&plusmn;0.36).

Grant summary descriptions were reviewed by two investigators and categorized by research methodology (basic science or translational, clinical trials, outcomes, and other). Principal investigator specialty training and academic position at the time of funding was determined through the RePORTER database and through online academic biographies. Institutions were ranked by number of grants funded. Categorical comparisons between 2013 and 2003 were assessed using Fisher's Exact test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Between 2003 and 2013, the total number of grants awarded diminished by 19% (512 vs 613).

Online prices were substantially lower than manufacturers, with a per-lab savings of: $1779.26 (suturing), $1752.52 (chest tube), $2448.52 (anastomosis), and $1891.64 (laparoscopic), resulting in a per-year savings of $47,285.  A general linear model and pairwise comparisons of satisfaction scores was completed, and p-values adjusted using Tukey's adjustment for multiple comparisons.  Satisfaction scores for the skills labs were 4.32, with statistical significance when compared to live lectures at 2.96 (p&lt;0.0001) and small group activities at 3.67 (p&lt;0.0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:A cost-effective approach for design and implementation of surgical skills labs showed substantial savings on a per-lab and per-year basis.  By utilizing online resources to purchase surgical equipment for use in nonhuman settings, surgical educators overcome financial obstacles limiting the use of simulation and provide learning opportunities that medical students perceive as beneficial to their education.","Education","Simulation Training (Technical and Non-technical)","Cross Disciplinary"

Severely injured (ISS&gt;25) children present to freestanding Pediatric Trauma Centers at a relatively low frequency.  Major trauma resuscitations in this setting occur infrequently, and as such, team familiarity is lacking.  Thus, we implemented simulated trauma resuscitations to assess teamwork, confidence, and communication in the trauma bay. We hypothesized that simulated trauma resuscitations would help identify key components of an effective trauma team.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Cross-disciplinary trauma team members were recruited from a free-standing Level I pediatric trauma center in Los Angeles County. A demographic survey was administered to participants, and a semi-structured guide was used to lead the focus group.

Research using motion tracking technology has helped to quantify surgeons&#39; dexterity into performance metrics such as path length, working volume and motion smoothness. This work has successfully shown a difference in these metrics when comparing experts and novices. However, comparing motion metrics with end product quality could provide specific feedback on psychomotor skills and how trainees may improve task completion quality. The purpose of this study is to identify and model the relationship between motion metrics and a quantitative measure of end product quality ('hernia repair score') in a simulated laparoscopic ventral hernia (LVH) repair. We hypothesize that lower values of path length, working volume, and motion smoothness relate to higher hernia repair score.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Surgical residents (PGY 2-3, N = 39) from Midwestern programs performed a simulated LVH repair. During the procedure, three electromagnetic sensors were placed on each hand (thumb, index finger, and wrist). Position data was used to calculate path length, working volume, and motion smoothness during the placement of the first transfacial suture. After the simulation, the hernia repair was rated using a previously validated checklist to score the quality of mesh attachment on a 24-point scale. To prepare the data, a log transform was applied to the motion smoothness data and factor analysis was used to combine metrics from the six sensors into one or two standardized variables. The relationship between these standardized variables and hernia product score was modeled using linear regression.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Multiple regression analysis tested if path length significantly predicted hernia repair score. The results indicated that the path length of the dominant (&beta; = -2.084, p = .021) and non-dominant hand (&beta; = -1.830, p = .040) explained 26.1% of the variance in hernia repair score (R<sup>2</sup> = .261, F(2, 30) = 5.284, p = .011). However, multiple regression analysis showed that working volume did not significantly predict hernia product score (R<sup>2</sup> = .083, F(2, 31) = 1.412, p = .259). A simple regression analysis demonstrated that the log transform of motion smoothness (&beta; = -2.878, p = .001) significantly predicted hernia product score, explaining 28.9% of the variance (R<sup>2</sup> = .289, F(2, 31) = 12.616, p = .001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Regression analyses show that shorter path lengths and smoother movements significantly predict higher hernia repair quality. While the independent variables account for less than 30% of the variance, it is noteworthy that the motion metrics of a single stitch have significant, predictive validity for final product outcomes. While additional work is needed, these findings have significant implications for the potential use of motion tracking in measuring surgical performance.","Education","Simulation Training (Technical and Non-technical)","Cross Disciplinary"

A central tenet in creating competency-based curricula in undergraduate medical education is the development of meaningful assessments of medical student performance.  Therefore, we studied the use of VR to characterize and assess the laparoscopic skills attained in a competency-based curriculum designed for graduating medical students applying for general surgery residency.  Our overall goal is to integrate the milestone competencies for surgery across the educational continuum and document trainee progress toward proficiency.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Seventeen fourth year medical students applying for surgical residency completed a monitored VR training curriculum comprised of camera navigation (CN), hand eye coordination (HEC) and FLS tasks: circle cutting (CC), ligating loop (LL), peg transfer (PT), and intracorporeal knot tying (IKT).  Students completed the curriculum at their own pace over eight weeks.  Performance goals were those of the simulator for CN and HEC tasks and the standard goals given in the FLS instruction manual.  After 8 weeks, students were observed performing FLS tasks.  The best VR performance for each FLS task and the observed performance of the FLS tasks were scored by assigning penalties as described in the FLS instruction manual.  The ability of the VR simulator to detect penalties in each of the FLS tasks and correlations of time taken to complete tasks are reported.  Additional metrics from the VR simulator were examined for correlation to the commission of penalties. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Sixteen students trained in 100% of the curriculum, though no student achieved proficiency in all of the VR modules within eight weeks.  All students were proficient in CN and HEC tasks.  Proficiency was achieved in CC, LL PT and IKT by 15, 12, 15, and 1 student respectively.  VR simulation showed high specificity for predicting zero penalties on the observed CC, LL, and PT tasks (84%, 81%, and 75%).  VR consistently underestimates time for CC, LL, and PT tasks.  The interrater reliability of manual and VR times was highest for PT (r=0.508, p=0.014). The number of movements and dominant hand path length positively correlated with the commission of penalties.  Needle drops, passes, loading time and time needle is out of view did not correlate with penalties for any task.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: VR can be used to monitor and assess medical student acquisition of laparoscopic skills.  The absence of penalties in the simulator reasonably predicts the absence of penalties in manual demonstration of CC, LL and PT skills, but not IKT.  The documented skills acquired by trainees can be transferred to a graduate medical education program for further monitoring of progress toward proficiency.","Education","Simulation Training (Technical and Non-technical)","Cross Disciplinary"

We asked each program to distribute our survey to the female surgical residents who have been pregnant during residency in the last 5 years.  Each program was re-contacted six weeks after the initial contact.  Most questions were in a 5-point Likert scale format.  The responses were collected and analyzed using the Survey Monkey website.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The surveys were sent to 32 general surgery programs and 26 programs responded (81%).  Each program was asked for the total number of possible responses from female residents that met our criteria (60 female residents).

Over half of the residents (55%) were pregnant during their 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> year of residency, with only 18% pregnant during a research year.  The majority of the residents missed elective rotations.  Ninety percent of the program directors were accommodating.  Most of the faculty were very understanding (55%) and continued to educate (81%).  However, 24% of the residents stated that the faculty actually operated with them less.  Half of the residents felt that their medical knowledge and technical skills fell behind that of their fellow residents.  Thirty-one percent had a lower ABSITE score.  Ninety percent of the residents were out 4 weeks or more of maternity leave.  Most of the residents (95%) stated that they would do this again during residency given the opportunity, but many of the residents felt that returning back to work with a child at home was the most difficult part.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: As the female influence in medicine increases, pregnancy and the length of maternity leave may need to be better addressed by the American Board of Surgery and residency programs.

To ease this transition, over 50 medical schools have developed courses to prepare graduating medical students for intern responsibilities. This study aimed to demonstrate that a surgical intern preparatory course (S-IPC) decreases student anxiety pertaining to intern year and that an orientation to a simulation experience improves clinical decision-making while lowering anxiety during the simulation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Nine fourth year medical students who had matched into an ACGME-accredited general surgery internships participated in the two-week S-IPC. The curriculum was instructed in a step-up approach consisting of lecture-based review sessions, hands-on technical skill instruction, small group discussions, high-fidelity clinical decision-making simulations, and a live porcine surgical experience. The students' anxiety levels were measured via a six-question short form of the State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) prior to the course and surrounding the simulations. Simulation confidence levels were also obtained after each session. For the first simulation session, participants were divided into two groups with only one group receiving an orientation to the simulation environment. An attending surgeon evaluated each participant's performance during the simulation using a standardized assessment tool. All students received the same orientation prior to the second simulation session which occurred at the end of the course and was comprised of two case scenarios. Following the course, students were asked to reassess anxiety levels regarding intern year.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Prior to the first simulation, the entire cohort reported a heightened level of state anxiety (M = 2.28 &plusmn; 0.62) when compared to trait scores (M = 1.64 &plusmn; 0.44, Z = &ndash;2.31, p = 0.021) with no significant difference observed between the control and oriented groups.

A common area of concern amongst trainees is the adequacy of open abdominal surgical training.  Truncating the general surgery training component has likely negatively affected the integrated vascular residents' overall exposure to open abdominal surgical cases. However, it is our belief that, although their overall exposure to open abdominal procedures has decreased, integrated vascular residents have a focused, effective exposure to open aortic surgery during training.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  National operative case log data supplied by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education was compiled for both graduating integrated vascular surgery residents and graduating categorical general surgery residents for the years 2012 &ndash; 2014. Mean total and open abdominal case numbers were compared between the vascular and general surgery residents with more in depth exploration into open abdominal procedures by organ system.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, the mean total 5-year case volume of integrated vascular residents was 1430 cases compared to 980 total cases for general surgery residents during the same time frame.   For the vascular residents, this included a mean of 92.2 open abdominal cases compared to 192.1 for general surgery residents.  68% of the open abdominal experience for vascular residents was focused on procedures involving the aorta and its branches with an average of 62.3 open aortic cases throughout their training. The remaining open abdominal cases were accumulated during their general surgery rotations.  98% of the general surgery residents' open abdominal experience involved non-vascular abdominal surgery spread over 10 different organ systems including an average of 12.1 (6%) pancreatic cases, 12.9 hepatic cases (7%), 62 large intestine cases (32%), and only 4.4 open aortic procedures (2%). Open aortic surgery comprises an average of 9.1% of the total major vascular cases for the vascular residents, whereas open alimentary tract-large intestinal surgery at 6.2% comprises the largest proportion for the average general surgery resident experience.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Integrated vascular surgery residents graduate with less than half of the overall open abdominal surgical case numbers when compared with concurrent graduating general surgery residents.  General surgery residents' open abdominal exposure is divided across 10 separate organ systems with small numbers in high complexity areas like hepatobiliary procedures and an inadequate exposure to aortic procedures.

We assessed operative leadership skills and conducted a survey evaluation of residents' perception of skills decay and prediction of task difficulty. The purpose was to compare residents' perception of technical skill decay and difficulty with their leadership skills during a simulated bowel repair. Leadership was assessed by the resident's ability to direct their assistant. We hypothesize that resident's ratings of difficulty and expected skill decay will be correlated to their utilization of the operative assistant during the simulation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Surgical residents (PGY 2-4) in their research years were given 15 minutes to perform a simulated bowel repair. Prior to the procedure, residents were given a survey to rate their perceived difficulty and expected skill decay in performing the repair. The procedure consisted of a simulated gunshot wound to the abdomen that left one small and large full thickness injuries to the anti-mesenteric border of the small bowel. Residents were asked to repair the injuries with an operative assistant. The assistant was instructed not to provide feedback on the repair; however, could clarify with prefixed responses what was expected of the resident. Interactions with the assistant were coded by a researcher using Transana<sup>TM</sup> coding software to identify the total number of directional instructions given by the resident during the simulation. Correlations between the number of directional instructions and perceived skill decay and task difficulty were performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-eight residents (55.3% female) participated in the study. Residents provided 3-40 (M=13.96, SD=9.90) directional instructions to the operative assistant during the procedure. Residents who expected to have less decay in their small bowel repair skills during their research time were able to utilize the assistant more by giving them more directions on how to assist during the repair (R<sup>2</sup>=-.468, p=.016, df = 26). Those who perceived more difficulty on the repair and its related steps gave fewer directional instructions to their assistant. Expected procedural difficulties included selecting the correct suture (R<sup>2</sup>=-.401, p=.042, df = 26), selecting the correct stitch (R<sup>2</sup>=-.361, p=.070, df = 26), and successfully performing the entire surgical task (R<sup>2</sup>=-.398, p=.044, df = 26).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We assessed research residents' expected skill decay and difficulty during an operative task and then evaluated the relationship of each item to residents' use of operative assistants.

Researchers have previously investigated the impact of hand dominance on performance and dexterity using focused, psychomotor tasks; however, few efforts have attempted to understand the importance of these skills at the procedural level. The study aim was to identify residents' coordination between their dominant and non-dominant hands while they grasp for sutures during a simulated laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Residents (PGY2-4) had 15 minutes to complete two steps of a simulated laparoscopic ventral hernia procedure. Residents self-reported their hand dominance in a pre-simulation survey. Those identified as ambidextrous or did not specify a handedness were excluded from analysis. Videos of each procedure were coded for manual coordination events and coordination duration during the active suture grasping phase. Manual coordination events were defined based on two categories: active motion of dominant, non-dominant, or both hands; and bimanual or unimanual manipulation of instruments during suture grasp attempts. A chi-square test was performed on the number of manual coordination events to discriminate between coordination choices.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Thirty-six residents (52.8% female, 91.7% right-handed) participated in the procedure and met inclusion criteria. Residents used various types of manual coordination during active suture grasping, ranging between 6-26 events (M=14.7, SD=4.5) (see Table 1). Residents switched hands 492 times (M=13.7, SD=4.5). Most of the time was spent using bimanual coordination (M=20.6 seconds, SD=27.2), while unimanual non-dominant coordination was used least (M=7.9 seconds, SD=6.9). As expected, residents did not rely on their dominant and non-dominant hands equally (&chi;<sup>2</sup> (2, N=37)=33.27, p&lt;.001). Only during 22.7% of manual coordination events did residents depend on their non-dominant hand (n=120), which was predominantly used to operate the suture passer device. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Time is frequently used as a metric for surgical experience. Having an understanding of those actions that increase operative time in novices may facilitate training. Our results support the use of focused training to improve hand coordination for bimanual tasks and to improve residents' use of their non-dominant hand. Future work is necessary to better understand how task completion time and overall performance are affected by residents' hand coordination during surgical tasks.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Understanding the cognitive and physical demands during simulation could aid in evaluating how simulation-based training prepares residents for unknown tasks. The objective of this study is to quantify and compare workload between standard and advanced surgical simulation tasks. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The study occurred during a semi-annual competitive event at our simulation center. Surgical residents had 3 minutes to complete a well-practiced Peg Transfer Task (PT), then 3 minutes to complete a never-seen before advanced Peg Transfer Task (aPT) mounted on the trainer ceiling. Dependent variables measured during these tasks included performance (time, successful transfers defined as moving a peg from one side to the [max of 12], and scores adjusted for task time and pegs transferred), self-reported workload, and ergonomic risk assessment for musculoskeletal injuries. Workload was measured using the validated NASA-TLX questionnaire with 6 sub-dimensions: mental demands, physical demands, temporal demands, performance, effort, and frustration. Comparison between PT and aPT and relationship among dependent variables were analyzed with paired t-tests, correlations, and regressions at &alpha;=0.05.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:All 28 surgical residents performed better on PT than aPT (Table), and those who performed better in PT performed better in aPT (&rho;=0.54, p=0.003). aPT was significantly more demanding for every workload sub-dimension (Table) except for temporal demand and performance. 21% (PT) and 43% (aPT) of trainees performed tasks in postures requiring immediately action for preventing injuries. Performance (scores and pegs transferred) was negatively correlated (&rho;=-0.28 to &ndash;0.48, p=0.001-0.036) with every workload sub-dimension except for temporal demand and effort (p&gt;0.05). Regression analysis adjusting for task (PT or aPT) found that perceived performance (&beta;= -0.11, p=0.001) was associated with pegs transferred and effort was associated with task time (&beta;= -2.1, p=0.028). Ergonomic risk scores were positively correlated with frustration and overall workload (&rho;=0.37 and 0.29, p=0.006 and 0.033 respectively). After regression analysis adjusting for task, only frustration was associated with higher ergonomic risk (&beta;= 2.5, p=0.015).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Both the questionnaire and ergonomic assessment tools quantified significant increases in workload and injury risks. Better preparation and training for advanced laparoscopic procedures will be mandatory to improve operative performance and prevent serious physical risk to trainees.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

In this spirit, we aimed to provide new trainees with simple, low-cost and effective resources to be utilized at home prior to matriculation, to better prepare them for early objective assessments in residency.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Matched medical students in 2015 were mailed a package of preparatory resources 1 month prior to matriculation into residency.  The package consisted of 'how-to' videos, low-fidelity models, and surgical instruments for 5 'stations' (arterial blood gas analysis, knot tying ability, suturing dexterity, anatomy knowledge, imaging knowledge) of our program's bi-annual intern objective assessment activity (Surgical Olympics). These 5 stations accounted for 50 points of the total 130 points possible (total 13 stations, 10 points each).  Surgical Olympics' scores for these stations from 2015 were compared with 2014 controls using the student's T-test. Residents who repeated the assessment in both years due to transition from preliminary to categorical positions, were excluded.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-six interns participated in the 2015 Surgical Olympics and were compared to 32 historical controls.  Residents were similar in age and operative/procedural experience, prior to matriculation and assessment.  Overall mean scores were low in these 5 stations, but significantly higher (19.7 vs. 15.4, p=0.04) in the 2015 class.  The largest increase was noted in the anatomy knowledge station (mean 5 vs. 1.9, p&lt;0.01).  Scores in stations assessing technical competence (knot tying ability, suturing dexterity) were similar between groups.  The number of perfect scores among the five stations was higher (10 vs. 5) in the 2015 group. Mean scores from the other 8 stations, for which no resources were mailed, showed no difference (29.3 vs 27.5, p=0.58).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Enacting a small, home-based curriculum for medical students prior to beginning surgical residency, improved performance on early objective assessments.  Low overall scores highlight the importance of and need for preparation prior to matriculation.

Due to the emphasis on training more primary care physicians for underserved areas, we hypothesized that students who indicate themselves as 'disadvantaged' on their AMCAS application are less likely to pursue surgical training.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a review of a UCSD medical school admissions database on students graduating during 2005-2014. Students were stratified into 'disadvantaged' and 'non-disadvantaged' groups. Data was recorded on age at entry, undergraduate science GPA, total MCAT scores, gender, surgery clerkship grade, USMLE step 1 score, and residency match into a surgical field at graduation. The primary endpoint, a comparison of the proportion of students matching into a surgical field between the two groups, was assessed with X<sup>2</sup> test. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess factors that predict the choice of general surgery versus another surgical field.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 1140 students enrolled and graduated, 219 (19.2%) students reported 'disadvantaged' on their application. One hundred fifty-eight (13.9%) of students chose a surgical field. Students from the disadvantage group were older at entry (24.4 years vs. 23.2 years (p&lt;0.001)), and had lower GPA (3.59 vs. 3.75 (p &lt;0.001) and total MCAT scores (30.1 vs. 33.7 (p&lt;0.001)). Twenty-seven (12.3%) of the 219 disadvantaged students chose a surgical career versus 130 (14.1%) of the 921 non-disadvantaged students (p=0.56). Amongst the surgical specialties chosen, general surgery was selected 57 (36.3%), orthopedic surgery 54 (34.4%), ENT 14 (8.9%), urology 14 (8.9%), neurosurgery 11 (7.0%), plastic surgery 6 (3.8%) and vascular surgery 1 (0.6%) time. On final multivariate logistic model, female gender (OR 3.9 (1.9-8.3), p &lt;0.01), disadvantaged status (OR 2.8 (1.1-7.1), p=0.03), and USMLE step 1 score &gt;227 (OR 0.43 (0.21-0.88), p=0.02) were significantly associated with choosing general surgery versus another surgical specialty.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The percentage of students that pursue surgical specialties from our institution is similar to percentages previously reported. While the disadvantaged cohort at our institution was older and had lower undergraduate GPA and MCAT scores, the proportion of disadvantaged students matching into a surgical specialty was not statistically different from the non-disadvantaged group. In order to address the future shortage of general surgeons in underserved areas, increasing enrollment of 'disadvantaged' students may alleviate the surgical desert.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Much of the current handoff literature is empiric, and a recent editorial in the Journal of GME recommended studying handoffs within an established framework.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a prospective, single institution study evaluating the process of patient handoffs in the context of a published communication framework. IRB approval and written consent of participants were obtained. Evaluation tools for the source, recevier and observer were developed to identify factors that impair the handoff process. A subset of handoffs included two observers and/or two receivers to assess rater consistency. Data analysis was generated with IBM<sup>&reg;</sup> SPSS<sup>&reg;</sup> 21.0 with Pearson/Spearman correlations and multivariate linear regressions. Rater consistency was assessed with intraclass correlations (ICC 2,1).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 126 handoffs were observed. Evaluations were completed by one observer (N=126), two observers (N=23), two receivers (N=39), one receiver (N=82), and one source (N=78). An average team handoff included 9.2(+4.6) patients, lasted 9.1(+5.4) minutes and had 4.7(+3.4) distractions recorded by the observer. Extraneous staff entering/exiting the room was the most common distraction, occuring 1.5(+1.9) times per handoff. The source and receivers recognized distractions in &gt;67% of handoffs, with the most common internal and external distractions being fatigue (60% of handoffs) and extraneous staff entering/exiting the room (31%), respectively. Teams with more patients spent less time per individual patient handoff (r= -0.298;p=0.001). Statistically significant intraclass correlations (p&le;.05) were moderate between observers (r&ge;0.4), but not receivers (r&lt;0.4). ICC values between different types of raters were inconsistent (p&gt;.05). The quality of the handoff process was predicted by presence of electronic devices (Beta=-0.565;p=0.005), number of teaching discussions (Beta=-0.417;p=0.048), resident hierarchy (Beta=-0.309;p=0.002), and the receiver's working relationship with the source  (Beta=0.829;p&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Studying the handoff process within an established framework highlights factors that impair communication. Internal and external distractions are common during handoffs, and along with the working relationship between the source and receiver, impact the quality of the handoff process. This information allows further study and targeted interventions of the handoff process to improve overall handoff effectiveness and patient safety.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Each handoff creates a potential source for communication errors that can lead to near-miss and patient harm events, particularly after complex operations.  The purpose of this project was to determine the utility and efficacy of a standardized electronic handoff system.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  At a single cancer center, a task-force of attending surgeons, trainees, and quality improvement personnel was established to improve the trainee-to-trainee patient care handoff process.  Root cause analysis and process mapping of the current state was performed to identify specific deficiencies and to document handoff compliance, accuracy, and efficiency.  The I-PASS (Illness severity, Patient summary, Action List, Situational awareness and contingency planning, and Synthesis by receiver) methodology was then used to create a standardized electronic program within the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) database frame work.  Each on-service trainee was provided a daily email link to the database for structured entry of patient identifiers, acuity, ongoing issues, on-call tasks, and attending preferences.  The system was programed to automatically aggregate these data into a single structured worklist for the on-call fellow. Patients identified as higher risk for complications required either a phone call (watcher designation) or a face-to-face sign out (unstable designation) in addition to the electronic patient handoff. Pre versus post-implementation handoff compliance (% of patients handed-off and % of night of surgery postoperative checks completed), accuracy (correct data transferred) and efficiency (on-call trainee time to complete worklist) were then compared.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Baseline compliance with handoffs was 72% of patients.  Errors in handoff data were found in 12% of unstructured handoffs and the mean on-call trainee time to compile the worklist was 1511 minutes.  During the pilot implementation of the structured electronic tool, 48 handoffs were performed on 49 patients admitted to high acuity surgical floors, increasing the compliance rate to 98%. Post-operative checks were documented in the chart on 27 of 29 eligible patients for 94% compliance.  The data error rate dropped slightly to 10%, with most errors related to non-medical data that did not impair the trainees ability to care for patients.  The mean on-call trainee time to compile the worklist reduced to only 53 minutes (p=0.023).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These data suggest that a standardized electronic tool can be used to improve compliance, accuracy and efficiency of handoff communication between surgical trainees. The electronic tool created allows for patient illness stratification and, when used with appropriate face-to-face or phone communication, has helped create a safer environment for patients undergoing complex surgical oncology procedures.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

We divided faculty members into Junior and Senior depending on the time (&le; 20 vs. &gt;20 years, respectively) since graduation from medical school.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 593 CT surgeons, 175 (30%) are practicing at the 10 departments (Top 10) with the highest NIH funding, while 418 (70%) at the remaining 40, with a median (range) number of CT surgeons per department of 15.5 (7-34) and 11 (1-24), respectively (p = 0.04), but no significant difference in seniority (junior: 41% of all at the Top 10 vs. 36% at the other; p NS). Senior CT surgeons of the Top 10 are more academically productive than their peers, while no such a difference is evident for junior faculty (see Graphic). CT surgeons of the Top 10 are more likely to have received at least part of their training at one of the Top 10 (66% of all, 72% of junior, and 62% of senior) than their peers (31%, 35%, and 29%, respectively; all p &lt; 0.001).

To obtain autologous MSCs, bone marrow aspiration was performed three weeks prior to surgery, from which MSCs were subsequently isolated and expanded in vitro. Intraoperatively, MSCs were transplanted into ischemic areas by direct intramyocardial injection (1.5x10<sup>8</sup> cells) adjacent to TMR channels. Cardiac function was assessed by transthoracic echocardiogram measuring left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and wall motion score index (WMSI) preoperatively as well as three, six, and twelve months postoperatively.

Clinical stage was determined by history &amp; physical, computerized tomography (CT), positron-emission tomography (PET), brain imaging studies (MRI), and endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS).  Pathologic stage was determined by intraoperative findings &amp; final pathology.  Patient survival was assessed through chart reviews, cancer registries, and national obituary searches.  Kaplan Meier curves were generated for clinical and pathologic stages.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Of 249 patients (mean age 67.8&plusmn;0.6yr; range 39-87) who underwent robotic assisted pulmonary lobectomy for NSCLC, mean tumor size was 3.2&plusmn;0.1cm (range 0.5-11.0cm), most commonly adenocarcinoma (62.7%), squamous cell carcinoma (21.7%), and neuroendocrine carcinoma (8.0%).

Beginning in 2017, Medicare will enforce provisions that subject hospitals to financial penalties for excess postoperative readmissions. Rehospitalizations following cardiac operations have been linked to rhythm disturbances and pulmonary complications, amongst others. Technologic advances in remote monitoring have led to the use of web-based digital health kits (DHK) aimed at reducing readmissions and improving postoperative outcomes. The present study was performed to determine DHK's efficacy in preventing 30-day readmissions and changes in patient satisfaction following the use of these devices.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a prospective study of all adult patients who underwent operations for valvular and coronary artery disease at our institution from 03/2014 to 06/2015. During the study period, 558 adult patients (Mean age: 64&plusmn; 14, 33% female) were identified, 27 of whom received a DHK following discharge (531 control group). In addition to providing a live video link with a provider specializing in cardiac surgery, the kit allowed for automatic daily transmission of weight, oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood pressure. Patients also completed a daily health survey targeting heart failure symptoms, wound healing, ambulation and adherence to medications. Abnormal vitals or survey responses triggered automatic notifications to the healthcare team. Satisfaction surveys were administered to participants and members of the healthcare team (Scale 1-5, 5=highly-satisfied). Pearson's chi-squared and student's t-tests were used to assess statistical differences in baseline characteristics and outcome variables (STATA 13).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:During the study period, use of DHK led to 1734 alerts and 138 interventions. The readmission rate for the DHK group was lower than the control group (7.4% vs. 10.9%, P=0.57). Reasons for readmission in the DHK group were amiodarone toxicity and syncope. Reasons for readmission in the control group included arrhythmias, heart failure, pericardial effusion, acute vascular complication, infection, and respiratory complications. Satisfaction surveys showed an overall satisfaction rating of 4.9 (&plusmn; 0.53) for DHK patients and 4.9 (&plusmn;0.20) for members of the care team.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In our study, utilization of DHKs was associated with a non-significant decrease in 30-day readmission rates. Both patients and members of the healthcare team were highly satisfied with this technology.  DHKs appear to extend care beyond the inpatient period and may provide much needed monitoring of surgical patients after discharge. However, their use leads to many provider alerts and interventions, making this modality resource-intensive. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of such kits in reducing readmissions and costs of care.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Cardiothoracic"

Nevertheless, PSP is managed similarly in both men and women. We investigated the natural history of PSP in females and determined the incidence of clinical, morphological, and histological features of catamenial pneumothorax (CP).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Between 5/2009 &ndash; 6/2015, all healthy normal-statured, menstruating women without tobacco or marijuana smoking, lung disease, trauma or pregnancy were included in this study. Clinico-demographic variables were studied using a prospective database. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to determine PSP recurrence and analyzed using log-rank test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The mean age of the study cohort (n=33) was 33.4+/- 14.4 years. Nine (27%) had left-sided and 24 (73%) had right-sided PSP. Tube thoracostomy in all led to successful initial treatment. Overall recurrence rate during follow up (median 14 mo) was 64%. Right PSP had higher and earlier recurrence (70%; median follow up 7 mo) compared to left (56%; 16 mo, p=0.02). Four patients (12%) presented with a large recurrent tension pneumothorax within the first 6 months of the initial episode. Two patients refused further treatment after ipsilateral recurrence. The remaining 19 patients (58%) underwent surgery including apical wedge resection with mechanical pleurodesis (12/19, 63%) or subtotal pleurectomy (7/19, 37%). One patient had ipsilateral recurrence after surgery which was treated with talc poudrage. Histology showed apical blebs/fibrosis in 11 patients with mesothelial hyperplasia and reactive changes but no endometrial glands or stroma.Eight (24%) patients had symptoms within 72 hours of onset of menses. Of these, 3 patients had known pelvic endometriosis. All 8 patients were placed on oral contraception, however all had ipsilateral recurrence within the first year of the initial episode. Six (75%) were right and 2 (25%) were left pneumothorax. All 8 patients underwent surgery at the second episode. Thoracoscopy revealed diaphragmatic fenestrations in 4 (50%) and nodular deposits in 3 patients (38%). No endometrial glands/stroma were seen in any specimens. Three (38%) patients had hemosiderin-laden macrophages at the site of fenestrations.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:PSP in healthy, normal-statured menstruating women has high recurrence and can be life threatening.  This may warrant surgical intervention at the initial episode. Further, the diagnosis of CP should be made clinically as pathologic findings of endometrial glands or stroma are rare. Women with clinical CP also have high recurrence despite hormonal suppression and thus should be considered for pleural symphysis at initial presentation.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Cardiothoracic"

Several hospital categories ('Adult Cardiology and Heart Surgery', 'Adult Pulmonology', 'Adult Cancer', and 'Honor Roll'), as well as the medical school ranking for research (but not for primary care), from the US News &amp; World Report were significantly associated with differences in academic productivity (see Graphic). Ranking based on NIH funding was not a significant correlate, either considering funding provided to the departments of surgery (top 10 institutions vs. other: median H index 14.5 vs. 14; p = 0.94), to medical schools (17 vs. 14; p = 0.26), or to the affiliated departments of internal medicine (15 vs. 14; p = 0.55), respectively. Designation as an independent department (median H index: 15) was not associated with a different academic productivity than designation as a division of a broader department of surgery (median H index: 14; p = 0.58). When the division chairperson had an individual H index of at least 50, the whole CT surgical group was overall more productive (median H index: 18) than those groups with a chairperson whose H index was less than 50 (median H index: 14; p = 0.005).  Seniority was never found to be significantly different in any of the above mentioned comparisons. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The US News &amp; World Report rankings provide a good representation of the academic productivity of cardiothoracic surgical groups, while NIH funding rankings do not.

However, the role of preoperative aspirin administration in cardiac surgery still remains uncertain. While several studies have reported lower mortality rates associated with preoperative aspirin use in CABG patients, there is a paucity of data regarding patients undergoing CABG combined with valvular procedures. The present study aimed to determine the utility of preoperative aspirin administration on clinical outcomes in the setting of combined CABG with valve surgery. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A total of 565 patients who underwent combined CABG and valve surgery at our institution from 2008 to 2015 were identified for analysis. After exclusion of emergency cases, 536 patients were placed into two groups: those who received aspirin within 5 days prior to surgery (ASA group; n=328), and those who did not (N-ASA group; n=208). Baseline characteristics associated with aspirin use&mdash;including age, gender, race, body mass index, recent myocardial infarction, smoking, and use of anticoagulants&mdash;were compared between groups. Propensity score matching based on twenty-five preoperative factors was then used to account for intergroup differences. Logistic regression models were developed to compare the rate of postoperative complications, including renal failure, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and 30-day mortality, between groups. All statistical analysis was performed using Stata 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station TX). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: After propensity score matching, the sample size was reduced to 517 patients (ASA; n=322, N-ASA; n=195). The ASA group had significantly higher rates of patients above age 75; patients taking anticoagulants, statins or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; and patients with a prior history of peripheral vascular disease (P&lt;0.05). ASA patients were not more likely to have mitral or aortic valve surgery. On logistic regression analysis, no significant differences were found in the rate of postoperative complications, including 30-day mortality. However, a trend towards a decreased incidence of MACE and an increased incidence of renal failure and intra/postoperative blood transfusion was evident [Table 1]. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In a propensity-matched cohort, preoperative aspirin use was not associated with an increased incidence of adverse events in patients undergoing combined CABG and valve procedures. These patients often comprise a distinct group since coronary disease is frequently found incidentally in valve surgical candidates. The utility of aspirin administration in the preoperative period in such patients deserves further evaluation.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Cardiothoracic"

TOS types were examined using post-operative ICD-9 diagnosis codes. Chi-square and ANOVA tests were used to estimate the proportions and mean (&plusmn;SD) values as appropriate.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1,180 patients underwent FRRS during the study period, 1,007 (85.3%) were of the neurogenic type (NTOS), 32 (2.7%) patients had arterial TOS (ATOS) and 141 (12.0%) patients had venous TOS (VTOS). The majority of patients were female (58.3%). Patients with ATOS were significantly older (ATOS: 48.9, &plusmn;13.8, VTOS: 35.2, &plusmn;11.9 and NTOS: 34.3, &plusmn;12.3 years). Overall, 19.3% of the cohort examined were current smokers and this proportion was not different across TOS types (p=0.065). However, among smokers, mean pack-years was higher for patients with ATOS (16.2, &plusmn;27.9) compared to NTOS (4.7, &plusmn;11.5) and VTOS (3.4, &plusmn;11.6) (p&lt;0.001). Mean operation time was over one hour longer for patients with ATOS than for patients with NTOS or VTOS (p&lt;0.001). Average hospital length of stay was longer for patients with ATOS (5.5 days, &plusmn; 6.7) (p&lt;0.001). The majority of surgical site infections were superficial (1% of NTOS, 1.4% VTOS and none of the ATOS cases).

Only one patient developed post-operative stroke after FRRS for ATOS. Return to OR within 30 days from the operation occurred in a total of 73 cases (5.6% in NTOS, 18.8% in ATOS and 7.8% in VTOS patients, p=0.007). For the years 2011-2013; all the re-operations were unplanned, with ATOS as the most likely to be re-operated on (p=0.013), readmissions occurred in 33 patients and didn't differ across TOS types (p=0.525).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Thoracic Outlet Syndrome has been previously studied mainly in highly-experienced single-center contexts. We sought to use NSQIP to further explore its occurrence, types and post-op outcomes at a national level. To our knowledge, this is the first and largest study that represents outcomes of FRRS for TOS from different centers across the United States.

Post-CABG AF can result in longer hospital stay, and has been shown to decrease survival at 10 years.  This study assesses survival and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 20 years in patients with new-onset post-operative AF after CABG. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients undergoing CABG between 1994 and 2014 at the Valley Hospital were assessed and matched by surgical approach. In the resulting population of 1856 patients, 363 developed new-onset post-operative AF.  Logistic regression was used to determine the significant factors associated with the development of post-op AF.  Patients were followed for a mean of 12 &plusmn; 5 years (ranging 1 to 21.4 years).  A univariate Kaplan Meier analysis was used to compare long-term survival and MACE in patients with and without new-onset Post-op AF. A multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards Regression analysis was used to determine which factors were independently associated with decreased survival.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Overall 363 patients (19.6%) developed AF post CABG. Logistical regression demonstrated that male gender, increased age, prior cerebrovascular accidents and on-pump CABG were associated with the development of post-op AF.  Follow-up MACE in the 1856 patients included 30-day mortality (17 pts, 0.9%), late death (513 pts, 27.6%) late myocardial infarction (76 pts, 4.1%), late PCI (210 pts, 11.3%) repeat CABG (14 pts, 0.8%), any repeat revascularization (219 pts, 11.8%), any stroke (78 pts, 4.2%) and cerebrovascular accident (34 pts, 1.8%). Kaplan Meier analysis showed that patients with post op AF had poorer long-term survival (Log Rank Test p&lt;0.0001) and increased occurrence of MACE (Log Rank Test p&lt;0.0001).  Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards Regression showed that LVEF&lt;35%, Increased age, diabetes, CHF, Active smoking, and History of Renal failure were independently associated with increased MACE and decreased survival.   Presence of On-pump CABG, presence of cardiogenic shock, and use of LIMA-SVG over BIMA were independently solely associated with increased mortality.  Presence of atrial fibrillation post CABG was independently associated with reduced survival (Adj HR: 1.440; 95%CI: 1.179-1.757; p&lt;0.0001) and increased occurrence of MACE (Adj HR: 1.297; 95CI: 1.094-1.537; p=0.003).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our study demonstrates that new-onset AF after CABG is associated with poorer survival and increased MACE at 20 years follow-up.  Unfortunately, we have no tools to know how many of the patients that developed AF actually had subclinical symptoms prior to CABG.  It is unclear whether CABG causes AF or uncovers an underlying subset of patients conducive to poor outcomes, where AF is just an additional factor.  This data suggests that AF is a marker of pathology that deserves close surveillance, not only in the post-operative period, but also in the long term follow up.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Cardiothoracic"

Association between number of morbidity events and FTR was analyzed with logistic regression. The most common complication cascade was analyzed for each procedure to identify the most common initial complication and to compare FTR rates.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:34,556 patients underwent esophagectomy (morbidity/mortality/FTR-32.8%/2.1%/5.5%), lung resection (14.1%/1.7%/9.7%), gastrectomy (16.9%/1.7%/9.2%), pancreaticoduodenectomy (25.8%/2.3%/7.8%), hepatectomy (15.5%/1.6%/9.8%), and colectomy (15%/1.3%/6.5%).  Patients who died suffered more sequential complications (Figure) and multiplicative odds of death with additional events. Bleeding requiring transfusion was the most common initial event in every index procedure (13.6%-overall, range 8.1%-lung, 21.5%-pancreaticoduodenectomy/hepatectomy). Among deaths, the most common cascade was bleeding (42%), respiratory failure (18%), septic shock (28%). Among non-transfused patients, the most common cascade was superficial infection, organ space infection, sepsis. Non-transfused patients were less likely to have multiple complications and had better mortality and FTR rates (mortality 0.99% vs. 4.84%; FTR 5.37% vs. 11.99%, p&lt;0.001). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Avoidance of perioperative transfusions mitigates the magnitude of complication cascades and improves FTR rates. Although bleeding requiring transfusion is commonly overlooked when measuring perioperative complications, it is the most common sentinel domino to fall. To augment surgical mortality reduction programs, hospitals should pursue aggressive programmatic transfusion avoidance strategies in the perioperative setting.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Our hospital has performed poorly in regard to CAUTI rates in surgical patients, ranking in the bottom 10-20% of ACS NSQIP hospitals. Since CAUTI rate is a publicly reported measure linked to healthcare quality and financial reimbursement, we aimed to decrease CAUTI rates by focusing on both reducing catheter utilization in the operating room (OR) and removing them in the immediate post-operative period.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A multi-disciplinary team of stakeholders involved in the peri-operative care of surgical patients used DMAIC methodology for this project. Institutional data were analyzed before and after our interventions. Goals were set to: 1) decrease the number of catheters inserted in the OR for cases less than three hours, 2) increase the number of catheters removed prior to transfer to the floor, 3) stimulate culture change regarding surgeons' utilization of urinary catheters, and 4) decrease CAUTI rates attributable to catheters inserted in the OR. We implemented a formal pre- and post-operative discussion of catheter indication and necessity with the surgical team (pre-operative) and attending surgeon (post-operative) into the OR nursing procedural protocol. Documentation of compliance with each intervention was mandated to facilitate the audit and feedback of performance. Six months of post-intervention data regarding performance on each of our goals was collected and analyzed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A mean of 437 catheters per month were inserted for cases lasting less than three hours prior to the intervention, compared to a mean of 391 catheters per month post-intervention (p=0.044). Utilization of catheters for cases shorter than three hours decreased from 23.7% pre-intervention to 20.9% post-intervention (p=0.001), representing an 11.8% relative reduction in overall catheter insertion. In addition to reducing overall utilization, the percent of catheters removed prior to the patient transferring to the floor increased from 18.3% to 21.0% (p=0.252). Lastly, the rate of surgical CAUTI decreased from 2.5 occurrences per month prior to intervention to 0.3 occurrences per month post-intervention (p=0.006), including zero occurrences in four out of the six months following intervention. This represents an 89.1% decrease in the rate of surgical CAUTI.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: By using rigorous, data-driven process improvement methodology, our multi-disciplinary team was able to identify and successfully implement novel interventions aimed at decreasing the rate of CAUTI among surgical patients at our institution. We successfully met our goals, most notably dramatically decreasing the rate of CAUTI in surgical patients. These interventions have led to institutional changes in practice regarding peri-operative catheter insertion that will continue to decrease CAUTI rates and improve the quality of surgical care.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Given the widespread use of ACS NSQIP in research and recent calls for it to become a platform for national public reporting and pay-for-performance initiatives, it is important to understand which types of hospitals elect to participate in the program. Our objective was to compare the characteristics of ACS NSQIP-participating hospitals to non-participating hospitals in the United States.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using the 2013 American Hospital Association data on hospital characteristics, hospitals participating in ACS NSQIP were compared to non-participating hospitals. The 2013 Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) dataset was used to calculate hospital operating margin as a measure of financial health. The CMS 2013 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Final Rule Impact File was used to abstract the Medicare and Medicaid Services Value Based Purchasing (VBP) and Disproportionate Share adjustment scores, which were used as proxies for hospital quality and patient population, respectively.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 3,872 total U.S. general medical and surgical hospitals, 475 (12.3%) participated in ACS NSQIP. ACS NSQIP hospitals performed 29.0% of operations in the U.S, with a slightly greater share of inpatient operations (32.4%) and a smaller share of outpatient operations (27.1%). Compared to non-participating hospitals, ACS NSQIP hospitals had a higher mean annual inpatient surgical case volume (6,426 vs 1,874; p&lt;0.001), a larger number of hospital beds (420 vs 167; p&lt;0.001), were more often academic affiliates (35.2% vs 4.1%; p&lt;0.001), were more often accredited by JCAHO and CoC (p&lt;0.001), and had higher mean operating margins (p&lt;0.05). ACS NSQIP hospitals were less likely to be designated as critical access hospitals (p&lt;0.001). No significant differences in VBP or Disproportionate Share adjustment scores were found. States with the highest percentage of hospitals participating in ACS NSQIP were states with established surgical quality improvement collaboratives (Figure 1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Hospitals that participate in ACS NSQIP represent 12% of all U.S. hospitals performing inpatient surgery, yet they perform nearly 30% of all surgeries done in the U.S.  ACS NSQIP disproportionately includes larger, accredited, and academic-affiliated hospitals with more financial resources. These findings should be taken into account in research studies using ACS NSQIP, and more importantly, indicate that additional efforts are needed to address barriers to enrollment in order to facilitate participation in surgical quality improvement programs by all hospitals.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

VTE rates are also a publicly tracked patient safety measure affecting institutional quality metrics and reimbursement. Electronic medical record (EMR) alerts have been widely adopted to improve VTE prophylaxis administration. This study examines the association of VTE prophylaxis and EMR alerts with VTE rates.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  At our urban academic medical center, 10318 adult surgical admissions between November 2013 and March 2015 were queried for VTE defined by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicator 12 and Joint Commission Core Measure VTE-6. Daily pharmacologic prophylaxis patterns were prospectively collected for patients and categorized as continuous (initiated within 24h without interruptions), delayed (initiated &gt;24h without interruptions), interrupted (interrupted for &gt;24h with or without delay), none, or other (nonstandard drugs or dosing). Patients were also categorized by whether an EMR alert fired during their admission. Associations between VTE incidence, prophylaxis, length of stay (LOS), and demographics were explored.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 131 VTEs (12.7 VTE per 1000 patients) among the surgical admissions. Patients who developed a VTE were older (56.4 vs. 52.2 years, p&lt;0.01) and had longer LOS (16.3 vs. 6.5 days, p&lt;0.01). 45.7% of patients had an EMR alert to prescribe VTE prophylaxis. The VTE rate for patients who received an alert was significantly higher than patients without an alert (17.5 vs 9.0 per 1000 patients; p&lt;0.01). 33.6% of patients received continuous prophylaxis, 18.3% experienced delays, 13.2% experienced interruptions, 25.7% received no prophylaxis and 9.3% had nonstandard prophylaxis regimens. Patients with interruptions had a significantly higher incidence of VTE than patients with continuous prophylaxis (8.8 vs 30.7 per 1000 patients, p&lt;0.01) and all other prophylaxis groups. Increased LOS was associated with increased likelihood of interruptions and VTE. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, prophylaxis group and age were associated with VTE incidence independent of gender, race, and LOS. The highest incidences of VTE were among patients admitted to cardiac surgery, followed by trauma and otolaryngology. Interruptions were most common among patients admitted to trauma surgery, otolaryngology, and bariatric surgery.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Despite continuous prophylaxis 8.8 per 1000 patients still developed a VTE, and interruptions conferred more risk of VTE than delays. This suggests patient safety measures should be reevaluated to emphasize minimizing interruptions in addition to delays and overall VTE rates. Increased efforts to investigate causes and develop multidisciplinary strategies to minimize interruptions should be undertaken. Optimization of EMR alerts may be a useful adjunct to identify patients at high risk for VTE.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

However, the benefits of pain management must be weighed against the potentially lethal risk of postoperative opioid overdose (POOD).  This analysis aims to 1) describe national trends and outcomes of in-hospital POOD in patients undergoing surgery and 2) identify predictors of POOD.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective multi-institutional cohort study of patients undergoing a major elective operation from 2002 to 2011 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample.  Patients with POOD were identified using ICD-9 codes for poisoning from or adverse effects of opioids.  Patients with adverse effects from opioids required a concurrent code for respiratory failure, apnea, or hypoxia to be included in the POOD cohort.  Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of POOD.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Among 13,982,557 patients, 11,669 (0.083%) had POOD with the rate increasing over the study period from 0.6 to 1.2 per 1,000 cases.  Patients with POOD died more frequently during hospitalization (1.7% vs. 0.47%, p-value=&lt;0.001).  Substance abuse history was the strongest predictor of POOD (OR=14.9; 95% CI: 12.5-17.6) on multivariate analysis.  Gender, age, race, income, geographic location, operation type, and comorbid diseases were significant predictors of POOD.  Hospital variables including teaching status, size, and urban/rural location did not predict POOD.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:POOD is a rare, but potentially lethal complication, with increasing prevalence. Perioperative care providers should consider predictors of POOD to identify patients at greatest risk, while providing adequate pain control.  Postoperative monitoring and treatment protocols should be thoughtfully employed to target high risk patients and avoid this potentially fatal complication.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Each specialty differs in surgical training, including residency structure and breadth of operative experience. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of surgeon specialty and volume on outcomes following total thyroidectomy for cancer.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective cohort study was performed on patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer between 2007 and 2011 as identified from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS). Physician identifiers were used to classify surgical specialty based on procedural complement. Propensity score matching for comorbidities was performed to allow for comparisons between GS and ENT for outcomes including complications, mortality, length of stay (LOS), and cost of care. Comparisons between provider volume and complication rates were also assessed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 11,391 inpatient total thyroidectomies were identified in the NIS, of which 54% were performed by ENT and 46% by GS. Postoperative complications occurred in 3.4% of both groups. GS were less likely than ENT to have neurologic (p&lt;0.01), respiratory (p&lt;0.01), and hemorrhagic complications (p&lt;0.001), and were more likely to have speech disturbances (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in inpatient mortality between providers; however, the cost of care and LOS were significantly lower for GS. After propensity score matching for comorbidities, cost ($8,304 vs. $11,530; p&lt;0.001) and LOS (1.7 days vs. 2.3 days; p&lt;0.001) remained significantly lower for GS in comparison to ENT.  Surgeons, regardless of specialty, who performed less than 5 total thyroidectomies per year had a higher complication rate compared to those with higher volume.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While generalizability is limited based on exclusion of outpatient procedures, our analysis shows that physician specialty and case volume are significantly associated with cost, length of stay, and complication rate following total thyroidectomy. A more detailed evaluation of the differences in technique and postoperative management between the two specialties may inform changes in practice that may benefit patients who undergo total thyroidectomy by either specialty.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

However, due to the very nature of AMT, fatal and non-fatal occurrences are bound to happen. This study reviews aeromedical incidents since 2003, aiming to provide additional insight into a wide range of factors potentially associated with fatal and non-fatal AMT incidents (AMTI). We hypothesized that weather/visual conditions, post-crash fire, and time of day are all correlated with the risk of AMTI with 'injury or fatality'.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Various specialty databases were queried for AMTI between January 1, 2003 and June 30, 2015. Additional Internet-based resources were also utilized to find any additional AMTI (including non-US occurrences) in order to augment the event sample size available for analysis. Univariate analyses of the collected sample were then performed for association between 'fatal crash or injury' (FCOI) and weather/visual conditions, aircraft type/make, pilot error, equipment failure, post-incident fire, time of day (6am-7pm vs 7pm-6am), weekend (Fri-Sun) versus weekday (Mon-Thurs), season of the year, presence of patient on board. Variables reaching significance level of P&lt;0.20 were included in multivariate analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 58 AMTI were identified. Helicopters were involved in 51/58 AMTI, with 7/58 fixed-wing incidents. Comparing pre-2003 data with post-2003 data (Figure 1), we noted an overall decrease in AMTI per month (0.70 versus 0.38, respectively). However, the number of fatalities per year increased slightly (7.20 vs 8.08, respectively). There was no association between aircraft make/model and FCOI. In univariate analyses, weather/visual conditions, time of incident (7pm-6am), and post-incident fire all reached statistical significance sufficient for inclusion in multivariate analysis. Factors independently associated with FCOI included post-incident fire (O.R. 12.6, 95% CI 1.16-137.2) and time of incident between 7pm and 6am (O.R. 8.28, 95% CI 1.25-55.0). Weather conditions and impaired visibility were not independently associated with FCOI.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The current study supports previous observation that post-crash fire is independently associated with FCOI. However, our data do not corroborate published reports suggesting that weather conditions and impaired visibility are predictive of fatal AMTI. In addition, this study demonstrates that flights between the hours of 7pm-6am may be associated with greater odds of FCOI. Efforts directed at identification, remediation and active prevention of factors associated with AMTI and FCOI are warranted given the global increase in aeromedical transport.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Our aim was to determine 1) if existing models stratify patients into groups by risk and 2) which model best predicts the rate of SSO and SSI.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who underwent VHR and were followed for at least one month were included. Using two datasets--a retrospective multicenter database (Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative; VHOC) and a single-center prospective database (Prospective)--each patient was assigned a predicted risk with each of the following models: Ventral Hernia Risk Score (VHRS), Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG), Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Wound Class, and Hernia Wound Risk Assessment Tool (HW-RAT). Patients in the Prospective database were also assigned a predicted risk from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were compared to assess the predictive accuracy of the models for SSO and SSI. Pearson's Chi-Square was used to determine which models were able to risk-stratify patients into groups with significantly differing rates of actual SSO and SSI.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The VHOC database (n=795) had an overall SSO and SSI rate of 23% and 17%. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.56, 0.54, 0.52, 0.60) and SSI (0.55, 0.53, 0.50, 0.58). The VHRS (p=0.01) and HW-RAT (p&lt;0.01) significantly stratified patients into tiers for SSO while the VHWG (p&lt;0.05) and HW-RAT (p&lt;0.05) stratified for SSI (Table 1). In the Prospective database (n=88), 14% and 8% developed a SSO and SSI. The AUC were low for SSO (0.63, 0.54, 0.50, 0.57, 0.69) and modest for SSI (0.81, 0.64, 0.55, 0.62, 0.73). The ACS-NSQIP (p&lt;0.01) stratified for SSO while the VHRS (p&lt;0.01) and ACS-NSQIP (p&lt;0.05) stratified for SSI. In both databases VHRS, VHWG, and CDC overestimated risk of SSO and SSI while HW-RAT and ACS-NSQIP underestimated risk for all groups.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: All five existing predictive models have limited ability to risk-stratify patients and accurately assess risk of SSO. However, both the VHRS and ACS-NSQIP demonstrate modest success in identifying patients at risk for SSI. Continued model refinement is needed to improve upon the two highest performing models (VHRS and ACS-NSQIP) along with investigation to determine if modifications to perioperative management based on risk stratification can improve outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

However, SSCs may have additional benefits. Good catches and near misses are defined as events which can lead to patient harm but are prevented from occurring.  We hypothesized that SSCs increase good catches and near misses. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A direct observational study from May-July 2015 was conducted. During the performance of the 19-point, pre-incision phase of the SSC, five trained observers documented checklist adherence and good catch or near miss events. The events were organized into five categories by a patient safety expert: communication failures, medication issues, equipment issues, process issues, and safety issues. Regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between events and the performance of the checklist (adherence to all checkpoints), surgical specialty and case duration. Inter-rater reliability (kappa) was determined for checklist adherence.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Among 212 cases from 9 pediatric surgical subspecialties, SSCs resulted in detection of at least one event in 37 (17%) cases. The most common events were related to process issues (32.4%); the least common events were due to equipment issues (2.7%, Figure). Median (range) pre-incision checkpoints completion was 18 (7-19). Pediatric cardiovascular surgery cases had the highest event rate of 33%: one good catch or near miss for every 3 cases. Kappa for the pre-incision checklist was 0.70 (95%CI 0.63-0.88). On regression analysis, there were no significant associations between the number of events per checklist and checklist adherence, surgical specialty, or case duration. The median number of events did not vary with case length (&lt;30 min = 1, 31-60 min = 1, 61-120 min = 1, &gt;121 min = 1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Surgical safety checklists, when performed with high fidelity, can detect good catches and near misses. Evaluation of SSCs often focuses only on morbidity and mortality, while good catches and near misses are not reported. Identification and categorization of these events should be routinely measured since they provide targets for focused quality improvement which may lead to reduced errors and adverse events.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Prior studies have been limited by retrospective, cross-sectional designs and lack of controls, and most have not assessed patient decision making. We evaluated outcomes of reconstruction in a prospective, longitudinal, controlled study and examined whether informed choice was associated with outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Adult women undergoing mastectomy for stage 0-III breast cancer or prophylaxis were enrolled at a single site and surveyed before surgery and at 12 months. Decision making was assessed with the Decision Quality Instrument, rating and ranking scales, and conjoint analysis. Making an 'informed choice' was defined as having at least 50% knowledge and treatment concordant with preferences. Satisfaction w/ breasts, psychosocial well-being (WB), sexual WB, and physical WB of the chest were measured with the BreastQ (range 0-100). Decisional outcomes were measured with the Satisfaction with Decisions and Decision Regret scales. Baseline scores were compared using t-tests. Preference concordance was assessed with a kappa score. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine differences (by treatment and by informed choice) in patient-reported outcomes at 12 months, adjusting for baseline values, demographics, and clinical characteristics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 126 patients enrolled (83% participation); 111 completed baseline and 12 mo surveys. The immediate reconstruction rate was 44% (15 delayed reconstruction cases were excluded to simplify analysis). Patients having reconstruction were more likely to be white (88 vs. 69%, p=0.05), partnered (81 vs. 49%, p=0.002), or college educated (95 vs. 76%, p=0.01), and less likely to have adjuvant therapy (17 vs. 65%, p&lt;0.01). Mean age was 54 and did not differ by treatment. Mean knowledge was 57%. 63% of patients had treatment that was concordant with preferences. 43% of patients made an informed choice. Satisfaction with breasts, sexual WB, psychosocial WB, and physical WB-chest declined from baseline to 12 mos, regardless of reconstruction. On multivariable analysis and adjusting for baseline values, reconstruction was associated with higher satisfaction w/ breasts (beta 13.1, p=0.008) at 12 mos; it was not associated with change in sexual WB (p=0.07), psychosocial WB (p=0.16) or physical WB (p=0.61).

Studies have suggested that obesity may worsen post-operative outcomes such as surgical site infection (SSI), but many of these studies categorized patients only as obese or non-obese. By further stratifying the obese population, we aim to investigate the role of obesity classes in determining post-operative outcomes for patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery were queried from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) 2011-2013 cohort and stratified by body mass index category into underweight (&lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and class I (30-34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), II (35-39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and III (&gt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) obesity.  Univariate and bivariate comparisons were made with Chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank Sums tests to determine differences among categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Logistic regression analyses identified risk factors for 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission, and SSI (defined as superficial/deep SSI or wound disruption but excluding organ space infection). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 74,891 patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery, 3,265 (4.4%) were underweight, 21,685 (29%) normal weight, 24,705 (33%) overweight, 14,797 (19.8%) class I obesity, 6,324 (8.4%) class II obesity, and 4,115 (5.5%) class III obesity. Comorbidities included non-insulin-dependent diabetes (10%), smoking (17.5%), and hypertension (49.2%). SSI rates in the overall cohort were 8.7% and ranged from the highest in class III obesity to the lowest in normal weight patients (15% vs. 6.5%, p&lt;0.001). Fully adjusted modelling showed an increased risk of post-operative SSI with increased obesity class: Overweight (OR 1.34, CI 1.24-1.44), Class I (OR 1.68, CI 1.55-1.82), Class II (OR 2.32 CI 2.10-2.55), and Class III (OR 2.56 CI 2.20-2.74). Underweight patients were at increased risk of 30-day mortality (OR 1.34 CI 1.01-1.79), but obesity did not predict mortality. No weight categories were associated with an increased risk of readmission. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Obesity has a dose dependent association with SSI following elective colorectal surgery, but is not associated with readmission or 30-day mortality. BMI may account for some of the variation in post-operative outcomes such as SSI. In order to improve post-operative outcomes, pre-habilitation including supervised weight loss may play an important role prior to elective surgery.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient-Centered Outcomes","Cross Disciplinary"

Many studies have evaluated predictors of complication development. The goal of this study was to assess the temporal relationships among post-operative complications.  Knowledge of these relationships will improve our ability to select targeted interventions to prevent cascades of these complications. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database includes preoperative risk factors, intraoperative variables and 30-day postoperative outcomes for patients who underwent major inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures.  This study includes cases from this database from 2005 &ndash; 2013.  Data included all ACS NSQIP-defined complications within 30 days post operation.  Machine learning methods were used to model the temporal dependencies between complications.  A Markov chain model was developed to model the development of subsequent complications given knowledge of the complications a patient has experienced. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The model was best at predicting death, coma longer than a day, cardiac arrest, septic shock, renal failure, pneumonia, unplanned re-intubation, longer than 2 days on a ventilator and bleeding transfusion (greater than 75% sensitivity at the 75% specificity threshold).  The risk for later complications depends on the complications a patient has experienced.  We found some complications to be more likely to occur in insolation while others are likely to be associated with a second.  Figure 1 shows the risk for complications given a prior complication (normalized by the overall likelihood of diagnosing that complication), with red indicating greater risk and blue less risk than baseline.  Complications such as cardiac arrest or MI, renal insufficiency or failure, stroke, intubation, septic shock and coma contributed to complication cascades to a much greater extent than other complications.  For example, a patient who has a coma has on odds ratio of &gt;2 of dying within 30 days of the operation while the odds ratio for death following a diagnosis of pneumonia is &lt;0.5. <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:A Markov Chain Model combining information about prior complications and time to occurrence after surgery can inform the likelihood of future complications.

Despite significant infrastructure and funding, these investigations are hindered by a multitude of unanticipated hurdles.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a funded, prospective/retrospective, IRB-approved, tissue and data study incorporating SNP analysis of breast cancer patients treated at an NCI designated, comprehensive cancer center. All cases and controls had archival tissue and were at least 5 years from their incident breast cancer diagnosis. Large-scale prospective institutional and programmatic databanks, tissue banks, and medical record chart review were leveraged. Tissue specimens were reviewed by a research pathologist for verification and adequacy. Sequencing of 10 selected genes at 30x coverage was targeted. Causes of attrition in the 1:1 matched case-control population were evaluated. Matched pairs were not matched by tissue type.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 2927 stage I-III breast cancer patients were reviewed to identify 130 matched case-control pairs (260 total subjects) with specimens and data. Because of paired matching, elimination of one specimen resulted in the elimination of a pair if a replacement could not be identified. Of 260 specimens (130 pairs), 192 tissue samples (96 matched pairs) were identified (73.8%) over an 18-month time frame.  156 were archived FFPE (slides or blocks) and 36 were frozen (solid tissue, blood, extracted DNA). Thirty-four of the 130 data-matched pairs were unusable (26.1%): in 28 pairs, tissue could not be identified for one of the paired subjects. This was due to: missing blocks/slides, compromised tissue cases, or specimens that did not represent normal tissue due to inflammation or necrosis. In 2 other pairs, adequate tissue for macrodissection could not be identified. Four additional pairs were excluded due to insufficient DNA yields at extraction for one of the paired specimens. Of 192 specimens, 150 (75 pairs) passed the quantifiable DNA quality control studies (Qubit). Of 75 pairs sent for DNA sequencing, 47 pairs (36.2%) had evaluable data. The remaining 28 had insufficient hybridization for 30x coverage. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite significant infrastructure and resources, retrospective tissue studies are fraught with evaluable specimen loss at each step of the process.  When assessing feasibility of retrospective tissue studies, investigators should consider a significant dropout rate within populations of archival tissue specimens.","Outcomes/Clinical","Health Informatics","Cross Disciplinary"

Current guidelines for quality palliative care recommend that all patients with a potentially life-limiting illness receive a palliative care assessment when feeding tube placement is considered. We aimed to characterize the extent of unmet palliative care need in patients receiving gastrostomy tubes by examining palliative care processes and outcomes in this population.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a retrospective study of all adult non-trauma inpatients who underwent gastrostomy tube placement in the year 2013. Patients were identified based on procedure codes. We abstracted data regarding demographics, diagnosis, indications, palliative care processes, and outcomes via chart review. The primary outcome was receipt of palliative care assessment prior to tube placement. Secondary outcomes included functional status at discharge as measured by Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) or Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), as well as in-hospital and 6-month mortality. We used counts and proportions to describe study variables and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with receipt of palliative care.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: One hundred twenty-eight patients met inclusion criteria. All but 3 had a serious or life-limiting illness. Of the remaining 125 patients, head and neck malignancy (37%) was the leading indication, followed by acute cerebrovascular accident (27%), prolonged respiratory failure (15%), and other neurologic disorders (14%). Only 14% of patients in whom a tube was placed had a palliative care assessment prior to the procedure. Only indication and race/ethnicity were statistically significantly associated with this care pattern.  No head and neck malignancy patients received a palliative care assessment, and non-black patients were much less likely to receive palliative care assessment prior to gastrostomy placement (OR: 0.28 (0.11-0.69)). 14% of patients required tube change due to a complication within 1 year of placement. In-hospital and 6-month mortality were 6% and 16%, respectively. 62% of survivors to discharge suffered from significant functional disability defined as a GOS of &le;3 or a MRS of &ge;4: unable to walk or attend to bodily needs without assistance.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite expert consensus guidelines, the majority of patients with serious or life-limiting illness did not receive palliative care assessment prior to placement of a gastrostomy tube. While considered routine procedures, patients requiring feeding access have high mortality rates and poor functional outcomes. This suggests that consultation for feeding tube placement is an appropriate trigger for palliative care assessment and intervention to ensure treatment is aligned with patient preferences.  Surgeons can promote high-quality, patient-centered care by taking an active role in this process.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient-Centered Outcomes","Cross Disciplinary"

ERAS programs are a multimodal approach, with interventions during all stages of care: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. ERAS programs have been proposed to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care costs. This meta-analysis examines the impact of ERAS programs on patient outcomes and recovery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A comprehensive literature search of all published randomized control trials (RCTs) assessing the use of ERAS programs in surgical patients was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar (1966-2015). Keywords searched included 'enhanced recovery' and 'fast track'. Studies using at least 4 components of the ERAS program were included. Primary outcomes analyzed were length of stay (LOS), overall mortality, readmission within 30 days, and total costs. Total complications, time to first flatus, and time to first bowel movement were also analyzed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 42 RCTs involving 5,241 patients (2,595 receiving ERAS and 2,646 receiving standard of care) were analyzed. ERAS programs significantly reduced LOS by 2.35 days (MD = -2.345; 95%CI, -2.733 to -1.958; p&lt;0.001), total complications by 38.0% (RR=0.620; 95%CI 0.545 &ndash; 0.704; p&lt;0.001), and total costs (SMD= -0.789; 95%CI, -1.093 to -0.485; p&lt;0.001). LOS reductions varied by type of surgery, with a 3 day reduction after orthopedic surgery (p=0.017) and no significant reduction after cardiovascular surgery (p=0.073). Return of gastrointestinal (GI) function was also significantly improved, as measured by earlier time to first flatus (SMD= -0.987; 95%CI, -1.389 to -0.585, p&lt;0.001) and time to first bowel movement (SMD= -1.074; 95%CI, -1.396 to -0.752; p&lt;0.001). Overall mortality was reduced by 29.2% (RR=0.708; 95%CI 0.377 &ndash; 1.330; p=0.283). Overall, there was no difference in readmission rates within 30 days (RR=1.151; 95%CI 0.822&ndash;1.612, p=0.412); however, readmission rates within 30 days after upper GI surgeries nearly doubled with the use of ERAS programs (RR=1.922; 95%CI 1.111 &ndash; 3.324; p=0.019).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: ERAS programs are associated with a significant reduction in LOS, total complications, total costs, as well as earlier return of GI function. Overall mortality rates remained similar, but readmission rates varied significantly depending on the type of surgery. ERAS programs are effective and a valuable part in improving patient outcomes and accelerating recovery after surgery.

Providers lack efficient methods for identifying patients' goals and values, and treatment selection is often based on ambiguous criteria with limited patient input.  We developed and pilot tested an app to help providers understand patients' treatment preferences, facilitating shared decision making by identifying compatibile treatment choices.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Focus groups were used to explore themes, terminology, and treatment attributes patients with severe PAD (rest pain and/or tissue loss) consider important.  Transcripts were analyzed using thematic content analysis.  An iPad app was developed to characterize how individuals prioritize key treatment attributes, including: treatment type (i.e., medication, percutaneous procedure, or surgery), anticipated level of symptomatic improvement, odds of success versus failure, risk, and durability.  These attributes were presented using 14 randomly ordered pair-wise choice tasks with varying levels for each attribute based on an orthogonal array design.  Responses were used to determine part-worth utilities and generate patient-specific scores indicating the relative importance of each attribute.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 26 patients with severe PAD participated in focus groups, and a separate group of 34 participants completed the discrete choice survey in clinic. Mean choice task completion time  was 12.8&plusmn;6.0 minutes.   Aggregate importance scores indicated that treatment type was most influential (41%), followed by chance of successful treatment outcome (24%), risk (18%), durability (10%), and level of symptomatic response (7%).  Analysis on a per-patient level, however, demonstrated that attributes are prioritized differently between individuals (Figure), often supporting individualized choices based on the patient's personal goals and values.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patient treatment preferences are based on complex values systems that differ between individuals with similar PAD severity.   Choice-based survey tools can be used to evaluate patient preferences in an objective and quantitative fashion, allowing providers to access information that is otherwise difficult and time-intensive to obtain during a standard clinic visit.  Understanding patient's goals and values has potential to facilitate individualized treatment choices based on the patient's unique priorities, goals, and values.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient-Centered Outcomes","Cross Disciplinary"

This study was designed to evaluate how patients prepare for transitions of surgical care, and to explore the association between utilization of health information resources with readmission.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in March 2015 among nationwide members of Health Alliance web-based social communities who reported having direct experience with surgery as either a patient or caregiver.  Respondents were asked to report on how prepared they were for the transition of care before and after their most recent surgery, what health information resources they used to get prepared, and whether they required readmission within 30-days following surgery.   Survey results were analyzed using bivariate methods.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of 1872 surveyed individuals, 93% were patients and 79% had undergone surgery within the past year.  Respondents' exposure to surgery represented a broad spectrum of ten major disciplines with Orthopedic (28%) and General Surgery (14%) being most common.  The majority of respondents felt very prepared prior to undergoing surgery (64%) and before leaving the hospital after surgery (65%).   As compared to patients who reported being unprepared, those who felt prepared for transitions of surgical care were most likely to be given multiple health information resources before surgery (97% vs. 79%, p=&lt;0.001) and before leaving the hospital (91% vs. 85%, p=0.02), which included face-to-face meetings, written instructions, internet sites, videos, and smartphone applications.  Feeling prepared was significantly associated with the number of resources that patients were provided by their surgical team and used before surgery (Figure 1) and before leaving the hospital.  30-Day readmission was significantly lower among patients who felt prepared either before (8% vs. 23%; p=&lt;0.001) or after surgery (9% vs. 23%, p=&lt;0.001).  Furthermore, use of any post-operative resource was associated with a significantly lower 30-day readmission (10% vs 31%, p=&lt;0.001) as compared to patients who reported no health information utilization.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Patients who report using more health information resources before and after surgery felt more prepared for transitions of surgical care and have a lower rate of 30-day readmission.

The emergence of electronic health records (EHRs), computerized order entry (CPOE), and patient portals has transformed the way health information is stored, used, and communicated to patients. The effect of such technologies on surgical practice has not been well studied. Our objective is to systematically review the available evidence regarding the impact of health information technology (HIT) on the care of surgical patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library to identify data-driven, non-survey, studies on the effect of HIT, EHR, CPOE or patient portals on surgeons and their patients was performed. Experts in clinical informatics were also queried for known relevant articles to compile for review. Two authors independently reviewed abstracts to select relevant publications that met the inclusion criteria, followed by a full-text review of relevant articles, according to the PRISMA guidelines.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 2909 citations from 4 databases were identified, with 2879 publications remaining after duplicates were removed and the addition of expert-recommended articles. 190 articles were retrieved for full-text analysis, and 23 articles, including 21 observational studies and 2 RCTs, were found applicable. EHR and CPOE systems improved appropriate and timely antibiotic administration for surgical procedures in 6 observational studies. 5 observational studies indicated electronically generated operative notes have increased accuracy, completeness, and timely availability in the medical record compared to dictated notes. The Internet as an informative resource was inadequate for surgical procedures in 2 observational studies; however, a tailored web-based program decreased perioperative anxiety of patients in a single small-scale RCT. In observational studies, patient web portals showed high adoption and utilization, encompassing an increasing proportion of outpatient surgical encounters.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Overall, the quality of evidence on HIT in surgical practice found was moderate to low with only 2 RCTs identified. Currently available data suggest EHR, CPOE, and electronic notes are effective at improving the accuracy of drug administration and operative reports, but few other effects are known. While patient portals are in use, data is lacking on the quality or effect of portal encounters, and the Internet alone has not proven to be a reliable information source. With the increasing use of HIT in surgical patient care, further evidence-based research is required to optimize its utilization and efficacy.","Outcomes/Clinical","Health Informatics","Cross Disciplinary"

We hypothesized that timing of post-discharge surgery clinic visits is associated with readmission risk following gastrointestinal surgery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using VASQIP data we identified patients discharged following gastrointestinal surgery with at least a two-day postoperative length of stay in VA facilities between years 2008-2014.  Our independent variable of interest was the occurrence of a postoperative general surgery clinic visit identified in the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW).  Our outcomes were 10-day and 30-day hospital readmission rates.  To evaluate the association of clinic visit and hospital readmission, we used cox-proportional hazard models with general surgery clinic visit as a time-varying covariate and controlled for patient, procedure, and inpatient stay factors associated with readmission.  To assess whether timing of clinic visits was associated with readmission, we performed a facility level analysis and tested the association between facility rate of readmission and mean time from discharge to initial clinic visit using Pearson correlation.  Facilities performing less than twenty surgeries were excluded.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 85,219 patients discharged after undergoing inpatient gastrointestinal surgery, hospital readmissions occurred in 6218 (7.3%) patients within 10-days and in 10,451 (12.3%) within-30-days.  A general surgery visit was recorded in 28,933 (33.9%) patients within 10 days following discharge and in 59,279 (69.5%) within 30-days.  Overall, the median time to readmission was 8 days (IQR: 4-16), and the median time to clinic visit was 11 days (IQR 7-15). Only 2,810 (26.9%) of patients readmitted within 30-days had a preceding general surgery clinic visit.  Having a postoperative general surgery clinic visit was associated with a significantly decreased hazard of readmission within 10 days (HR 0.64, 95%CI 0.59-0.70) and 30-days (HR 0.63, 95%CI 0.60-0.66) of discharge.

Previous studies within the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) have led to the implementation of a six-element perioperative care bundle for colectomy. The aim of this study was to determine the value (quality and cost) implications of implementation of these bundled perioperative care measures in Michigan.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified 3,387 patients in the MSQC database who underwent colon surgery from 2012 to 2015. The patient population was stratified into two groups based on compliance: low compliance for adherence to 0-2 perioperative care measures and high compliance for adherence to 3-6 perioperative care measures. Factors potentially associated with SSI were tested using univariate statistical tests. Payment data (patient level) was aggregated in collaboration with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. Model adjustment covariates included patient demographic factors, clinical factors, case mix, and clustering of patients within hospitals.  Adjustments were made to payments to manage hospital-level contractual differences in BCBSM episode payments. A hierarchical generalized linear model was created to test for independent associations between perioperative care measures, SSI and cost. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The high compliance and low compliance group had risk-adjusted SSI rates of 8.2% (95% CI, 7.21-9.2%) and 16.0% (95% CI, 12.9-19.1%), respectively. This correlates to an absolute risk reduction of 7.8% (p&lt;0.01).  When compared with low compliance, the high compliance group had an absolute risk reduction of 3.6% (p&lt;0.01), 2.9% (p&lt;0.01) and 1.3% (p&lt;0.01) for SSI rates in superficial space, deep space, and organ space, respectively.Low compliance cases had an average episodic cost of $20,046 (95% CI, $17,281-$22,812) while high compliance cases had a total episodic cost of $15,272 (95% CI, $14,354-$16,192).

There were 4 relevant management groups: Group 1(stenting alone); Group 2(stenting followed by resection within 14 days;'bridge to surgery'); Group 3(primary resection with anastomosis); and Group 4(stoma creation with or without resection). Outcomes were major complications, readmission, reoperation, mortality, LOS, and discharge disposition.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 2,435 patients were treated for MLBO from Oct. 2009 to Dec. 2013. 235 patients underwent stenting alone (Group 1). 57 patients had stenting as their initial procedure followed by resection within 2 weeks (Group 2). 1,388 patients had a primary resection with anastomosis (Group 3) and 755 had a stoma creation (Group 4). Group 2 had a trend towards better outcomes; given the small number (n = 57) and inability to reach statistical significance, these patients were removed from analysis. Among the remaining 3 groups, there were no statistically significant differences between age, gender, or comorbidity but whites were more likely to undergo primary resection (58.8%, 33.1%, 8.1%, p=0.01).  High volume centers were more likely to perform stenting compared to low volume centers (19.4% vs 3.5%;p&lt;0.01). LOS was shortest in the stent group (8 days vs 12 days (group 3) and 13 days (group 4); p&lt;0.01) There were no differences in major complication rates between Group 1, 3, and 4 during the index hospitalization and 90 days post-procedure.

Investigating the reasons for readmissions is necessary in order to help hospitals identify targets for improvement. Surgical site infections (SSI) have been found to be the main contributing factor to readmissions. Hospitals may differ in how they manage post-discharge SSIs (e.g. if they manage patients in an outpatient clinic), and thus readmissions for SSI may be a useful hospital-level quality indicator.  Our objectives were to (1) investigate the variation that exists between hospitals with their rates of readmissions for SSI and (2) assess patient- and hospital level factors associated with readmissions.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients undergoing a colectomy at hospitals enrolled in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program throughout January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013 were included in the study population. Readmission rates and indications for those readmissions were assessed. Proportional hazards models were developed to examine risk-adjusted hospital variation and the association of patient and hospital factors with readmissions for SSI. We then ranked the hospitals in our study by their odds ratios, and calculated the correlation of this rank with overall hospital risk-adjusted SSI rates as well as overall hospital risk-adjusted readmission rates<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Based on 30,876 patients from 145 hospitals, the rate of readmissions for SSI was 1.07%. Hospital risk-adjusted odds ratios for readmissions for SSIs varied from 0.40 to 2.80. 4 hospitals performed significantly better than expected (2.8%), and 5 hospitals performed significantly worse than expected (3.5%). Hospital performance regarding readmissions for SSI was not correlated with overall hospital risk-adjusted SSI rates or readmission rates (r=.30 and r=.026, respectively). Risk factors for readmissions for SSIs include class III obesity (HR, 1.95; CI, 1.3 &ndash; 2.93; P &lt; .01), ASA class III (HR, 1.79, CI, 1.32-2.3, P&lt;.001), smoking status (HR 1.32; CI, 1.01 &ndash; 1.71, P = .04), current steroid use (HR 1.58; CI, 1.09 &ndash; 2.28, P = .02), operative times over 100 minutes (P &lt; .001), and open surgery (P&lt;.01). There was a non-significant trend for larger hospitals to have higher readmission for SSI rates (P=.18). A resident-to-bed ratio under 0.3 was also a risk factor for readmission for SSI (P&lt;.01) compared to higher ratios.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Readmission for SSI rates represents a unique aspect of quality beyond that offered by just SSI and overall readmission rates alone.  The rate of unplanned readmissions for SSI is a novel quality indicator that may provide actionable quality improvement information for hospitals.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

With more hospital consolidations as an inevitable part of our future healthcare ecosystem, we investigated the relationship between hospital consolidations and surgical outcomes. We hypothesize that hospital consolidations improve surgical outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a retrospective study spanning 2007-2013 in the states of CA and FL using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database, AHA Annual Survey Database, and Medicare's Case Mix Index data. We identified 19 hospitals that consolidated over the study period and propensity matched the 19 hospitals with 19 independent hospitals using patient and hospital characteristics. Differences-in-differences analysis was used to compare the change in the risk-adjusted complication rate of 7 elective surgeries 1 year prior to consolidation and the year following consolidation between the consolidation hospitals and matched control group. Our complication index included post-op pulmonary failure, MI, renal failure, PNA, DVT, PE, SSI, hemorrhage, and GI bleed. Based on ProPublica's surgeon scorecard, the elective surgeries included laparoscopic cholecystectomy, transurethral prostatectomy, cervical fusion of the anterior column (anterior technique), lumbar and lumbosacral fusion of the anterior/posterior column (posterior technique), total hip replacement, and total knee replacement.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the 7 procedures studied, 2 procedures saw a decrease in complication rate (lumbar and lumbosacral fusion of the posterior column posterior technique, DID=-0.6, p&lt;0.01; total hip replacement, DID=-0.6, p&lt;0.01), 3 procedures saw an increase in complication rate (TURP, DID=4.1, p&lt;0.01; cervical fusion of the anterior column anterior technique, DID=1.5, p&lt;0.01; total knee replacement, DID=0.3, p&lt;0.01), and 2 procedures saw no change in complication rate (laparoscopic cholecystectomy, lumbar and lumbosacral fusion of the anterior column posterior technique, both p&gt;0.05) following a hospital consolidation. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Arguments have been made that consolidated health care systems can share high-performing clinical services and infrastructure resources such as electronic medical records to improve quality. Our results indicate that hospital consolidations result in improved outcomes, but not uniformly. Undoubtedly, many factors affect surgical outcomes following consolidation, such as volume, hospital perioperative resources, reason for consolidating, leadership, and physician factors.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Advances in machine learning, computing, and data availability have led to superior predictions in many disciplines by automating the process of variable selection in the context of vast amounts of data. Based on wisdom-of-crowds literature, we hypothesized that an ensemble, or average, of machine-learning prediction models would outperform mortality predictions issued by the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACSNSQIP).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Preoperative characteristics and mortality outcomes from the ACSNSQIP Participant Use Files (PUF) 2005-2013 were used to form mortality predictions. The data were split into training and testing sets. The free open-source R statistical software was utilized on Microsoft's Azure cloud environment to parallel-process variable selection and mortality predictions. Two machine-learning algorithms&mdash;regularized logistic regression and random forest&mdash;were fit to the training set to generate probabilistic mortality predictions for each observation in the testing set. The two model predictions were averaged to form an ensemble prediction. The primary outcome was the improved accuracy of mortality predictions of the ensemble compared to those of the ACSNSQIP model. The Brier score, a measure of accuracy represented by the mean squared difference between the predicted probability and actual outcome for a set of individual observations, was used to evaluate performance. Significance was determined using the Amisano-Giacomini test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Models were trained on 1,847,818 records, and predictions were tested on 615,939 records. The regularized logistic regression selected 93 predictors, including 11 new variables engineered using ACSNQIP PUF data. The random forest utilized 86 selected predictors, including 17 newly engineered variables. Predictions of the ensemble outperformed ACSNSQIP predictions as measured by Brier scores where lower is better (0.009854 vs. 0.009904, p=0.0065), representing a mean improvement of 0.5% over ACSNSQIP predictions.

Given the epidemic of opioid-related morbidity and mortality, it is critical to understand how opioid use impacts surgical outcomes. In this context, we examined the effect of preoperative opioid use on clinical and financial outcomes in adults undergoing major elective abdominal surgery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively reviewed 2460 patients drawn from a statewide surgical quality collaborative database who underwent elective abdominopelvic surgery at a single center between 2008-2014. We identified preoperative opioid use from the medical record at the anesthesia preoperative evaluation (day of operation). Opioid use was categorized first as any opioid use (binary) and then as none vs. short-acting only vs. long-acting +/- short-acting. Outcomes included 90 day total hospital costs, hospital length of stay (LOS), discharge destination, 30 day hospital readmissions, and 30 day major complication rates. Standard multivariate regression techniques were used to adjust for case complexity and patient-specific risk factors (age, ASA class, functional status, smoking, medical comorbidities). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:497 patients (20%) used opioids preoperatively. After covariate adjustment, opioid users (compared to opioid-na&iuml;ve) had higher mean costs ($27091 vs. $24307, P&lt;0.01), longer mean LOS (6.0 vs 5.2 days, P&lt;0.01), increased readmissions (10% vs 6%, P&lt;0.01), higher complication rates (20% vs. 16%, P=0.04), but there was no significant difference in non-home discharge rates (14% vs. 11%, P=0.11). Surgical site infection, sepsis, and postop transfusion were significantly more common in opioid users. When categorized by short vs. long-acting opioids, both levels of opioid use were significantly associated with costs, LOS, and readmissions in multivariate analyses. The effect of long-acting opioids was stronger than that of short-acting opioids across all outcomes (except discharge destination). The figure shows a stepwise increase in adjusted mean costs and LOS across categories of opioid use, with long-acting opioid users having the highest costs and LOS. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Opioid use is common prior to abdominal surgery and is associated with increased healthcare utilization and morbidity, even after risk-adjustment. Preoperative opioids represent a potentially modifiable risk factor and a novel target for surgical quality improvement. Going forward, strategies to reduce opioid use and implement alternative pain management options may improve the quality and value of surgical care in this vulnerable patient population.","Outcomes/Clinical","Quality of Care","Cross Disciplinary"

This Cross National Survey of Deafness started as collaboration between the University of Miami Florida, USA and my institution and it was sponsored by the grants from the National Institute of Health and Tertiary Education Trust Fund of Nigeria.

The participants were selected from various vocational and professional groups, schools and religious groups and using questionnaire, deafness was identified as hereditary and acquired.  Blood samples were collected from those identified with hereditary deafness and DNA was extracted using a salting-out method with Qiagen, followed by genotyping using Sanger and Next Generation sequencing for the identification of the gene mutation.

Specifically, the BSP focuses on treatment of four common digestive diseases (appendicitis, paralytic ileus and intestinal obstruction, inguinal and femoral hernia, and gallbladder and bile duct disease), four maternal-neonatal conditions (maternal hemorrhage, obstructed labor, abortion, and neonatal encephalopathy), and injuries that could be treated with basic interventions.

Perhaps a common cause of trauma-related mortality in these settings comes from the rapid expansion of motor vehicle ownership without the corresponding national pre-hospital training in developed countries. The resulting road traffic injuries often never make it to the hospital in time for effective treatment, resulting in preventable disability and death. The current paper examines the program evaluation of medical first responder training that has the potential to reduce this unnecessary morbidity and mortality.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An intensive training workshop has been differentiated into two progressive tiers: Acute Trauma Training (ATT) and Broad Trauma Training (BTT) protocols. These four-hour and two-day protocols, respectively, allow for the mass education of laypersons&mdash;such as police officials, fire brigade, and taxi/ambulance drivers&mdash;who are most likely to interact first with pre-hospital victims. Over 750 ATT participants and 168 BTT participants were trained across three Indian educational institutions at Jodhpur and Jaipur. Trainees were given didactic and hands-on education in a series of critical trauma topics, in addition to pre- and post-survey self-assessments to rate clinical confidence across curricular topics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A variety of career backgrounds enrolled both in our ATT and BTT workshops, run by local physicians with a spectrum of medical specialties as well as ATT-trained police officials.

Correlation and multivariate linear regression analysis was performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 142,738 trauma admissions were identified of which 21,540 were due to intentional trauma. DJI significantly correlated with intentional trauma admissions (p=0.004). After adjusting for unemployment rate, crime rate, state population, and time trend DJI was independently associated with intentional trauma admissions (&beta;= -0.224, 95% CI= -0.448 &ndash; -0.02, p=0.04). For every 1000 unit decrease in DJI, intentional trauma admissions increased by 0.22 per month.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Variation in economic conditions independently impacts intentional trauma admissions independently. A nation wide evaluation may help in identifying additional social factors and the true nature of this association.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

In light of the recent Lancet Commission on Global Surgery recommendations on indicators of capacity and outcomes, we sought to understand the volume of surgery and outcomes for public hospitals in Mexico in 2014. We also assessed four common procedures &ndash; cesarean delivery, appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and groin hernia repair &ndash; to better understand access to basic surgical care. Finally, we evaluated the number of clinicians available to provide care.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We queried the online public database of the Ministry of Health in Mexico to obtain information on the volume of operations occurring in public hospitals. We used ICD10 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes reported per hospital discharge by state in 2014, filtered by procedure type, to ascertain the number of reported surgical procedures. We also identified deaths during hospitalizations that included a surgical procedure. We evaluated four commonly performed operations &ndash;cesarean delivery, appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and groin hernia repair&ndash; to assess both specific volume and proportion of total surgical volume. We also obtained in-hospital deaths, population data, and number of general and specialized surgeons and obstetricians/gynecologists (Ob/Gyns) in each state.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1,655,468 operations were performed in public hospitals in 2014. Of this total, 22.6% were cesarean deliveries, 4.1% cholecystectomies, 3.6% appendectomies, and 1.8% groin hernia repairs. From these operations 13,277 patients died, yielding a mean case fatality rate (deaths per 1000 procedures) of 8.02. The mean case fatality rate ranged substantially by state (2.59-14.28). Mortality also varied by procedure. The national mean case fatality rate was 0.28 for cesarean deliveries (range 0-0.95 by state), 4.64 for cholecystectomy (range 0.73-12.42 by state), 3.03 for appendectomy (range 0-9.55 by state), and 3.78 for groin hernia repair (range 0-12.64 by per state). We identified 3,910 individual general and specialized surgeons and 4,802 Ob/Gyns. The mean number of providers per 100,000 people was 3.27 (range 0.92 -7.02 by state) for surgeons and 4.01 (range 2.19 &ndash;7.43 by state) for Ob/Gyn. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The national mean case fatality rate for the selected surgical procedures in Mexican public hospitals is low and is comparable to highly developed countries. However, closer examination reveals a large degree of variation by state, by procedure, and by provider density suggesting an opportunity for improvement. National standardized data collection systems are essential for analyzing access and provision of surgical care, and understanding patient outcomes. However, the private sector is not included in this reporting system.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

We trained laywomen to promote breast cancer awareness and perform screening clinical breast exam (CBE) in urban clinics. This is the first breast cancer screening study in Malawi, and the first study in SSA to assess CBE by laywomen delivered with other health services.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Four laywomen were trained to deliver breast cancer educational talks and conduct CBE. After training, screening was implemented in diverse urban health clinics. Eligible women to undergo CBE were &ge;30 years, with no prior breast cancer or breast surgery, and clinic attendance for reasons other than a breast concern. Women with abnormal CBE were referred to a study surgeon. All palpable masses confirmed by surgeon exam were pathologically sampled. Patients with abnormal screening CBE but normal surgeon exam underwent breast ultrasound confirmation. Additionally, 50 randomly selected women with normal screening CBE underwent breast ultrasound, and 45 different women with normal CBE were randomly assigned to surgeon exam.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:175 educational talks were delivered to 4295 people across 5 clinics. Among 1220 eligible women, 1000 (82%) agreed to CBE. Lack of time (68%) was the most common reason for refusal. CBE agreement varied across clinics from 71% to 86% (p=0.001). Women who attended the talk were more likely to accept CBE than women who did not (83% vs 77%, p=0.012). Among 1000 women screened, 7% had abnormal CBE. All 50 women with normal CBE randomized to ultrasound had normal findings. Of 45 women with normal CBE randomized to surgeon exam, 43 had normal surgeon exams and 2 had axillary lymphadenopathy not detected by screening CBE. Sixty of 67 women (90%) with abnormal CBE attended the referral visit. Of these, 29 (48%) had concordant abnormal surgeon exam, and 15 were recommended to have pathologic sampling. Fourteen women had nipple discharge or breast pain identified by both CBE and surgeon exam, which did not require further work-up after surgeon review. Thirty-one women (52%) had discordant normal surgeon exam, all of whom had normal breast ultrasounds. Compared to surgeon exam, sensitivity for CBE by laywomen was 94% (CI 79-99%), specificity 58% (CI 46-70%), positive predictive value 48% (CI 35-62%), and negative predictive value 96% (CI 85-100%). Of 15 women who underwent pathologic sampling, 2 had cytologic dysplasia and are awaiting surgical excision, 7 had fibroadenomas, 2 normal tissue, 1 galactocele, 1 abscess, 1 lymph node with Kaposi sarcoma, and 1 tumoral calcinosis.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Uptake of CBE screening in Lilongwe clinics was high. CBE by laywomen compared favorably with surgeon exam, and follow-up was good. Our intervention can serve as a model for wider implementation.

It has been shown that children with this condition are susceptible to discrimination, emotional problems, lower self-esteem and increased anxiety, affecting their lifestyle even after surgical repair. Globally, there is no data on the impact of this condition on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in older populations (&ge; 25 years). The objective of this study was to assess the HRQoL of unrepaired cases of CLP in a rural population of a lower-middle-income country, where deficiencies in access to care have contributed to an important backlog of adult cases.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A prospective study conducted in the State of Assam, India from Feb 2013 to May 2014. A total of 147 adult (&ge; 18 years) subjects were surveyed, 89 with CLP compared to 58 without CLP. Subjects living throughout the state were recruited at a CLP dedicated hospital in the city of Guwahati (CLP group), and in their home towns (normal group). All subjects completed the World Health Organization HRQoL questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) and comparisons between groups were made for each of the four domains (Physical Health, Psychological, Social Relationships and Environment) of the instrument (scoring range 21-100). Descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests, Pearson&#39;s chi-square test, and general lineal models controlling for age, gender, education level, literacy and occupation were used to analyze the data with a significance threshold set at p&lt;0.05.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: CLP and normal groups were similar in age (median age 30 vs. 30.5; p=0.754), gender (females 49.4% vs. 43.1%; p=0.452), marital status (married/living as married 53.4% vs. 60.3%; p=0.476) religion (Hindu 76.2% vs. 87.8%; p=0.619), annual income (60,000 vs. 72,000 Indian Rupees; p=0.82) and number of people per household (median 5 vs. 5; p= 0.654). Conversely, the cleft group had significantly higher proportion of illiteracy (55.1% vs. 14.3%; p&lt;0.001), no education (51.1% vs. 10.3%; p&lt;0.001) and hand-laborer occupation (74.7% vs. 38.6% farmer/labor industry; p&lt;0.001). Adjusted models revealed a significantly lower mean difference for the Environment domain [5.24 (95% Confidence Interval 0.97-9.51; p=0.016)], and no significant difference for the other domains.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Environmental consequences of unrepaired CLP on HRQoL are present even after childhood. Some of these include financial resources, access/quality to health and social care, participation in recreational/leisure activities, opportunities for acquiring information and skills, physical and home environment, physical safety and security. Given the life long deleterious consequences of living with an unrepaired CLP, more financial resources need to be allocated to understand and treat the backlog of adult CLP cases. Using CLP-tailored instruments instead of generic ones may increase the sensitivity of capturing additional impact of unrepaired CLP on HRQoL.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

Most patients seek care at district hospitals with limited surgical capacity, creating a need for referral. Weaknesses in referral systems lead to delays that contribute to substantial disability and death. This study assesses the predictors of delayed referrals for injured patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This retrospective cohort study included all injured patients between January 1 and December 31, 2013 from three rural district hospitals in Rwanda, with a focused analysis on those recommended for referral. We defined delayed referral as non-execution of referral or execution of referral more than two days after referral recommendation. We performed a multivariate logistic regression using stepwise backward selection to identify the risk factors for delayed referral.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the 1,227 patients with injuries evaluated, 23% (n=282) were recommended for referral. Of these patients, 36.5% were injured through road traffic accidents and 53.6% were diagnosed with closed fractures. Overall, 46.5% (n=107) of the patients recommended for referral had a delay in referral execution. Reasons for delay that were documented in 57 patients' files included awaiting appointment (45.6%, n=26), lack of space at referral hospitals (40.4%, n=23) and financial (14%, n=8).In the multivariate model, the major risk factors for delayed referral included district hospital (OR:3.77, 95% CI: 1.5- 9.18), age &gt;35 years (OR=2.45, 95%CI: 1.09-5.50), closed fractures/dislocation (OR=16.37, 95%CI: 3.13-85.78), admission to surgical wards (OR=10.25, 95%CI: 2.70-38.82) and admission for at least seven days prior to referral recommendation (OR=4.80, 95%CI:1.38-16.63). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Although it is promising that over fifty percent of referrals were completed in a timely fashion, services at district hospitals should be improved to minimize the need for referral.  Specifically, improved availability of surgical infrastructure, equipment, supplies, and trained staff at district hospitals may improve the execution of timely and appropriate referrals. Further, patient-centered programs to facilitate referral and support patient expenses may contribute to timely referral and should be further studied.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

This study sought to characterize UGI bleeding at a tertiary care hospital in sub-Saharan Africa and the role of endoscopy in management. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A prospective analysis of adult patients (age &ge; 18 years) presenting with a clinical diagnosis of UGI bleed to Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in Lilongwe, Malawi over two years was performed (October 2011 &ndash; September 2013). Patient characteristics and both short and long-term outcomes were recorded. Long-term outcomes were recorded in an outpatient clinic or via communication with family. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were used to compare endoscopy and non-endoscopy patient cohorts.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 293 patients were included in the study. Mean age was 41.8 years (SD &plusmn; 15.8) with an overall male preponderance (62.9%). 38.9% (n=114) received endoscopy. There were no differences between the endoscopy and non-endoscopy cohorts in clinical history, physical exam, vital signs, laboratory studies, or imaging findings. However, patients who received endoscopy received more blood transfusions (mean 1.9 vs. 1.5 units, p=0.0108) and were more often medicated with beta-blockers (71.1 vs. 55.3%, p=0.007). In the endoscopy cohort, 64.9% (n=74) had findings of esophageal or gastric varices and 43.0% (n=49) of these had endoscopic banding. Length of stay was longer for patients who received endoscopy (14.9 vs. 8.7 days, p&lt;0.001) but mortality was substantially lower in the endoscopy cohort (4.4 vs. 12.9%, p=0.016). The adjusted odds ratio for mortality for patients not receiving endoscopy was 3.53 (CI 1.25-9.99, p=0.017). Outpatient follow-up rates were similar between the two cohorts (31.3 vs. 29.0%, p=0.671). At follow-up, there were similar rates of repeat upper gastrointestinal bleed (5.6 vs. 6.1%, p=0.843) and post-hospitalization mortality (5.0 vs. 6.1%, p=0.683) between the endoscopy and the non-endoscopy cohorts.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Diagnostic endoscopy with or without therapeutic intervention had a significant in-hospital mortality benefit for patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleed even with a relatively low utilization rate. Varices were the most common cause and these patients responded well to banding.

Our objectives were to formally evaluate national performance on these melanoma quality indicators and to examine patient, tumor, and hospital characteristics associated with adherence.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This retrospective observational study used the 2012 National Cancer Data Base to identify patients with invasive, non-metastatic melanoma. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on theCoC definition of each measure.  Patient-level and hospital-level-adherence rates were calculated for the 5 measures. A hospital was deemed 'adherent' if it met the CoC standard, which requires 90% of patients to receive the measure-specific recommended care. Patient, tumor, and hospital characteristics potentially associated with higher likelihood of adherence at the patient-level were estimated using hierarchical random effects logistic regression models to account for hospital-level clustering.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 31,598 patients from 1343 hospitals were examined. Patient-level adherence rates varied from 31.6% (Measure #5: &ge;10 lymph nodes removed/examined in axillary dissections) to 72.6% (Measure #1: sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) overuse measure). Hospital-level adherence rates ranged from 19.3% for Measure #5 (n=538 hospitals) to 56.2% for Measure #1 (n=1090 hospitals). To improve Measure #1's specifications, patients with high-risk features (ulceration, mitoses, age&lt;40 years) were excluded from the measure's denominator as SLNB in these patients remains controversial, with a resultant improvement in the patient-level adherence rate (original measure: 72.6%; modified measure: 83.8%, p&lt;0.001); with these adjustments, 277 (20.6%) more hospitals would achieve the 90% threshold and pass Measure #1. Only 319 (24%) hospitals would pass all 5 measures, and most hospitals would pass 3 measures or fewer (53%). No hospital-level factors (e.g., teaching status, case volume) were consistently associated with better adherence.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: National adherence rates to the 5 new CoC melanoma quality metrics is low and most hospitals would not meet the CoC requirement of 90% adherence. Feedback of these measures to hospitals may be an impetus for improving guideline adherence, but the measures need refinement to adequately capture the nuances of melanoma care before being used for accreditation purposes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Thus, CD8 count is used as a marker of prognosis and response to immune therapy in clinical trials. Increases in CD8 T cells between pre- and post-treatment biopsies may reflect response to immune therapy, which is increasingly important for assessing effects of combination immunotherapies. Tumor heterogeneity may complicate these measures, but there are insufficient data to address heterogeneity when tracking changes in CD8 infiltrates.  Furthermore, there is a need to assess differences in immune infiltration between synchronous and subsequent tumors. We hypothesized that variation of CD8 T cell counts among different samples of the same or synchronous metastases would be limited to a coefficient of variation (CV) of less than 50% of the mean.  We also hypothesized that CD8 counts would decrease over time between metachronous tumors.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed from 197 melanoma formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors from 154 patients, of which 27 had 2 or more tumors resected at different times, and six patients had 2 tumors resected simultaneously. For each tumor, up to four 1 mm diameter tissue cores were included in the TMA. The number of CD8 T cells per core was determined by immunohistochemistry. Mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV = SD/mean) were calculated for tumors with 3-4 evaluable cores (N=175). In patients with metachronous tumors, CD8 counts of the first and second tumors were compared with a paired T-test. For simultaneous metastases, CD8 counts were studied for differences in decile ranks among all 197 tumors.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:CD8 counts varied widely among different cores of the same tumors (average CV 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.84).  The CV was greater for lower means (CV&gt;0.7 for mean &lt;134 CD8/mm<sup>2</sup>, CV&lt;0.5 for &gt;294 CD8/mm<sup>2</sup>).  The inverse association of CV with the mean was significant (r = -0.38, p&lt;0.0001). Among the 6 patients with simultaneous excision of two tumors, 4 pairs of tumors had counts in the same decile, 1 differed by 1 decile and 1 by 2 deciles. Among the 27 patients with metachronous tumors, if the first tumor had CD8 counts higher than the median (84 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>), CD8 counts decreased by 47% in the second tumor (p=0.005). For those with CD8 counts lower than the median, CD8 counts trended higher in the second tumor (p=0.058, +140%).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Heterogeneity among tumor samples was greater than hypothesized, but means across 3-4 cores were similar between synchronous metastases.  In patients, differences in CD8 T cell counts after treatment may be explained by heterogeneity if tumor samples are small and especially if differences are less than 2-fold. The impact of tumor heterogeneity on CD8 T cell counts may be minimized by taking multiple samples of each tumor and powering clinical trials to allow for heterogeneity.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Clinical outcomes after operative intervention and prognostic factors associated with long-term survival remain poorly understood.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We queried the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER) to identify patients with malignant sarcoma of the liver from 1988 to 2012. Demographic factors, tumor characteristics, resection status, and long-term survival were evaluated. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of survival. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 734 patients with primary malignant sarcoma of the liver were identified.  The median age of diagnosis was 58 years and the majority of patients were men (54.8%).  The median tumor size was 10cm. Based on SEER clinical stage, the patients were evenly distributed by extent of disease (localized disease 29%, regional disease 25%, and distant disease 34%, unstaged 11.6%).). Only 30% of patients in the cohort underwent surgery.

Survival was modestly better for low grade vs. high grade tumors, but did not reach statistical significance (5 year: 68.2% vs 47.9%; p=0.244).  Tumor size did not influence prognosis (e.g., &lt;10 cm vs &gt;10 cm: 54.2% vs. 57.1%; p=0.973).  While transplantation was uncommon (20 cases in entire cohort) survival seemed to be poorer than after resection (even for tumors less than 5 cm, 5 year survival 42.9%, vs 63.9%, respectively, p=0.317).  On multivariate analysis, surgery and female sex were associated with improved survival, while older age, advanced stage, and angiosarcoma histology were the strongest independent predictors of poor survival. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This is the largest US series  of primary malignant sarcoma of the liver analyzed to date. Histologic subtype, more so than tumor size or differentiation, is the dominant factor determining outcomes..

Given that data on survival of patients with RPS are conflicting, we sought to use a nationwide cancer database to define factors associated with survival in patients with RPS. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results (SEER) database was utilized to identify patients with RPS from 2002 to 2012. Univariable and multivariable survival analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazard models. Since the underlying hazard function was not proportional, a relative time (Time Ratio) to event (cause-specific mortality) was modeled using a generalized gamma parametric survival function. Exposures of interest included age, sex, race, anatomical region, histological type (using ICD-O-3 codes), grade, size, local extension, lymph node and distant metastases, surgery, and radiation. Choice of appropriate modeling technique was based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) values.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 2,920 patients were included; median age was 63 (IQR: 52-73) years, and 51.6% were female. The most common histological subtypes were liposarcoma (46.9%) and leiomyosarcoma (25.0%). The majority of tumors (84.5%) were &lt;5 cm in size, 42.3% were high grade, and 39.5% had extension to adjacent organs/structures. About three quarters (75.6%) of patients underwent surgical resection, 25.9% had radiation therapy, and 21.6% received both. Overall 5- and 10-year survival were 57.1% and 38.9%, respectively. On multivariable survival analysis, increasing age, histological type (leiomyosarcoma, sarcoma not otherwise specified and others, as compared to liposarcoma), higher grade, increasing size, local extension, and presence of lymph node and distant metastasis were associated with increased risk of death (all p&lt;0.05). After controlling for other factors, patients undergoing surgical resection survived 2.5 times longer than patients who did not undergo surgery (95% CI: 2.1-3.0, p&lt;0.001). Patients who received radiation therapy survived 1.4 times longer than patients who did not receive radiation (95% CI: 1.2-1.7, p&lt;0.001). A similar additive benefit of radiation was seen in the sub-cohort of patients who underwent surgery [Time Ratio: 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.7), p=0.002] (Figure). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Over the last decade RPS patients treated with radiation demonstrate longer survival compared with patients who did not receive radiation. This relationship was observed both among patients undergoing surgical resection, as well as among patients who did not undergo surgery. Further study is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the radiation-related survival benefit observed in this study.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

In this study we are the first to investigate whether adherence to this guideline by treatment centers is associated with improved patient survival in a large, multi-institutional dataset.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Cancer Data Base from 1998-2012 was queried for patients undergoing pancreatic resection for adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head. Adherence to NCCN guidelines was measured by calculating the proportion of patients who had at least 11 lymph nodes (LN) examined at a given treatment center. This proportion was subsequently used in a Cox proportional hazards model with shared frailty was used to evaluate its association with patient survival while controlling for random effects at the level of treatment center.

Median yearly treatment center volume ranged from 1 to 86 cases (median 2, IQR 2-4.25). The median proportion of patients having 11 LNs examined at a specific center was 40% (IQR 22.6%-56.7%).

However after adjusting for other covariates and center-specific variation (Table 1), a 10 percent increase in adherence to the 11 LN guideline only revealed a modest association with improved survival (HR 0.97, p = 0.002). Finally in a hierarchical regression analysis clustering within treatment centers accounted for only 15.3% of the variance in the number of nodes examined.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While our results confirm that nodal yield after resection for pancreatic head adnenocarcinoma is associated with survival in node-negative patients, they also show that its utility as a quality metric is limited.

These metabolic perturbations, as well as increased production of cytokines from visceral adipose tissue, negatively affect hepatocyte proliferation. Data on the impact of obesity on liver regeneration after major liver hepatectomy are lacking. As such, we sought to compare the liver volume regeneration index (RI) among patients by body mass indexes (BMI).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: : Patients undergoing a major hepatectomy (&ge;3 segments) between July 2004 and April 2015 with available pre- and postoperative computed tomographic (CT) scans were identified. Patients were stratified by preoperative BMI; normal BMI (&lt;25), overweight (25-29), and obese (&ge;30). Patients were matched on the number of segments resected, as well as the remnant liver volume (RLV) to total liver volume (TLV) ratio. TLV was assessed preoperatively, while RLV was measured at 2-3 and 6-7 months after surgery. The resected volume at surgery was subtracted from TLV to define postoperative RLV (RLV<sub>p</sub>). The liver volume RI was defined as the relative increase within 2-3 months [(RLV<sub>2-3m</sub>-RLV<sub>p</sub>)/RLV<sub>p</sub>] and 6-7 months [(RLV<sub>6-7m</sub>-RLV<sub>p</sub>)/RLV<sub>p</sub>] after surgery.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Among a matched cohort of 80 patients, median age was 58 years (IQR, 49.7-68.6) and most were male (53.8%). Of note, while clinicopathological characteristics were similar across the three groups, obese patients presented with a higher incidence of diabetes (normal, 10% vs. overweight, 33.3% vs. obese, 46.2%; P=0.01). 48.7% of patients underwent a right hepatectomy while 25.0% and 26.3% underwent a left or extended hepatectomy, respectively. Obese patients had a higher median blood loss (normal, 300cc vs. overweight, 500cc vs. obese, 800 cc; P&lt;0.001) and were more likely to be transfused (normal; 3.9% vs. overweight; 13.6% vs. obese; 30.4%, P=0.04).

Demographics, operative variables and post-operative complications were all compared and considered significant at p&lt;=0.05.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We identified 280 patients who underwent MIE with a mean age of 65.65 &plusmn; 10.5 and a median follow-up of 48 months.   Fifty-seven patients underwent IVL, 78 underwent TH, and 145 underwent RAIL.  The length of operation was significantly longer in IVL and RAIL approaches compared to TH (TH=242 min, IVL=320 min, RAIL=415 min, p=0.001). Mean estimated blood loss did not differ between cohorts (TH=150 mL, IVL=125 mL, RAIL=158 mL, p=0.8). Rates of anastomotic leak, stricture, pneumonia, and wound infections were all higher in the TH compared to the trans-thoracic approaches p=0.04, p=0.02, p=0.01, and p&lt;0.001 respectively (Table 1.).  Operative mortality was low for each cohort and did not differ between approaches (TH=2.6%, IVL=0%, RAIL=2%, p=0.2). The median length of hospitalization also did not differ between groups (TH=10 days, IVL=8.5 days, RAIL=9 days, p=0.15). Oncologic outcomes were measured by completeness of resection and nodal harvest. There was decreased R1 resections in both the IVL and RAIL compared to TH (TH=8%, IVL=0%, and RAIL=0% p=0.04).

Patients on pathway receive: clear liquid diet on post-operative day 1, diet progression as tolerated, early oral pain control, and discontinuation of IV fluids when tolerating a post-gastrectomy diet and oral pain medications.  Variations of these principles had been employed previously, but not uniformly, among gastric surgeons at our center.  We do not routinely place naso-jejeunal tubes or enteral feeding tubes, and only image the esophago-jejeunal anastomosis when clinically indicated.  All curative intent gastrectomies performed within two years of standardization were reviewed to determine the effect standardization had on time to oral feeding, oral pain medication, length of stay, complications, and readmissions. Differences between groups were examined using a ranksum test for continuous variables and chi2 test for categorical variables; significance was defined as p &lt;0.05.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Between June 2007 and July 2011, 111 patients underwent curative intent total gastrectomy, 53 patients prior to standardization (pre) and 58 patients afterwards (post).

Individual abstracted metrics included specific diagnosis and extent of liver resection. Major hepatectomy was defined as resection of &gt; 3 liver segments. Mortality was defined as death occurring within 30 days of the date of surgery. Composite overall morbidity was defined as the occurrence of surgical site infection, wound disruption, pneumonia, unplanned intubation, pulmonary embolism, &gt; 48 hour ventilator, renal failure, urinary tract infection, stroke or cerebral vascular accident, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, or systemic sepsis. The NSQIP estimated probabilities of morbidity and mortality were used to include an overall adjustment for confounding effects, including age and preoperative comorbidities. Multivariable models were used to estimate the effects of extent of resection, estimated probabilities of morbidity and mortality, and use of blood transfusion on 30-day morbidity and mortality.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among 522 patients in the study, 40 (8%) patients required a blood transfusion. 172 (33%) underwent major hepatectomy. Indications for surgery included metastatic neoplasm (n=229, 44%), primary hepatic neoplasm (n=108, 21%), primary extra-hepatic biliary neoplasm (n=23, 4%), and non-malignant indications (n=162, 31%). 86 (16%) patients had a postoperative morbidity; 8 (2%) patients died. After adjustment for significant effect of NSQIP estimated probability of morbidity (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.08-1.66, p=0.009), blood transfusion was significantly associated with postoperative morbidity (OR 4.00, 95% CI 1.99-8.04, p&lt;0.0001).

A decision analytic model was constructed to detail the impact of POPF risk, perioperative mortality, complication rates, and readmission rates on hospital costs, payments, and net profits. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand how alterations in clinical variables affected fiscal outcomes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Clinically significant POPF (ISGPF B/C) rates for negligible (0), low (1-2), moderate (3-6) and high-risk (7-10)  FRS subsets were 0% (n= 164), 5.2% (n= 343), 16.3%% (n= 603), and 28.9% (n=83), respectively. Per-patient hospital cost for negligible-risk patients was $37,855. Low-, moderate-, and high-risk patients had incrementally higher hospital costs of $38,125 (0.7% above negligible-risk), $41,128 (+8.6%), and $41,983 (+10.9%), respectively. Similarly, hospital payment for negligible-risk patients was $42,685/patient, with incrementally higher payments for low-risk ($43,265; +1.4%), moderate-risk ($45,439; +6.5%) and high-risk ($46,564; +9.1%) patients. Net profit (payment minus cost), however, was similar across incremental risk groups: $4,380, $5,140, $4,311 and $4,581, respectively.

Patients with unspecified number of lymph nodes examined were excluded. Cochran-Armitage trend analyses were performed to test for linear trends in binomial proportions of node examination and N classification over time. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the impact of lymph node status on overall survival for patients diagnosed over 2-year intervals from 1998-2011.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: For PDs in which at least one node was surgically examined, the median number of examined lymph nodes nearly doubled from 8 (IQR 5-13) in 1998 to 16 (IQR 11-23) in 2012. The rate of N1 disease increased from 61.3% to 66.4% (p&lt;0.0001). (Figure) Over all years, median LNR remained between 0.10-0.13. 7.3% of resected patients in 1998 had no lymph nodes examined compared to only 2.4% in 2012 (p&lt;0.0001). Median survival was significantly different between N1 and N0 patients (all p&lt;0.0001) at all time intervals, and survival in both subgroups improved. In successive multivariate models adjusted for gender, race, T stage, margin status, and tumor grade, N0 vs. N1 status was consistently protective for overall survival (p&lt;0.0001), but there was no change in the magnitude of its hazard ratio over time (overall HR 0.718; 95% CI 0.696-0.741). Likewise, lymph node status continued to be a significant predictor of overall survival when models were stratified by receipt of chemoradiotherapy vs. chemotherapy only vs. neither (HR 0.690; CI 0.669-0.713) and when stratified by age group (HR 0.709; CI 0.687-0.732). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In contrast to previous years, contemporary patients have an adequate number of nodes examined during standard PD. This, along with with rising rates of N1 cancer detection, suggests more accurate classification of lymph node status and prognosis after resection. However, the strength of lymph node status as a prognosticator for overall survival has not changed. More research is needed regarding the repercussions of increased lymph node dissection and the optimal standards for nodal harvest and evaluation in the modern era.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Hanna<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Maryland,School Of Medicine,Baltimore, MD, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Esophageal cancer represents a growing public health burden in the United States, with 5 year survival rates at 20 to 30%. Surgery is the mainstay of localized esophageal cancer and minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) presents as an alternative approach to open esophagectomy (OE). While no randomized control trial has clarified its utility, MIE has been shown in small series to be better in hospital stay parameters, and equivalent in postoperative morbidity and mortality as well as survival. The generalizability from these studies, however, is not clear as treatment selection bias becomes a significant problem in applying their results in clinical practice.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Cancer Database was used to identify stage I-III esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma cancer patients 18 &ndash; 90 years old who underwent either MIE or OE from 2010 to 2012. Several factors were identified that differed between those undergoing MIE vs OE such as insurance type, the rate of receiving chemotherapy and radiation, grade, stage and the type of surgical procedure (total vs partial esophagectomy). Propensity score analysis (PSA) with 1:1 'nearest neighbor' matching based on all demographic and disease factors was therefore used to control for this treatment selection bias. The main outcomes analyzed were 30 day mortality, 30-day unplanned readmissions, 1 year mortality, and overall survival. All statistical analyses used either a logisitic or Cox regression.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of a total of 8659 patients in the database who had surgery in 2010 or later, 1004 MIE and 3026 OE met inclusion criteria. After PSA matching, both groups contained 1004 patients and were balanced in all demographic and disease factors, including the propensity of having a MIE. The number of lymph nodes sampled and rate of negative margins were not statisitically different in both the original matched cohorts. After multivariate analysis, surgery type (MIE vs OE) was not a significant factor in 30-day mortality, 30-day unplanned readmissions, or 1 year mortality in both the unmatched and matched cohorts. While it was also not a significant predictor of overall survival in the unmatched cohort, the use of MIE showed improved overall survival in the matched cohort (HR = 0.85, P &lt; 0.01). Other factors that predicted for improved survival in both the unmatched and matched group include treatment at an academic research program, private insurance, a younger patient with less comorbidities, smaller tumors, lower grade and stage of cancer, no lymphovascular invasion, fewer positive lymph nodes, negative margins, and the receipt of neoadjuvant chemoradiation.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  In the surgical management of esophageal cancer in the United States, a minimally invasive approach confers neither a benefit nor a risk compared to an open approach in short term outcomes and may actually provide a small but not insignificant survival benefit long term.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Bevacizumab, an antibody against VEGFA (a well known mediator of angiogenesis) is used for the treatment of colorectal cancer, mostly in the advanced and recurrent setting. To date, there is no objective data that demonstrate a relationship between angiogenetic factors and survival. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we sought to determine if the level of expression of angiogenesis-related genes in colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) tumors is associated with survival.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All available clinical and RNA-seq data from COAD samples were obtained from the TCGA database. RNA-seqV2 data for VEGFA, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 (markers of angiogenesis) and CD31 (marker for vascular endothelial cells) was normalized for analysis using R; Gene-expression was compared between normal and tumor samples for our genes of interest. A cutoff was identified for each gene of interest to categorize each sample as either low or high. All the available clinical data in the database was analyzed by hand to maximize the number of patients with disease free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) data points. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to plot DFS and OS and statistical significance was calculated. Only the gene-expression in the tumor was used for survival analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 314 COAD samples with RNA-seq data; 41 corresponded to normal tissue and 273 to tumor samples. Of the 273 patients with tumor RNA-seq, 240 patients also had usable OS data available and 233 had usable DFS data available. There was a significant difference in expression of VEGFA (p=1.352e-04), VEGFR1 (p=7.613e-04) and CD31 (4.713e-09) between colon cancer and normal colon. VEGFA and VEGFR1 were highly expressed in tumors versus normal tissue, implying higher angiogenesis, while CD31 was higher in normal tissue. These expression differences are in agreement with the notion that normal colon mucosa is more vascular than the tumor, and tumors have higher angiogenetic activity. When comparing tumors based on their gene expression we found that there was worse DFS in patients with tumors that express higher levels of VEGFA (p=0.00498), VEGFR1 (p=0.002), VEGFR2 (p=0.03411), and CD31 (p=0.03619). Also, there was worse OS for patients with higher expression of VEGFA (p=0.00502). Our results are in agreement with the notion that tumors that express high levels of pro-angiogenic factors and receptors, as well as generation of vessels are associated with poor survival.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Tumors with increased angiogenesis, represented by high expression of VEGFA and VEGF receptors, have worse disease-free and overall survival. This is in agreement with the improved survival that was been seen in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer when treated with Bevacizumab.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Previous analyses have been limited by small sample size and have failed to demonstrate a survival advantage. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Resected AJCC pathologic stage I-III small bowel adenocarcinoma patients receiving AC (n=1,637) or surgery alone (SA) (n=2,753) were identified in the National Cancer Data Base (1998&ndash;2011). Cox regression identified covariates associated with overall survival (OS). AC and SA cohorts were matched (1:1) by propensity scores based on the likelihood of receiving AC on multivariable analysis or hazard ratio on Cox modeling. Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS were compared. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Omission of adjuvant chemotherapy conferred an increased risk of death (HR 1.36 95% CI 1.22&ndash;1.52, p&lt;0.001). After propensity-score matching, median OS was superior in patients with AJCC stage III disease receiving AC compared with SA (n=1,217, 41.4 vs. 26.5 m, p&lt;0.001), regardless of tumor location (duodenum: n=545, 36.3 vs. 25.7 m, p=0.002; jejunoileal: n=469, 47.9 vs. 30.0 m, p=0.015).

Most PCCs secrete both epinephrine and norepinephrine, while PGs secrete only norepinephrine. Our hypothesis is that PCCs and PGs unique catecholamine secreting profiles alters perioperative hemodynamics and management.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective analysis was performed of PCC and PG patients undergoing surgical treatment at the University of Michigan from 2006-2015. Non-secreting and extra-abdominal PG and PCC were excluded. Demographics, vital signs, lab data, pre-operative &alpha;-blocking, &beta;-blocking or Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channel blocking medication use, operative hemodynamic data, perioperative use and dose of vasoactive medications, and post-operative hemodynamic data were compared between PCC and PG.  Statistical significance was determined with Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney-U tests for continuous variables. p values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 62 PCC and 15 PG patients were compared; there was no significant difference in gender or age between groups. PGs had elevated normetanephrine but normal metanephrine levels. Laparoscopic resection was completed in 20.0% of PG of cases and 67.8% of PCC (p=0.0011). The median operative time for PG was 238min but only 153min for PCC (p=0.0027). Estimated blood loss in PG was 900mL vs 75mL in PCC (p=0.0013). Median fluid administration was 5744mL for PG and 4210 for PCC (p=0.0228). PCC patients had greater median minimum diastolic BP at 81mmHg vs 74mmHg in PG (p=0.0175). PCC patients had greater maximum diastolic BP, 88.5mmHg vs 82mmHg (p=0.0043). The median final dose of preoperative phenoxybenzamine for PG was 85mg/day and only 60mg/day for PCC (p=0.1965).  60% of PG and 66.1% of PCC patients used &beta;-blockers (p=0.7649), and 20.0% of PG patients and 35.5% of PCC patients were placed on preoperative Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers (p=0.3605). No significant differences in the use of vasoactive medications were found with 46.7% of PG and 48.4% of PCC receiving MgSO<sub>4</sub> (p=1.000), 40.0% of PG and 59.7% of PCC having &beta;-blockers (p=0.2468) and 80.0% of PG and 75.8% of PCC receiving other vasoactive medications (p=1.000). A significantly higher percentage of PG patients, however, experienced all types of post-operative hemodynamic instability (HDI) events, with 46.7% of PG but only 12.9% of PCC patients experiencing HDI (p=0.0072, see Fig. 1).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite differing biochemical profiles, PCC and PG have similar preoperative blood pressure blockade requirements and respond to the medications similarly.

BRAF mutational status has been inconsistently correlated with recurrence. Furthermore, with the impetus to observe low risk tumors without resection, accurate risk stratification is paramount.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An unselected historical cohort of patients (from 2000 &ndash; 2007) who underwent at least total thyroidectomy for PTC was analyzed to model recurrence by BRAF mutational status. BRAF status was determined by DNA extraction and PCR-based single nucleotide extension genotyping of paraffin embedded primary tumor specimens. Univariate analysis was performed with Wilcoxon rank sum and log rank test. A multivariable cox proportional hazards model was used to determine clinicopathologic factors associated with time to recurrence (primary outcome) and second recurrence (secondary outcome). Recurrence was defined as pathologically confirmed PTC or distant metastases treated with radioactive iodine (RAI) greater than 90 days from index operation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The recurrence incidence within our 605 patient cohort was 77 (12.7%). Of these, BRAF mutational status was determined for 402 (66.4%) with 254 (63.2%) containing BRAFV600E. The median overall follow up was 8.3 years (IQR 6.6 &ndash; 10.3) with 7.7 years (6.0 &ndash; 9.3) for BRAFV600E and 8.6 years (IQR 7.0 &ndash; 11.0) for wild type.There were no differences in clinicopathological risk factors between patients with and without BRAF testing. The incidence of recurrence among BRAFV600E patients was 38 (17.6%) compared to 11 (8.0%) among BRAF wild type (p = 0.02). Of the initial and repeat recurrences, 76 (98.7%) and 16 (80%) were locoregional, respectively. In the multivariable cox regression analysis controlling for clinicopathologic risk factors (Figure 1), the likelihood of PTC recurrence was increased by BRAF mutation status (hazard ratio 2.4, p = 0.03), tumor size by AJCC T stage (HR 1.9, p = 0.01), and regional lymph node metastases at index operation (HR 1.9, p =0.01). The median time to recurrence overall was 1.9 years (IQR 0.68 &ndash; 4.1), 2.1 years (IQR 1.1 &ndash; 4.3) for BRAFV600E and 2.8 years (IQR 0.6 &ndash; 5.3) for wild type. Twenty patients developed a second recurrence; in this subset of patients the incidence of BRAFV600E was also significantly correlated with time to recurrence (p = 0.04).  Eleven (1.8%) patients died, with four (0.7%) deaths attributable to PTC.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Adjusting for known clinicopathologic risk factors for PTC recurrence, BRAF V600E mutation remains predictive over a long follow up.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Sabel<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Michigan,Surgery,Ann Arbor, MI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The metric of success for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in breast cancer has traditionally been a complete pathologic response (pCR). Consequently, NACT is considered less often in luminal A patients, where a pCR is unlikely. However, a pCR is not always necessary to allow avoidance of mastectomy. We sought to examine the impact of NACT on BCT eligibility based on histologic subtype, particularly among patients with the luminal A subtype.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Our IRB-approved prospective breast cancer database was queried for patients who underwent NACT prior to curative surgery.  Charts were reviewed for clinicopathologic features, pathologic response, surgical therapy and BCT eligibility before and after NACT as determined by the surgeon.  Patients with inflammatory breast cancer or eligible for BCT prior to NACT were excluded when calculating the conversion rate.  Patients were categorized by molecular subtype based on estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her-2/neu overexpression:  luminal A (ER or PR positive, Her-2/neu negative), luminal B (ER or PR positive, Her-2/neu positive), HER2- enriched (ER/PR negative, Her-2/neu positive), or basal &ndash;like (triple negative).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 417 patients identified, 139 (33%) were luminal A, 76 (18%) were luminal B, 69 (17%) were HER2-enriched and 133 (%) were triple negative. Rates of pCR were highest (55%) among HER2-enriched patient and were extremely low (6%) among luminal-A patients.  The breast conservation rate was relatively similar across subtypes, ranging from 29% to 39%.  However, the BCT rate was influenced by NACT use among initially BCT-eligible patients, and by BCT-eligible patients after NACT opting for bilateral mastectomy.  Among non-inflammatory patients determined to be ineligible for BCT prior to NACT, conversion to BCT-eligibility (regardless of subsequent surgery) was highest (nearly 2/3<sup>rd</sup>) for HER2-enriched and triple-negative patients. While the BCT conversion rate was lower for hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative patients (41%), there was still a substantial impact on surgical outcomes.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: For NACT, pCR rates or BCT rates present an incomplete assessment of this therapy by overlooking the impact on surgical decision making. A substantial percentage of luminal A patients can avoid mastectomy with NACT, despite a significantly lower pCR rate.  Measuring BCT rates after NACT does not adequately measure the impact of NACT on BCT eligibility, as NACT may be used in BCT-eligible patients, and after NACT, BCT-eligible patients may opt for unilateral or bilateral mastectomies.  Surgical response rate, or conversion to BCT eligibility, as assessed by the surgeon, should be measured prospectively in future trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

While many surgeons had used intraoperative evaluation (IOE) either with frozen section (FS) or touch imprint cytology (TIC) to dictate whether to complete an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in the same operative setting, the widespread acceptance of the ACOSOG Z-0011 trial has lessened the need to do so in patients with 1-2 positive nodes undergoing a lumpectomy.  We sought to determine, in a contemporary context, what surgeons' practices were vis-&agrave;-vis the use of IOE, and factors affecting the same.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   An online survey of surgeons was performed using the American College of Surgeons Communities' Platform. Surgeons were asked about their clinical setting as well as their current use of IOE for SLNB. Nonparametric statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 21.0. In order to control for multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni correction was applied to the threshold for statistical significance, resulting in a significant p-value &lt; 0.006 (0.05/9).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  270 surgeons responded to the survey. To the question &quot;In patients undergoing SLNB, do you get IOE?&quot;, 71 (27.1%) stated that they did IOE on all patients, 104 (39.7%) stated that they did so only on mastectomy patients, and 87 (33.2%) reported that they did not use IOE at all. Factors correlated with the use of IOE included geographic location (urban/suburban/rural), and proportion of practice that was breast-related (p&lt;0.001 for both).  In addition, surgeons who felt that isolated tumor cells did not constitute a positive lymph node and those who felt that the risk of lymphedema after ALND was &gt; 10% were more likely to use IOE selectively in mastectomy patients (p=0.003 and p=0.005, respectively).  Surgeon age, duration in practice, practice type (academic/hospital employed/private practice), and perception of the risk of lymphedema after SLNB did not influence surgeons' use of IOE.  Furthermore, whether surgeons used FS or TIC for IOE did not affect whether they utilized IOE always or selectively.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  While nearly 70% of surgeons use IOE, the majority do so selectively in mastectomy patients only. Surgeons with solely breast-related practices in urban areas were more likely to use IOE only on mastectomy patients; those who felt that a positive SLN was defined as tumor deposits &gt; 0.2 mm and who felt the risk of lymphedema was &gt; 10% after ALND were also more likely to do so.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Matching was successful for mostly clean wound class patients (34/40 in the BioM group; 35/40 SynM) and a few with concomitant procedures (2/40 in the BioM; 3/40 SynM). In these low risk patients, wound occurrences were similar (BioM, 15%; SynM, 10%) as were readmissions (BioM 33%; SynM 23%), but 180-day costs remained higher ($31,844 vs. $15,527).

Cirrhosis has consistently been shown to be a predictor of worse perioperative outcomes, but the magnitude of that risk is poorly understood as the current literature on these patients is predominantly small retrospective series. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) has been validated as a predictor of perioperative outcomes. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) provides a unique opportunity to study a large population of patients with high MELD scores for many commonly performed operations to better quantify the perioperative risks of these patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The ACS-NSQIP database from 2005-2013 was used to study patients undergoing cholecystectomy.  All patients with CPT codes identifying cholecystectomy were included, and the cohort was divided into laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy. Patients without all laboratory values needed to calculate the MELD were excluded. ICD-9 diagnoses related to choledocholithiasis and preoperative dialysis patients were excluded given the potential for confounding elevation of the MELD score. Bivariate data analysis was performed and logistic regression modeling was conducted to calculate risk-adjusted 30-day outcomes. Logistic regression modeling was performed with 26 preoperative validated variables included in ACS-NSQIP. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 63,464 patients were included in the study. Unadjusted mortality steadily increased as the MELD score increased in the laparoscopic (MELD=6-10, 0.2%; 11-15, 1.1%; 16-20, 3.2%; &gt;20, 5.8%) and open groups (MELD=6-10, 1.5%; 11-15, 3.7%; 16-20, 8.6%; &gt;20, 17.9%; P&lt;0.0001). Unadjusted morbidity similarly increased with MELD score increases in the laparoscopic (MELD=6-10, 3.8%; 11-15, 9.9%; 16-20, 16.3%; &gt;20, 22.8%) and open groups (MELD=6-10, 18.7%; 11-15, 28.2%; 16-20, 40.7%; &gt;20, 57.8%; P&lt;0.0001).

A cumulative incidence curve was used to describe timing of stricture diagnosis. The use of imaging and intervention were evaluated. In the cumulative incidence curve, patients were censored when they died (no longer at risk for stricture) or were lost to follow-up (no further Medicare claims). A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to identify factors associated with stricture diagnosis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 3,374 patients underwent an operation requiring a hepaticojejunostomy. The 2- and 5-year survival for the cohort was 57% and 43%. The mean age at the time of surgery was 75.3&plusmn;6.2 years. 1,729 (51.2%) patients had a malignant diagnosis. Overall, 403 patients developed a stricture after surgery. Taking into account death and loss to follow-up, the cumulative incidence of stricture was 12.5% at 2 years and 17.4% at 5 years. Mean time to stricture formation was 16.8&plusmn;21.6 months (median=8.5 months). 51.9% (N=209) of patients who developed a stricture had a percutaneous transhepatic catheter (PTC) placed. Of the 403 patients with a stricture diagnosis, 233 (57.8%) were for complications related to stricture. The most common reason for stricture-related admission was cholangitis (N=94). Only 18 of the 403 patients (4.5%) required definitive reoperation. Based on a Cox proportional hazards model, only the presence of a preoperative endostent (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.35, 2.07) predicted stricture formation; preoperative PTC (HR 1.29; 95% CI 0.70, 2.37) did not. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In patients who survive, strictures occur with high frequency after an operation requiring hepaticojejunostomy and should be followed with serial liver function tests. Preoperative stent placement is associated with future stricture formation in patients who undergo hepaticojejunostomy. Even though the majority can be managed non-operatively, stricture diagnosis remains burdensome requiring frequent rehospitalizations, follow-up, and procedures.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

However, many of these comparisons include RDP cohorts comprised of smaller subset of surgeons that adopt the robotic platform or 2 attending surgeon teams versus LDP cohorts from larger groups of institutional surgeons across several disciplines. We hypothesize that this difference in surgical teams is a primary contributing factor to the superior outcomes of RDP.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a retrospective analysis of all minimally invasive spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomies from 2008 to 2015. All cases were performed with the intent to preserve the spleen. Operative characteristics, perioperative outcomes, and 90-day morbidity were compared between LDP and RDP. Subgroup analysis of institutional LDP versus RDP and single-surgeon LDP versus RDP was also performed to control for surgeon variability.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  A total of 95 patients underwent minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy with intent to preserve the spleen: 71 (74.7%) LDP and 24 (25.3%) RDP. Conversion rates to open distal pancreatectomy were equivalent (1 RDP and 3 LDP; both 4.2%). Rates of any complication were higher in the LDP group (42.2% vs. 17.4; p=0.046) but specific complications including pancreatic leak, postoperative bleeding, wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess, and splenic infarction were similar between the groups. Although operative time was higher in patients who underwent RDP (mean 287.1 vs. 217.1 min; p=0.001), hospital length of stay was significantly shorter in the RDP group (mean 2.4 vs. 3.6 days; p&lt; 0.001). RDP was associated with more than two-thirds odds reduction in postoperative complications (OR 0.30 95% CI 0.092-0.980; p=0.046). However, subgroup analysis demonstrated that differences between LDP and RDP diminish upon evaluation of single-surgeon outcomes (Table). The previous RDP risk reduction of postoperative complications was not significant in subgroup analysis of a single surgeon who is facile in both RDP and LDP (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.959-1.041; p=0.98).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: RDP is an acceptable minimally invasive approach with postoperative outcomes equivalent to that of LDP in carefully selected patients. Although RDP may offer the benefits of improved range of motion and dexterity over LDP, the novel robotic approach is not necessarily better than LDP as often claimed in institutional comparisons. Robotic technology should be viewed as another tool to facilitate the transition from open surgery rather than a replacement of laparoscopic technique.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Soft (normal) pancreas texture is a well-established risk factor for PF. Recently, studies have suggested that post-PD serum hyperamylasemia (PPHA) may also be a risk factor. In this study, we evaluate the relationship of pancreas texture and post-operative serum amylase levels in determining PF risk in patients who have undergone PD.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This retrospective cohort study utilizing the pancreatic surgery database at Thomas Jefferson University evaluated all patients who underwent PD from 2009 to 2014. The highest postoperative serum amylase level from postoperative day (POD) 0 to POD 5 was obtained. An ROC curve analysis obtained a threshold value to define PPHA compared to  normal serum amylase levels. Chi-square analyses and odds ratios evaluated the relationship between pancreas texture, serum amylase level, and the development of PF.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Data from 525 consecutive patients were analyzed after excluding 80 due to a lack of information on pancreas texture. Serum amylase levels on POD2-POD5 were not found to be predictive of PF occurrence; thus, the remaining analysis focused on the highest amylase value between POD0 and POD1. The serum amylase threshold value of 165 IU/I yielded greatest accuracy from the ROC curve analysis (AUC: 0.75; Sensitivity: 0.70; Specificity: 0.72). Demographics and clinical information were similar between patients with PPHA and those with normal serum amylase. Soft pancreata were more likely to have PPHA (p &lt; 0.001) and PF (p &lt; 0.001) than hard pancreata.  PPHA was associated with increased rates of PF (p &lt; 0.001), intra-abdominal abscess (p &lt; 0.001), delayed gastric emptying (p = 0.04), wound infection (p &lt; 0.001), hepaticojejunostomy or duodenojejunostomy leakage (p = 0.03), cardiac complications (p = 0.02), pulmonary complications (p &lt; 0.001), as well as increased length of stay (p &lt; 0.001). Fifty-nine patients with soft pancreata developed PF, with 49 (83%) having PPHA.  Overall, patients with a soft pancreas and PPHA had the highest PF rate (34.5%), and those with a hard pancreas and normal serum amylase had the lowest rate (5.9%)(Odds ratio: 8.35; 95% CI: 4.4-15.9). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Accurate estimation of PF risk is achievable by incorporation of pancreas texture and immediate post-operative serum amylase levels. Analysis of their interplay segregates patients into well-defined risk groups. The presence of PPHA on POD0 or POD1 increases PF risk, even more so than soft pancreatic texture alone. The minimal PF rate in patients with hard pancreata and normal POD 0-1 serum amylase levels identifies a cohort unlikely to develop PF.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

The purpose of this study was to determine the presentation, oncologic profile, and survival of this patient population utilizing a large national database.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Cancer Data Base (1998-2012) was queried for all adult patients with a diagnosis of a solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. Patient demographic, clinical, and pathologic characteristics at the time of diagnosis were determined. A binary logistic regression model was utilized to identify variables associated with resection. A Cox proportional hazards model was developed to identify factors associated with survival.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 390 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age at diagnosis was 40 years with the majority of tumors occurring in females (83.3%) and those of white race (68.8%). The mean tumor size was 6.7 cm and the majority of patients underwent surgical resection (87.4%). Of the 341 patients undergoing surgical resection, 2.9% underwent local excision, 11.1% underwent total pancreatectomy, 33.5% underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, and 52.5% underwent partial pancreatectomy. Of the patients undergoing surgical resection, 8.5% had positive lymph nodes and 8.7% had positive margins. Five year survival was 49.7% for those who did not undergo resection compared to 95.0% for those who did undergo resection (p &lt; 0.01). After adjustment, decreasing patient age (OR = 1.37, p &lt; 0.01), decreasing tumor size (OR = 1.02, p &lt; 0.01), and tumors located in the body or tail of the pancreas (OR = 2.38, p = 0.02) predicted resection. For patients undergoing resection, increasing patient age (HR = 1.49, p = 0.04) and treatment at a non-academic facility (HR = 3.23, p = 0.03) were associated with compromised survival after adjustment.

Stress may negatively affect surgeons' performance in the operating room, jeopardizing patient safety. Studies reporting on stress in surgeons focused on perceived stress during operations. For measuring objective stress, complex methods (saliva cortisol level) are used that cannot record stress real time and for a longer period. Long lasting stress patterns during the day and outside the operating room, and the effect of demographics and surgical factors (e.g. experience) on stress are of interest to identify areas and individuals for stress modulation. This pilot study aimed at continuously measuring mental stress during common daily activities in surgeons and residents using a novel, easy to wear sensor.   <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Surgeons and residents wore the HealthPatch&trade; (Vital Connect) continuously for 2 to 3 days including operations, outpatient clinics, ward visits, and other tasks such as administrative work. The wireless patch, that is attached to the chest skin without wires, is able to measure heart rate variability (HRV), and stress level in percentage using an algorithm of heart rate (HR) and HRV. The standard deviation of the interval between two heart beats (SDNN) and the ratio between low frequency and high frequency (LF/HF ratio) represented HRV and were automatically calculated by the patch. The patch stops measuring stress percentage during increased physical activity. Data was transmitted to the cloud by a smart phone and were downloaded for analysis. Subjective stress was measured before and after each operation using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; ?STAI &ge;1 point indicates increased stress).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Significant differences in SDNN, LF/HF ratio, and stress percentages were found in both surgeons and residents during operative procedures in comparison with baseline (p=.000; p=.01; p=.000). SDNN and stress percentage differed significantly between operations and outpatient clinic (p=.000 and p=.001), other work (p=.000 and p=.000), and ward visits (p=.006 and p=.000). Fellows and senior residents had higher stress percentages than senior surgeons during operations (p=.024 and p=.021). SDNN, LF/HF ratio, and stress percentage did not differ between surgical procedures indicated as stressful (?STAI&ge;1) or not stressful (?STAI&lt;1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Continuous stress monitoring in surgeons and resident surgeons using a wearable sensor patch reveals relevant data on mental stress of surgeons and residents during the day. Performing an operation is mentally more stressful than other daily activities, particularly for residents and fellows. In future studies, the smart patch could be used for assessing the effect of stress on skills and during training programs.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Sixty-three scans were initially negative (44%), of which 23 were DS (37%) and 40 were ISS (63%).  Of repeated scans, seven were DS (11%) and 56 were ISS (89%).  Twenty-two patients had scans that converted to positive (35%), five with subsequent DS (8%) and 17 with subsequent ISS (27%).  Initial negative DS were more likely to convert to positive with subsequent scan compared to initial negative ISS (p=0.03).  Of patient groups, scans of patients with normocalcemic or normohormal PHPT were less likely to convert to positive than scans of patients with classic PHPT (p=0.003).  Scans of asymptomatic patients demonstrated the highest rate of conversion to positive (73%, n =16), of which 80% were initial DS followed by subsequent ISS.  In multivariate analysis, increase in serum calcium (p=0.009) predicted conversion from a negative to a subsequent positive scan.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Repeating the sestamibi scan was helpful in 35% of patients, especially when the initial exam was a delayed scan and the subsequent exam was an iodine-subtraction scan.

It is traditionally diagnosed with a combination of physical examination and plain radiographs of the abdomen. The diagnostic role for ultrasound in NEC is uncertain. We hypothesized that ultrasound (US) is as sensitive as plain radiographs in the diagnosis and management of NEC.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The medical records of all infants with NEC in a single pediatric tertiary center from January 2006- January 2013 were reviewed. In order to factor in NEC's rapid rate of changes in pathologic findings, patients that underwent US within four hours of abdominal XR were included in the analysis. Bell's Criteria were utilized to stage each patient during his/her course. Clinical, radiologic, surgical and pathological findings were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed using Student&#39;s t-test and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and Fisher&#39;s exact for categorical variables.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:During this period, 186 neonates were diagnosed with NEC, of which 26 met inclusion criteria. It was noted that US was done for confirmatory purposes in these 26 patients after plain radiographs did not agree with clinical findings.  Plain radiographs and ultrasound were taken within an average of 2.46 &plusmn; 1.17 hrs of each other. At the time of XR and US, the Bell's staging of the patients was Stage 1 in 27% of the cases (n=7), Stage 2 in 42% (n=11), and Stage 3 in 31% (n=8). There were 92% preterm infants, 38.5% had congenital anomalies (i.e. omphalocele, congenital neck mass, and Congenital High Airway Obstruction Syndrome), 19% had cardiac abnormalities, and 23% had patent ductus arteriosus. The survival rate of our NEC population was 65% (n=17).  Surgical intervention was undergone in 65% (n=17) of our patients in which the median time between imaging findings and time of surgery was 2 (0-59) days. When comparing both modality for reliability in detecting intestinal ischemia and/or perforation with surgical findings, US had a sensitivity of 72% with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 93% while plain radiographs had a sensitivity of 42% with a PPV of 100%.  In all cases that required surgical drainage (n=4), ultrasound findings of complex fluid collections guided the decision for bedside surgical drainage where plain radiograph did not suggest free fluid.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In this study, ultrasound proved to be helpful in assessing the need for surgical interventions in neonates where diagnosis of advanced NEC is ambiguous. US appeared to be more sensitive in reliably detecting intestinal perforation/ischemia in comparison to plain radiographs.  However, both plain radiographs and ultrasound play a key role in the diagnosis and should be considered conjunctively during the management and treatment of NEC.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Current Western Trauma Association guidelines recommend that all adults with the presence of a blunt splenic injury and contrast blush should be considered for angioembolization.  Currently, rate of splenectomy and failure of NOM of blunt organ injury is used as a quality indicator to assess trauma centers caring for injured children.  We hypothesized that children with a CB represent a higher risk group and the use of splenectomy rate alone may not be an accurate measure of quality.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review of all children admitted to either of two academic pediatric trauma centers following blunt trauma with any grade liver or spleen injury from 1/09-12/13.  Data evaluated included presence of CB on initial CT, need for intervention, and timing of intervention. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:245 children were admitted with blunt liver or spleen injury.  45 children were excluded due to lack of radiology report. 183 children had no CB (91%); 17 children had either a definite CB or CB could not be ruled out (9%) and were included in the CB group. Of those with CB, 3 required splenectomy (18%); all three were taken directly from the ED to the OR due to hemodynamic instability that failed to respond to packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion.  Three additional children in the CB group received a PRBC transfusion within 12 hours of injury.  One child had an avulsed kidney and underwent laparotomy, one child received PRBC transfusion during an orthopedic procedure, and the last child was hypotensive and thus received a transfusion.  Each of the remaining 11 children with CB remained hemodynamically stable throughout their hospital stay; none required intervention in the form of laparotomy, angioembolization (AE), or PRBC transfusion.  No children in either group underwent AE. Children with a CB were more likely to require splenectomy than children with no CB (n=3 (18%) vs n=1 (1%); p&lt;0.01).  CB was associated with a higher injury grade than lack of CB (3.4 vs 2.7; p &lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Contrast blush is rare among children with blunt solid organ injury, but does identify a higher risk group.  The presence of CB alone did not precipitate splenectomy, however children with CB were more likely to be hemodynamically unstable, requiring intervention. If splenectomy rates are to be utilized as a quality measure for pediatric trauma care, the presence of vascular blush should also be considered as it represents a 5x higher risk of need for emergent intervention.  The need for splenectomy can be used as a quality indicator, however this should not include children with a vascular blush.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Patients with chronic medical conditions, including Peutz-Jegher Disease and Henoch-Schonlien Purpura, were excluded. Individual patients were followed across admissions for 6-months from initial presentation or until bowel resection occurred. Successful FER was defined as having had radiologic reduction without subsequent surgery for 6 months.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 7412 patients were identified. 6681 were &le;3 years. Of these, 175 (2.6%) underwent primary surgery, 1114 (16.7%) had surgery at some point after FER, and 5392 (80.7%) were successfully treated with FER. 731 patients were &gt; 3 years: 176 (24.1%) underwent primary surgery, 105 (14.4%) had surgery after FER, and 450 (61.6%) were successfully treated with FER. In patients &gt;3 years, length of stay (LOS) between patients who underwent primary surgery versus those who underwent surgery after FER at their initial visit was similar (Median 4 days vs 4 days, p = 0.06); those undergoing successful FER had a median LOS of 1 day (p &lt;0.0001). The frequency of patients with a concurrent discharge diagnosis within a tumor category were similar in patients &le;3 years and patients &gt;3 years (4.8% vs 6.3%, p = 0.07). The frequency of Meckel's diverticulum was 2.3% in those &le;3 years and 13.5% in those &gt;3 years (p &lt;0.0001). There were only 3 patients who died; all were &le;3 years. In those failing FER and undergoing surgery, there was no difference in LOS between those &le;3 and &gt;3 years (Median 3 vs 4 days, p = 0.09); &lt;1% of older children were admitted to the intensive care unit as compared to 9.8% in those &le;3 years (p &lt;0.01). Older age was not associated with increased risk of recurrent admission for intussusception (p = 0.58).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although older children with intussusception were more likely to undergo operative intervention than younger children, PHIS data analysis suggests that fluoroscopy may be a safe initial procedure for a majority of older children. A prospective observational trial would be necessary to confirm this finding, which could help inform future treatment algorithm for older pediatric patients presenting with intussusception.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Government and private entities have strongly encouraged use of real-time ultrasound (RTUS) for CVC placement in adults and children. These recommendations are based almost exclusively on studies involving adult patients treated by non-surgeons. This lack of evidence involving surgically placed catheters makes such recommendations less generalizable to pediatric surgeons who, based on a recent APSA survey, preferentially access the subclavian vein (SCV). Our primary aim was to determine frequency of RTUS use by pediatric surgeons during CVC placement in the operating room. Secondary aims included determining factors associated with RTUS use and evaluating adverse event rates when compared to landmark (LM) technique.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective cohort study was performed for patients aged &lt;18 years who underwent CVC placement in the operating room between 07/01/2013 and 06/30/2014 at 14 institutions. Patient demographics and operative details were collected. Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests were performed to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. A logistic regression model evaluated factors associated with RTUS use. P-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 1,146 patients included, with RTUS used in 33% of attempts. The SCV (64%) was preferentially chosen over the internal jugular vein (IJV) (34%) for 1<sup>st</sup> site insertion. RTUS was less likely to be used for SCV compared to IJV (OR=0.002; p&lt;0.0001) and more likely to be used when coagulopathy (INR&gt;1.5) was present (OR=11.1; p=0.03). No associations for RTUS use were found for age, BMI, previous line history, or trainee involvement. Mechanical complication rate (pneumothorax, hemothorax, arterial puncture) was 3.2% and overall complication rate including central line-associated bloodstream infections was 9.1%. RTUS use was associated with a higher procedure success rates on 1<sup>st</sup> site attempt but higher risk of hemothorax compared to LM (Table). Median operative time was similar (42 vs 43 minutes; p=0.35).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Pediatric surgeons preferentially choose the SCV for 1<sup>st</sup> site insertion, yet are more likely to use RTUS when placing a CVC in the IJV. RTUS was superior to LM for 1<sup>st</sup> site procedure success, yet was associated with a higher hemothorax rate. Adoption of RTUS guidelines in children would require significant practice change with unclear safety benefits. The retrospective nature of this study precludes evaluation of the quality of RTUS implementation. Prospective trials involving children treated by pediatric surgeons are needed to generate more definitive data relevant to the field of pediatric surgery.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Cowles<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Yale University School Of Medicine,Pediatric Surgery,New Haven, CT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Small intestinal length has functional and prognostic significance for patients with short bowel syndrome and accurate measurement of Roux-en-Y limbs is considered important. Factors such as the flexibility and elasticity of the bowel make its measurement highly subjective, but despite this, a recommended method for intestinal measurement allowing accurate comparisons between surgeons and institutions has not been defined. Operative measurement of intestinal length with silk suture, umbilical tape, straight ruler, and laparoscopic graspers has been described in a variety of surgical settings, but no comparison of the fidelity of measurement by each technique has been made. We hypothesized that techniques using silk suture and umbilical tape would yield the most consistent measurements.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This IRB-approved prospective trial enrolled 12 volunteer surgeons. Participants were asked to measure short, medium, and long segments of small intestine in a euthanized rabbit using common operating room tools (silk suture, umbilical tape, a 15 cm straight ruler, and laparoscopic Dorsey bowel graspers). Data were analyzed by ANOVA repeated measures model.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over short segments (grand mean M=20.88+/-SEM1.83cm), intestinal measurements by grasper (18.58+/-1.96cm) were significantly shorter than those by tape (23.52+/-2.23cm, p=0.002) or ruler (20.95+/-1.83cm, p=0.039), and not significantly different than measurement by suture (20.50+/-1.82cm, p=0.105). Over medium length (M=37.33 +/-1.29cm), measurements by grasper (34.63+/-1.87cm) were significantly shorter than those by suture (39.09+/-1.19cm, p=0.032) and tape (39.63+/-1.88cm, p=0.046), and measurements by ruler were also significantly shorter than by suture (35.96+/-1.17cm, p=0.008). Over the long segment (M=104.04+/-3.83cm) no significant differences were found between measurement by suture (103.40+/-5.45cm), tape (109.85+/-3.79cm), or ruler (98.88+/-8.34cm). There was a significant difference in measurements taken along the mesenteric border compared with those taken along the anti-mesenteric border of the small bowel (85.33+/-6.64cm vs. 122.75+/-3.83cm, p=0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Over short distances, measurement technique appears to matter less. However, along all three lengths measured, shorter more rigid measurement tools, such as laparoscopic graspers and straight rulers, underestimate length and these errors amplify over longer segments. Smaller variances in measurements by silk suture and umbilical tape suggest these methods are more reliable across longer distances. Finally, measurement along the mesenteric border inherently traverses a shorter distance, and may minimize the variation between surgeons, and highlights that this aspect of measurement is particularly important to standardize.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

However, little is known about the natural history of changes in SBD after SBS, and understanding which children develop this type of adaptation and factors associated with it has important implications, as SBD has been identified as a factor in determining eligibility for an intestinal lengthening procedure (ILP). The objective of this study was to evaluate contributory factors for SBD in SBS patients and the effects of SBD on patient outcomes. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective review of SBS patients (defined as dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN) for &gt;60days secondary to loss of intestinal length) born since 2000. We identified 30 children with adequate imaging to assess SBD at more than one time point following bowel resection and prior to any ILP. Demographic and clinical data were collected and SBD was measured on GI contrast studies by a pediatric radiologist. Studies that demonstrated SB obstruction or stricture were excluded, and diameter was measured relative to vertebral size and compared with proximate calibrated films when necessary. SBL was converted to % predicted length based on gestational age (GA). Analysis of factors associated with EA and SBD in the last scan before end of follow-up or EA was conducted using Fisher's Exact Test, Student's t-test, K-M survival analysis, Cox regression, and linear or logistic regression, as appropriate. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:30 children with median GA of 31.5 (IQR 27,35) weeks were followed for 52.6 (28.1,80.4) months. Necrotizing enterocolitis was the most common etiology of SBS (n=13,43%). EA was achieved in 17 (57%), while 11 (37%) remained on PN and 2 (7%) died during follow-up. Median SBD was 23.5mm (IQR 18,42.3), and 9 children demonstrated significant dilation (SBD&gt;40mm,30%). Bivariate analysis identified higher % SBL {OR 1.40)95% CI:1.07,1.83)} and lower SBD {OR 0.87(95% CI:0.80,0.96)} as predictive of achieving EA, and in survival analyses &lt;10% SBL (P=0.024) and higher SBD {HR 0.93(95% CI:0.88,0.98)} predicted increased time to EA. Multivariate linear regression identified lower % SBL {OR -1.02(95% CI:-1.58,-0.45)} and higher birth weight {OR 7.32(95% CI:2.37,12.26)} as strongly predictive of higher SBD. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:SBD is a highly prognostic factor inversely associated with achieving EA in SBS children that can be measured in real-time to track patient progress and inform clinical decision-making.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

The purpose of our analysis was to assess the occurrence of CDI across pediatric thoracic and abdominal surgeries, and characterize its influence on the cost of care. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  There were 320,096 children (age 1-18 years) identified undergoing a thoracic or abdominal surgery from the Kids' Inpatient Database (2003, 2006, 2009, 2012). Patients were stratified based on the development of CDI and compared using univariate statistics. Logistic regression was used to model factors associated with the development of CDI. A propensity score matched analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of CDI on mortality, length of stay (LOS), and costs in similar patient cohorts. Winsorization (1% and 99%) was applied to reduce the influence of extreme outliers. National population weights were used to estimate the excess burden of CDI on these outcomes. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The overall prevalence of CDI in the sampled cohort was 0.31%, with greater rates of CDI present at children's hospitals (CH) (3.9 per 1000) compared to non-children's hospitals (NCH) (2.9 per 1000) (p&lt;0.001). Among both hospital types, there were increasing trends in cases of CDI over time (p&lt;0.001). CDI was associated with younger age and increasing comorbidities (p&lt;0.001). Following propensity score matching, the mean excess LOS and costs attributable to CDI were 7.1 days and $16,021 (p&lt;0.001), respectively, with no significant differences observed for mortality. The estimated annual number of children affected by CDI following surgery was 1,485 (including 11 mortalities), resulting in attributable annual costs of approximately $23.8 million (2012 US$) and 10,544 days spent in the hospital.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: CDI is a relatively uncommon but costly complication in pediatric thoracic and abdominal surgery, and is more prevalent in CH compared to NCH. Given the increasing trend of CDI among hospitalized surgical patients, there is substantial opportunity for reduction of inpatient burden and associated costs in this potentially preventable nosocomial infection.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

These criteria aim to identify injured patients who likely require emergent intervention requiring trauma team presence. We have previously demonstrated that shock index, pediatric age adjusted (SIPA) accurately identifies severely injured children following blunt trauma. We hypothesized that elevated SIPA would more accurately identify injured children requiring highest trauma team activation and emergent intervention than age adjusted hypotension.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review of all children age 4-16 admitted to one of two trauma centers following blunt trauma with an injury severity score &gt;15 from 1/07- 6/13. Indicators of need for trauma team activation included blood transfusion, emergent operation (including craniotomy, intracranial pressure monitor or drain, chest tube, thoracotomy, aniogembolization, or laparotomy), or endotracheal intubation (ETI) within 24 hours of admission.  SIPA represents the maximum normal shock index (SI) for a given age group and was derived based on the maximum normal HR divided by the minimum normal SBP for each age group.  Cutoffs included SI &gt;1.22 (age 4-6), &gt;1.0 (7-12), and &gt;0.9 (13-16). Age adjusted hypotension cutoffs were as follows: SBP &lt;90 (age 4-6), SBP &lt;100 (7-16).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:559 children were included; 21% underwent operation, 37% ETI, and 14% blood transfusion within 24 hours of admission. 56/559 (10%) were hypotensive. 150/559 (27%) had an elevated SIPA. Hypotension alone poorly predicted the need for operation (13%), ETI (17%), or blood transfusion (22%). In contrast, operation (30%), ETI (40%), and blood transfusion (53%) were more likely in children with an elevated SIPA (Table 1).  25 children required all three interventions, 3 (12%) were hypotensive at presentation, 15 (60%) had an elevated SIPA (P&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Elevated SIPA is superior to age-adjusted hypotension to identify injured children likely to require emergent operation, ETI or early blood transfusion. 10% of injured children requiring early intervention demonstrated age specific hypotension. Using SIPA, an age-adjusted tool employing both heart rate and SBP, tripled the number of high-risk children identified who needed intervention. Still nearly half of significantly injured children requiring at least one acute intervention were not identified by either hypotension or SIPA. Thus, SIPA, like age-adjusted hypotension cannot be relied upon solely for trauma team activation.  However, SIPA, rather than age-adjusted hypotension, should be considered as one of the six minimum criteria for trauma team activation.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Binary independent predictors were generated from birth weight, 5-minute Apgar score, and the presence of pulmonary hypertension, major congenital cardiac and/or chromosomal anomalies. Performance of the CDHSG clinical prediction model (i.e. total CDH score) on our VS-PDD cohort was validated in terms of discrimination and calibration.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 3,213,822 live births in California during the study period. We extracted 753 newborns with the diagnosis of CDH, an incidence of ~1/4,250 births. Forty-eight infants (6.4%) were excluded due to incomplete birth information, leaving a total of 705 unique infants with CDH in our study cohort (N=705). The majority was male (58.6%) and the median gestational age, birth weight, and 5-minute Apgar score were 38.7 weeks, 3000 g, and 8 respectively. Pulmonary hypertension was present in 30.1%, while major cardiac and chromosomal anomalies were found in 18.4% and 7.9% of our cohort. CDH newborns in our cohort were delivered in 150 different hospitals, whereas only 28 hospitals performed CDH repairs (1-85 repairs per hospital).The observed mortality for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups according to the total CDH score were 7.7%, 34.3%, and 54.7%, while the predicted mortality for these three risk groups were 4.0%, 23.2%, and 58.5%.

This study compared the outcomes of a pediatric surgical condition, perforated appendicitis, in two models&mdash;one where patients are managed by pediatric hospitalists with pediatric surgeons consulting and one where patients are managed by pediatric surgeons.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:     We reviewed the data of patients aged under 13 with perforated appendicitis from 2002 to 2012 in two health systems&mdash;one where patients are admitted to the pediatric surgical service and one where patients are admitted to the pediatric hospitalist service with surgeons as consultants.

Treatment and outcomes related characteristics of each group are shown in Table 1.  Compared to the SG, the HG patients had a statistically significant higher number of laboratory tests, consults, and imaging tests.  The SG patients were more likely to have ultrasound exams while the HG patients trended toward the use of more CT scans.   There was little difference in the number of patients undergoing IR procedures or PICC lines.    The total length of stay was greater in the HG but this did not reach statistical significance. <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:   Pediatric patients with perforated appendicitis managed by pediatric hospitalists are exposed to a more laboratory tests, consults, and imaging studies which may add to hospital costs and resource use as compared to those managed by pediatric surgeons.   There may be nuances in managing a surgical disease which are better appreciated by a surgeon.  Also, a pediatric surgeon may be better acquainted with the use of ultrasound in appendicitis which has consequences regarding radiation exposure.

Efforts are needed to understand their unique health needs. Previous studies have found that universal access to insurance mitigates racial/ethnic disparities in younger adults. However, little is known about the role of race/ethnicity in post-discharge outcomes after EGS among older patients. The objective of this study was to determine whether racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes persist among Medicare beneficiaries requiring EGS consultations/care.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Seven years (2005-2011) of Medicare data were queried for patients with a primary EGS diagnosis, defined by the AAST, who were admitted to inpatient status through the ED and had racial/ethnicity data recorded for a single race/ethnicity. Associations with demographic, clinical, and hospital-level factors were considered using descriptive statistics. Risk-adjusted multilevel logistic regression assessed differences in in-hospital mortality and mortality, major morbidity, and readmission rates at 30, 90, and 180 days. Differences in discharge disposition, including utilization of hospice or rehabilitation, were also considered.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 7,763,510 patients were identified: 85.5% White, 9.6% Black, 2.1% Hispanic, and 1.1% Asian/Pacific Islander. Older adults were approximately evenly distributed across 5-year increments of age (15.2-19.6%) with 9.9% (n=770,560) aged &ge;90y. One-fifth (22.2%) was managed in the ICU (1.0% surgical; 9.9% general), and 32.7% had a CCI &ge;3. Overall risk-adjusted outcomes are presented (Table). Worse outcomes among older minority patients were not consistently found; differences in mortality decreased, while disparities in morbidity/readmission paradoxically remained. Stratification by diagnostic group and among patients restricted to octogenarian/nonagenarians - known to experience different outcomes than younger geriatric patients (65-80y) - revealed similarly mixed associations.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Lack of significant differences for in-hospital/90-day mortality and protective effects reported at 30 days between Black and White patients suggest that enhanced insurance coverage of emergency surgical care among older adult patients is associated with mitigation of racial/ethnic disparities. Akin to older trauma patients, who show lower inpatient mortality for Black versus White patients, older adult EGS patients demonstrate persistent differences between Black and White patients in longer-term (30/90/180-day) survival that extend well beyond index hospital stays. Ongoing efforts are needed to understand the persistence of disparities in morbidity and readmission rates.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Patients with a positive culture within 4 days of admission (EARLY) were compared to those with a positive culture after 4 days (LATE).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 163 elderly trauma patients requiring ventilator support were identified, of whom 126 (77.3%) had cultures sent during hospitalization. Of these cultured patients, 96 (76.2%) had at least one positive culture. Fifty-one (53.1%) were EARLY and 46 (46.9%) were LATE. The two cohorts were similar in age, gender, admission systolic blood pressure (SBP), mechanism of injury, and injury severity score (ISS). The EARLY cohort had lower admission GCS (10.4 &plusmn; 4.6 v. 12.6 &plusmn; 3.6, p = 0.008), shorter ventilator days (6.8 &plusmn; 5.7 v. 13.9 &plusmn; 15.3, p = 0.004), hospital length of stay (LOS) (14.8 &plusmn; 9.5 v. 31.4 &plusmn; 22.0, p &lt; 0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (9.5 &plusmn; 6.6 v. 13.0 &plusmn; 9.5, p = 0.005), but higher mortality (43.1% v. 17.8%, p = 0.007).  Multivariate analysis demonstrated that having an early positive culture was a predictor of higher mortality (AOR 3.77, p = 0.008).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Early infection in mechanically ventilated elderly trauma patients is associated with high mortality. Damage control cultures in this population may identify early infections, allowing for early treatment with reduced mortality.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Patients who suffered traumatic rib fractures between January 2013 and April 2015 were identified by CPT codes for possible inclusion in the study.  Individual computer tomography scans of the chest were reviewed and validated by staff radiology reads. The location of the rib fractures were characterized in terms of anterior, posterior, lateral, upper, middle, lower, and right vs. left.  SAS statistical software, logistic regression curves and ANOVA data analysis examined the data for relationships between rib fracture location and patient outcomes in terms of length of stay, ICU length of stay, discharge disposition and overall mortality. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 929 patients were initially reviewed for possible inclusion in the study and 248 excluded. A total of 3,864 fractures were identified in the patient population.  Statistically significant positive correlation coefficients were identified between length of stay and number of rib fractures in all locations with the strongest relationships seen in the upper (0.191, p=&lt;0.0001), middle (0.185, p=&lt;0.0001) and lateral (0.189, p=&lt;0.0001) locations.  Similarly, statistically significant correlations were seen between all rib fracture locations and ICU days with the strongest relationships seen in patients with upper (0.184, p=&lt;0.0001), middle (0.189, p=&lt;0.0001) and lateral (0.205, p=&lt;0.0001) fractures. In addition, there was a statistically significant association between in hospital mortality and lateral rib fractures, with the non-survivors having on average 2 more lateral rib fractures than survivors (p=.0192), and left-sided rib fractures, with the non-survivors also having on average 2 more left-sided rib fractures than survivors (p=.0287).  A statistically significant association was seen between discharge disposition and left-sided fractures (p=0.0160) as well as lateral rib fractures (p=0.0002). There was a linear relationship between type of discharge, in terms of increasing need for support, and number of lateral rib fractures.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Rib fracture location, particularly left sidedness and lateral location, help predict outcomes in terms of mortality and discharge disposition.

Massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) offer a long-proven benefit in resuscitation of these patients and recently, the superiority of TEG-guided resuscitation over pre-determined component ratio strategies has been established. However, optimal cutoff values for TEG-driven interventions have yet to be identified. We seek to establish optimal thresholds for r-TEG driven resuscitation based on prospective data collected in severely injured patients at risk for trauma-induced coagulopathy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  R-TEG data was reviewed for patients from 3 randomized, prospective studies conducted at a level 1 trauma center from September 26, 2010 to June 30, 2015. Criteria for inclusion were highest-level trauma activation in patients &ge; 18 years of age with hypotension presumed due to acute blood loss. Patients were excluded if an r-TEG was not sent within one hour of injury, injuries were deemed unsalvageable or in cases of isolated GSW to the head, pregnancy, or liver disease. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to test the predictive performance of r-TEG for substantial transfusion requirement, defined &ge; 4 units of RBCs in the first hour of hospitalization. Cut-point analysis, utilizing Youden Index, distance to (0,1) and sensitivity, specificity equality was then performed on these ROC curves to determine optimal thresholds for TEG-based resuscitation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: ROC analysis of r-TEG data from194 patients who met inclusion criteria in one of three concurrent prospective studies yielded areas under the curve (AUC) with respect to substantial transfusion requirement greater than 70% for ACT, &alpha;, MA and LY30 (70%, 82%, 80% and 71% respectively).

Previous data in both adults and children has shown that hyperfibrinolysis (HF) is associated with a doubling in mortality. Recently, data in adults has demonstrated that fibrinolysis shutdown (SD), an acute impairment of fibrinolysis, is also associated with significant increases in mortality. The purpose of the current study was to assess (1) the incidence and presentation of fibrinolysis phenotypes in pediatric trauma patients and (2) the impact of SD on mortality among these patients. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Pediatric trauma patients (0-17 years of age) who (1) were admitted 2010-2014, (2) met highest-level trauma activation and (3) had severe anatomic injury were included in this analysis. Severe anatomic injury was defined as injury severity score (ISS) &gt;15.  Admission fibrinolysis phenotypes were defined by the clot lysis measured by TEG at 30 minutes (LY30): SD &le; 0.8%, physiologic 0.9-2.9%, HF &ge; 3%. Massive transfusion was defined as &gt;10 U RBC in 6 hours. Continuous and dichotomous variables were evaluated with ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis, respectively. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 489 patients met inclusion. 34% demonstrated evidence of SD on arrival (38% were physiologic, 28% were HF). SD patients were older (median age 16 vs. 12;p&lt;0.001) and more likely to be female (41 vs. 28%;p=0.044) compares to HF. WHile mechanism and ISS were similar between SD and HF, ISS was higher in HF than in the physiologic group (median 27 vs. 25; p=0.010). Arrival blood pressure, pulse and GCS were similar between the three groups. SD patients were more hypocoagulable by TEG k-time (median 1.5 vs. 1.3 min;p=0.029), and alpha-angle (72 vs. 73 deg; p=0.020) than the HF cohort. HF were more hypocoagulable than physiologic group by TEG ACT (median 128 vs. 121 sec; p=0.002) and mA (62 vs. 64 mm; p=0.003). All other arrival labs were similar between groups.  Both SD and HF patients had incresed massive transfusion (12 and 10%, respectively vs. 3%; p=0.004) and mortality rates (19 and 20%, respectively vs. 8%; p=0.003) compared to the physiologic group (FIGURE). When the analysis was repeated among only those children 5 years of age or less, the results were similar, including that of higher mortality (SD: 15 vs. HF: 10 vs. physiologic: 2%; p=0.026). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Fibrinolysis shutdown (SD) appears to carry similar mortality risk to that of HF among severely injured children. The current study provides additional evidence of distinct phenotypes of coagulation impairment and that individualized hemostatic therapy may be required.

Still, our knowledge of post-injury hematologic parameters is incomplete. This study compares fluctuations of platelet and red blood cell (RBC) indices in patients with splenic injuries who underwent clinical observation (O), embolization (E), or splenectomy (S) during the first 45 post-injury days. We hypothesized that patterns of thrombocytosis, RBC and/or RBC indices (RBCI) vary across the three treatment approaches.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Following IRB approval at three institutions, a retrospective study of platelet/RBC and RBCI (red blood cell distribution volume - RDW / mean corpuscular volume - MCV) was conducted (Mar 2000 - Dec 2014). We studied patients with admission lengths of &gt;96 hours giving representative samples for each sub-group (O, E, and S). Demographics and injury severity data were abstracted. Composite 7-period moving average graphs of platelet counts and RBC/RBCI from the time of admission to the latest available lab draw (or 45 days maximum) were constructed. Non-parametric statistical testing for any corresponding differences was then performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Multiple data points (n=1,110) from 75 patients (25 S, 29 E, 32 O) were analyzed for each study parameter. Median age was 41 years with median ISS 22 (21 for S, 19 for E, 22 for O, p=n/s), median GCS 15, 67% male. Median splenic injury grade followed interventional modality (grade 4 for S, 3 for E, 2 for O). There were no differences in RBC count for the three groups (p=n/s). In aggregate, RDW was greater following S (14.9%) than E (14.3%) or O (13.5%, p&lt;0.01) with the three converging by day 45. Despite temporal variability, MCV was highest for the &quot;observation&quot; group (92.3 vs 91.1 in E and 90.6 in S, p&lt;0.01). For platelets, there were no differences between composite values for S (mean, 378.8) and E (350.1), with both being greater than the O group (272.3, p&lt;0.01) between 15-41 days. Prior to day 15, all groups had similar platelet counts; after day 41, the O and E groups converged at levels approximating 50% of the S group.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study describes important trends and patterns in RBC, RBCI, and platelets following splenic injuries managed with S, E, or O. Although no differences were noted in RBC counts between therapies, RDW was significantly greater following S than either E or O. MCV displayed significant temporal variability. Finally, platelet counts were similar for both S and E during peak elevations (days 15-41), followed by convergence of E &amp; O groups at normal levels around day 45. Our results provide a foundation for further research in this still poorly explored area, with focus on clinical relevance of observed patterns.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Improperly placed tubes are common with rates near 30%. Management includes observation, repositioning, replacement, additional TT placement, or early surgical intervention. This study was performed to determine whether TT position affects the rate of secondary intervention.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using the trauma registry a retrospective review of all adult trauma patients undergoing bedside TT placement over a 4-year period was performed. Staff radiologist classified the position of original TT as ideal, non-ideal, or kinked based on AP chest x-ray. Ideal TTs were apically directed, terminating in the lateral or mid thoracic cavity. Non-ideal TT was defined within the fissure or supra-diaphragmatic position. TTs with sentinel hole outside the thoracic cavity were excluded. The primary outcome was any secondary intervention (TT replacement, additional TT tube placement, or surgical intervention).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:486 adult trauma patients (547 hemithoraces) underwent TT placement and met inclusion criteria. Indications for placement were HPTx (37.2%), HTx (28.8 %), and PTx (34.0%). The majority of patients were male (76%), median age of 41 years (IQR 26-55 years), and blunt (67.9%) trauma. Ideal TT positioning in 429 (78.4%) and non-ideal in 118 (21.6%) hemithoraces. Secondary intervention rate was 27.8% including 109 (19.9%) additional / replaced TT, 31 (5.7%) VATS, and 12 (2.2%) thoracotomies. Rate of secondary intervention for ideal and non-ideal TT position was 25.1% and 37.3% (p=0.009) respectively. Kinked TTs were noted in 33 (6%) hemithoraces with a 45.5% secondary intervention rate. Due to likelihood for treatment bias, kinked TTs were removed from final analysis. Subsequently, the rate of secondary intervention was no longer significant (25.1% vs 34.1%, p=0.09). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Position of a non-kinked TT with the sentinel hole within the thoracic cavity does not affect secondary intervention rates, including the rate of surgical intervention. Inherent practice bias demonstrates with ideal position surgeons are significantly more likely to proceed with early operative intervention. Given over 20% of individuals with additional TT placement required operative intervention for definitive management, early operative intervention in the setting of non-kinked TT provides ideal patient care.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

However, only single center studies have previously described the epidemiology of CS; and the long-term outcomes for these patients have yet to be reported. In this study, we sought to describe the epidemiology of CS and the rate of subsequent limb loss using a comprehensive statewide inpatient database. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All CS diagnoses (ICD-9-CM 729.7* and 958.9*) were extracted from the California State Inpatient Database (2007-2011), which is an all-payer dataset that captures 98% of hospital admissions. The SID was linked to the AHA Annual Survey Database to include hospital-level characteristics and the US census (2010) provided a population denominator. Patients were tracked longitudinally using a unique identifier within the SID to identify 30-day readmissions to any hospital in California and subsequent need for amputation within 12 months. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for amputation. The covariates within this model were age, race, sex, payer status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Injury Severity Score, lower/upper limb, weekend admission, trauma center designation, hospital bed size, and teaching hospital status. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 6,471 CS cases - 1,294 per year, or an annual incidence of 3.5 per 100,000 population. The mean age was 46.2 (SD 20.0). Patients were predominantly male (73.6%), white (58.6%), publicly insured (41.1%), and admitted to either a level 1 (44.1%) or level 2 trauma center (46.8%). Most cases (61.0%) were secondary to trauma and the majority of these (63.5%) were associated with fracture. Both traumatic and non-traumatic CS predominantly affected the lower limb (71.3% and 72.1% respectively).3,119 (48.2%) of patients suffered complications, 325 (5.0%) died, 670 (10.4%) required unplanned re-admission within 30 days, and 95 (1.5%) required a major amputation within 12 months of discharge. Most amputations (87.4%) occurred during subsequent admissions and not during the acute hospitalization. Significant independent risk factors for major amputation were lower limb CS (OR 9.0, 95% CI 3.29-24.7) and a non-traumatic cause (OR 4.72, 95% CI 2.6-8.7). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:CS is an infrequent but potentially devastating diagnosis that can lead to limb loss.

There is currently no estimate for the number of TBI patients treated outside of the ED. In an effort to address the dearth of what is known about patients who seek other types of care, the objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of TBI among a national sample of adults who died in hospital, were admitted for inpatient hospitalization and survived, were discharged from the ED, or were treated exclusively in an outpatient setting.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  2010-2012 MarketScan inpatient/outpatient databases, &gt;100 commercial insurers/56 million enrollees, were queried for adults (18-64y) with CDC-defined TBI. A restricted definition excluding optic (951.1-3), SBS (995.55), and unspecified head (959.01) injuries was also employed. In order to ascertain representativeness, weighted death/inpatient/ED data were extracted from the 2010-2012 NIS and NEDS. Initial patient visits from each were categorized by the highest level of healthcare received. In MarketScan, differences relative to the outpatient setting were examined for significant associations with demographic, case-mix (CCI, LOC, head AIS, ISS, morbidity), managing provider(s), and diagnosis-related factors. Annual rates per 100,000 adult enrollees/US population and estimates of the national burden were calculated by pyramid treatment-tier, using stratified data from each.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The study identified 673,239 incident TBI in MarketScan, of which 59.9% (n=402,987) were managed in the outpatient setting. 107,876 (weighted n=536,419) inpatients and 856,864 (n=3,858,239) ED presentations were identified in NIS and NEDS. In both, privately insured patients (68.1% of the adult US population) represented half (48.7%; 47.2%) of TBI. Demographic/Clinical factors were predominately comparable between datasets at parallel treatment-tiers. Annual incidences are presented (table). Despite being less severely injured than patients in higher treatment-tiers, a 2012 outpatient incidence of 415.6 TBI per 100,000 adult enrollees suggests an annual national burden due to outpatient consultations of nearly 1 million initial physician visits, &gt;301,000 hours of primary care physician time, and thousands more hours of follow-up treatment/care.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The results demonstrate a larger number of patients requiring TBI assessment/care than previous estimates describe.

We aimed to characterize the variation in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (VTEP) across trauma centers, and the impact of this variation on the risk of PE.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Data were derived from the ACS Trauma Quality Improvement Program between 2013 and 2014. Patients with blunt multi-system injury admitted for at least 72 hours were included. Patients with severe head injuries were excluded, recognizing that VTEP practices may be distinct in these patients. Patients who never received any VTEP during admission were excluded. Centers with a median time of initiation of &lt;48 hours were classified as early starters (ES) of VTEP. We evaluated the impact of centers' classification as ES or late starters (LS) on rates of pulmonary embolism. Multivariable marginal logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the association between center-level VTE practices and PE after adjusting for case mix. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 12,596 patients meeting inclusion criteria were identified at 177 trauma centers. The median time to VTEP across all centers was 45 (IQR 25) hours. The most commonly administered VTEP agent was low-molecular weight heparin (82%, N=10,269); 17% (N=2156) received unfractionated heparin. The incidence of PE was 2% (N=299) overall; 3% (N=196) in ES and 2% (N=103) in LS centers. After adjusting for case mix and center-level clustering, there was no association between PE rates and care received in an ES vs LS center (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.69-1.32). The effect of receiving care at an ES vs LS center was not modified by choice of VTEP agent, though prophylaxis with heparin was associated with a significant increase in PE rates (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.09-2.28).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Great variability in time to VTEP exists amongst trauma centers. No significant association between center VTEP timing and hospital-level PE rates was identified. This may represent varying center-level practices not measured in TQIP, such as use of non-chemical means of VTEP, practices related to early mobility or other as yet unidentified strategies that mitigate PE risk.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

After excluding centers performing fewer than 10 procedures during the study period, between 66 and 166 centers were included in each procedure analysis. Hospitals in the lowest quartiles of both mortality rate and cost were characterized as high-performing (n=45), and hospitals in the highest quartiles of cost and mortality as low-performing (n=45) (Figure 1). High-performing hospitals for one procedure were never low-performing for another procedure.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: On average, high-performing hospitals had lower proportions of Medicaid patient days (17.5% vs 29.7%; p&lt;0.01), higher proportions of outpatient surgery (62.9% vs 53.3%), and spent more on capital expenditures per bed ($155,710 vs $62,434; p&lt;0.05).

AAS membership was determined from a past and present membership registry.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Overall, 912 (22.7%) of all 4,015 surgical faculty examined were AAS members. Median publications (P) and citations (C) (&plusmn;SD) were: 54&plusmn;96 and 985&plusmn;3321 for AAS members compared with 31&plusmn;92 and 528&plusmn;3001 for non-members (p &lt; 0.001). The greater academic productivity of AAS members was observed across all subspecialties and was especially pronounced for assistant and associate professors [Table 1]. AAS membership was also associated with significantly increased rates of NIH funding both for training grants such as those of the K-series and R-awards. Among AAS members, 13.4% had current or former R01/P01/U01grants compared with only 9% of AAS non-members (p &lt; 0.05). AAS members also had two times as many current or previous smaller NIH awards (13.9% vs. 6.2%, p &lt; 0.05) Analysis of AAS membership by subspecialty revealed that AAS members were most commonly general surgery faculty (58%). AAS membership was lowest in cardiothoracic surgery, plastic surgery and among Ph.D. faculty working in departments of surgery; however, AAS members from these subspecialties had significantly greater academic  output compared with AAS non-members as well. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: AAS membership is associated with substantially better academic metrics and NIH funding rates for junior and midlevel surgical faculty across all subspecialties. Individuals and academic departments interested in improving publications and funding should encourage participation in the AAS.

Smart phone based thermal imaging utilizing forward looking infrared imaging (FLIR) can easily determine temperature of the extremity. This study reports on the feasibility of using smart phone based FLIR to assess peripheral perfusion by measurement of extremity temperature.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients seen in a vascular clinic with ABI's measured by an ICAVL certified vascular lab were selected. Patients then underwent imaging using a smart phone based FLIR. Color spectrograph was taken and surface temperature of each extremity was determined and recorded. A single operator who was blinded to ABI's results obtained all images. Comparison between ABI and extremity's temperature was performed. Thermal ankle brachial index (TABI) was calculated by dividing the temperature of the lower extremity by that of the upper extremity. Temperature accuracy of FLIR was determined against known standard. Statistical analysis was done using Pearson's correlation and Bland-Altman plot.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 23 patients had both ABI and extremity temperature recorded on the same day resulting in 45 lower extremities analyzed (one patient has a BKA). ABI ranged from 0.33 to 1.46 with mean (IQR) of 0.92 (0.35). Lower extremity temperature ranged from 60.67 to 96.87&deg;F with mean of 83.41 (14.10).  Upper extremity range was 81.86 to 94.60&deg;F with mean of 91.03 (3.44). Positive correlation between ABI and FLIR temperature was seen with Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.66 p = .001, n = 45. Using ABI and the newly described TABI, positive correlation was also seen with r = 0.83, p &lt; .0001, n = 45 (Fig 1).  Thermal sensitivity of FLIR was determined at 0.18&deg;F. When comparing against known standard, thermal imaging has an average of 3.16% error across temperature range of 34 to 144&deg;F.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Smart phone based FLIR imaging can be used to reliably determine extremity perfusion as an alternative to traditional ABI measurement.

However, non-operative management is an important component of surgical care that does not currently factor in to surgical quality assessment. Our objectives were (1) to examine the incidence of non-operative management for common general surgical problems, (2) to assess hospital-level variability in non-operative management rates, and (3) to identify hospital characteristics associated with a greater likelihood of non-operative management.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using the 2006-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), urgent and emergent adult hospital admissions for small bowel obstruction (SBO), diverticulitis, acute calculous cholecystitis, and acute appendicitis were identified. To estimate the prevalence of non-operative management, the annual number of admissions and unadjusted non-operative rates were calculated using NIS discharge weights. To highlight variability in rates of non-operative management, hospital operative rates were estimated using a hierarchical logistic regression model to account for heterogeneity in patient populations. Operative rates were adjusted for patient age, sex, payer, Elixhauser comorbidities, and hospital diagnosis mix. Lastly, hospitals were separated into quartiles based on hospital-specific odds ratios for operative management, risk-adjusted operative rates were calculated, and characteristics differentiating hospitals in the highest and lowest quartiles were identified.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the included admissions, 97,281 were for SBO, 268,205 for diverticulitis, 300,312 for cholecystitis, and 217,403 for appendicitis. These four diagnoses account for an average annual national estimate of 694,303 admissions, 36.7% of which are managed non-operatively. Unadjusted rates of non-operative management were 33.7% for SBO, 87.6% for diverticulitis, 17.3% for cholecystitis, and 3.7% for appendicitis. Unadjusted rates of non-operative management increased over the study period (35.8% to 37.6%, p&lt;0.001). The average overall risk-adjusted rate for non-operative management was 36.4%, ranging from a mean of 35.6% in the lowest quartile to 43.9% in the highest. When compared to hospitals with the lowest rates of non-operative management, hospitals with the highest rates were more likely to have fewer beds, fewer annual discharges, be government owned, non-teaching, designated as rural, or located in the Midwest (all p&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Non-operative management of common general surgery problems occurs in more than a third of patients, who by design, are excluded from most efforts to measure and improve surgical quality. The lack of performance assessment for non-operative management leaves a considerable quality blind spot and efforts to better measure the quality of non-operative management are needed.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

The pledge sets specific volume thresholds for several operations, including a minimum of 20 pancreatectomies per year. The purpose of this study is to identify the socioeconomic and geographic factors which characterize patients 'at risk' to lose access to cancer care if volume thresholds were enforced.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We utilized the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Database from Florida to identify patients that underwent pancreatectomy for pancreatic malignancy between 2007 and 2011. American Hospital Association Annual Survey database and U.S. Census Bureau were linked to HCUP-SID patient-level data. High volume centers were defined as performing &gt;=20 pancreatic resections per year. Univariate and multivariate analysis compared patient characteristics and utilization of high volume centers. Distances between patient and hospital were calculated using straight line distance between patient and hospital zip codes. Classification and Regression Tree modeling was used to predict patients at risk for losing access to care.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Our study population included 1,663 patients. Five institutions were classified as high volume centers (performed at least 100 procedures over the 5 year study period) and they treated 1,056 (63.5%) of all patients. Patients residing far from high volume institutions, with lower education level, non-Caucasian ethnicity, income above $40,000/year, and living in zip codes with the lowest population densities had decreased odds of obtaining care at high volume hospitals (see Table). To reach the closest high volume center, 518 (85.3%) of patients currently being cared for in low volume institutions would require an additional 36.9 miles of travel (12.9 times further). Using these factors, we developed a CART-based predictive tool to identify patients that currently undergo surgery at low volume centers (cross validated error = 34.70%, c-statistic = 0.699, accuracy = 68.31%).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Implementation of the 'Take the Volume Pledge' is an important step to improving surgical outcomes, however policymakers must consider its potential impact on preventing access and possible health disparities that may arise as a result. Specifically, we identify African-American and Hispanic patients residing far from high volume institutions as a potential vulnerable population in the state of Florida. Our predictive model offers a tool to identify patients that may be vulnerable to losing access to surgical care.","Outcomes/Clinical","Disparities and Access to Care","Cross Disciplinary"

Sellke<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Brown University School Of Medicine,Cardiothoracic/Surgery,Providence, RI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is often associated with the increased vascular permeability/tissue edema, microvascular endothelial cell injury/dysfunction. Especially, these disturbances are more pronounced in patients with poorly controlled diabetes. Recent study has demonstrated that the increased permeability after cardiopleogic arrest/CPB is associated with changes in the expression/phosphorylation of adherence-junction-proteins in the coronary vasculature in patients with type-2 diabetes (T2DM). We hypothesized that T2DM may be associated with altered adherence-junction-protein expression/phosphorylation of skeletal muscle/vessel in the setting of CPB . The aim of the current study was to investigate the changes in adherens-junction-proteins, such as VE-cadherin, and &beta;-catenin of skeletal muscle and vessels in patients with or without T2DM in the setting of CPB and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Chest wall skeletal muscle tissue was harvested pre- and post-CPB from the controlled diabetic (HbA1c: 6.3 &plusmn; 0.1), uncontrolled diabetic (HbA1c: 9.6 &plusmn; 0.3) and non-diabetic patients (HbA1c: 5.4 &plusmn; 0.1) undergoing CABG surgery (n = 6/group).  The expression/phosphorylation of adherence-junction-proteins such as, VE-cadherin and &beta;-catenin were assessed by immunoblotting and immuno-histochemistry.  Skeletal-muscle-arteriolar endothelial function was assessed by videomicroscopy in response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator substance P.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were no significant differences in basal protein expression of VE-cadherin between UDM and CDM or ND patients or between pre- and post-CPB among groups. The level of pre-CPB phosphorylated VE-cadherin tends to be 25% higher in the UDM group compared with ND (P = 0.03). CPB induced more phosphorylation   of VE-cadherin (21% in ND; 30% in CDM and 43% vs. pre-CPB; P&lt;0.05, respectively) and this effect was more pronounced in the UDM group (P&lt;0.05 vs. ND or CDM). The post-CPB &beta;-catenin was significantly decreased as compared with pre-CPB in all three groups (P&lt;0.05) and the decrease was more pronounced in the UDM group (P&lt;0.05). There were significantly decreases in vasodilatory response of skeletal muscle arterioles to substance P after CPB in all three groups (P&lt;0.05). This alteration was more pronounced in the UDM patients (P&lt;0.05). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These findings suggest that poorly controlled diabetes down-regulates endothelial adherence-junction-protein expression of skeletal muscle/vessel tissues  in the setting of CPB. The enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of  VE-cadherin and degradation of &beta;-catenin indicates deterioration of these proteins and the damage of the cell-cell endothelial junctions, specifically in the diabetic vessels. These alterations may lead to the increases in periphral vascular permeability and endothelial dysfunction and affect the outcomes in diabetic patients after CPB/cardiac surgery.","Basic Science","Cardiovascular Biology/Physiology","Cardiothoracic"

Currently, general anesthesia (GA) is the accepted approach in those patients requiring transfemoral vascular access, however emerging data suggests that outcomes can be improved using local anesthesia (LA). The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes of patients with severe, symptomatic aortic valve stenosis undergoing transfemoral TAVR using general versus local anesthesia.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of patients undergoing TAVR from December 2013 to June 2015 was performed. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Demographic information and outcome data were collected regarding type of anesthesia, procedural success, respiratory complications and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 30 patients (12 GA, 18 LA) underwent transfemoral TAVR. Average age for GA patients was 80.6 years and 81.3 years for LA patients (p=0.82). M:F ratio was 1:1 for GA patients, and 5:13 for LA patients (p=0.22). Average Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score for GA patients was 9.6, and 7.8 for LA patients (p=0.30). [Figure 1]  Five (41.7%) patients in the GA group had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 10 (55.6%) patients in the LA group had COPD (p=0.46). The Medtronic CoreValve was used in 2 patients undergoing GA and 9 patients with LA (p=0.06), while the Edward SAPIEN prosthesis was implanted in 10 patients receiving GA and 9 patients receiving LA. Procedural success was 100% in both groups.  Operative times averaged 125.3 (88-207) minutes in the GA group and 109.6 (60-168) minutes in the LA group (p=0.13). No LA patient required conversion to GA. Ten GA patients (83.3%) were extubated in the operating room, while 1 (5.6%) LA patient required intubation on post-operative day 8 due to COPD exacerbation. Average intensive care unit stay (ICU) was 3.1 (1-8) days for GA patients and 2.4 (0-11) days for LA patients (p=0.32). Average hospital stay for GA patients was 6.9 (2-14) days and 5.5 (2-12) days for LA patients (p=0.36). 30-day mortality was 0 in GA group and 5.6% (n=1) in the LA group.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: LA for transfemoral TAVR procedures is feasible and yields similar procedural outcomes as GA techniques.  Although patients receiving LA had a higher incidence of COPD, fewer of these patients had post-operative respiratory complications and there were shorter ICU and hospital lengths of stay.  Future studies will need to compare procedural and total hospital costs between these two anesthetic approaches.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Cardiothoracic"

SPM is relatively uncommon, and the clinical significance and risk associated with SPM is not well understood and has not been widely documented in the literature.  Our goals were to determine the outcomes of patients who presented with SPM and to determine predictors of severe pathology associated with SPM. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  From 2004 through 2013, a retrospective review was conducted of all patients who were discovered to have SPM during presentation to our institution.  Patient demographics, co-morbidities, laboratory values and presence of esophageal perforation were recorded. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over the 10 year span of the study 249 patients who presented to our institution were discovered to have spontaneous pneumomediastinum on chest x-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan.  Mean age was 38.7 years (1&mdash;93).    Sixty-one percent (151/249) of patients were male.  Subcutaneous emphysema was appreciated in 16 percent (39/249) of patients.  Ten percent (24/249) of all patients were ultimately discovered to have esophageal perforation, determined by upper endoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series or intraoperatively during emergent surgery.  Age (p &lt;0.01), presence of pleural effusion (p &lt; 0.01) and elevated white blood count (p &lt; 0.01) were the only significant risk factors for presence of esophageal perforation (Table 1).  Other variables, such as subcutaneous emphysema, elevated creatinine level and oxygen saturation were not associated with esophageal perforation. <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: SPM is usually associated with a benign clinical course.  Risk factors for presence of esophageal perforation in these patients include age, elevated white blood count and presence of a pleural effusion.  In the absence of abnormal laboratory values or associated radiologic findings, the majority of patients with SPM can be safely observed without the need for further diagnostic testing.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Cardiothoracic"

However, these patients have a high associated incidence of peripheral vascular disease which can preclude delivery from a transfemoral (TF) approach.  Alternative delivery options include transapical (TA) and trans-aortic (TAo).  The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of TAVR procedures performed via a TAo approach versus a non-TAo approach.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of patients undergoing TAVR from December 2013 to June 2015 was performed. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Demographic information and outcome data were collected regarding type of vascular access, procedural success, and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Forty-two patients (10 TAo, 30 TF, 2 TA) underwent TAVR. Average age for TAo patients was 73.6 years and 80.3 years for non-TAo patients (p=0.11). M:F ratio was 1:9 for TAo patients, and 3:5 for non-TAo patients (p=0.10). Average Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score for TAo patients was 11.8, and 8.5 for non-TAo patients (p=0.18). [Figure 1] Seven (70%) patients in the TAo group had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 16 (50%) patients in the non-TAo group had COPD (p=0.27). The Medtronic CoreValve was used in 4 patients undergoing TAo and 11 patients with non-TAo (p=0.75), while the Edward SAPIEN prosthesis was implanted in 6 patients receiving TAo and 21 patients in the non-TAo group. Procedural success was 100% in both groups. Operative times averaged 144.2 (99-203) minutes in the TAo group and 117.9 (60-207) minutes in the TF/TA group (p=0.048). Four TAo patients (40%) were extubated in the operating room, while 29 (90.6%) non-TAo patients were extubated in the operating room (p=0.00066). Average intensive care unit stay (ICU) was 4 (2-12) days for TAo patients and 2.35 (0-11) days for non-TAo patients (p=0.14). Average hospital stay for TAo patients was 10.2 (4-28) days and 4.9 (2-14) days for non-TAo patients (p=0.035). 30-day mortality was 10% (n=1) in TAo group and 3.1% (n=1) in the non-TAo group (p=0.37). 1-year mortality was 10% (n=1) in TAo group and 9.3% (n=3) in the TF/TA group (p=0.95).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: TAo is a suitable alternative access point for TAVR patients unable to undergo a TF approach due to severe peripheral vascular disease.

Despite improved patient selection, evolving operative and anesthesia techniques, and better control of comorbid conditions, patient-level risk factors of open repair remain to be fully understood. We sought to evaluate risk factors affecting operative mortality of open TAA and DTA repair in a nationally validated multi-specialty dataset.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified all TAA &ndash; including all Crawford extent types &ndash; and DTA cases in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database between years 2005 to 2013. Operative mortality was defined as death within 30 days of surgery. A logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate the risk of patient's age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), comorbid conditions, functional status, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, smoking status, alcohol intake, preoperative blood transfusion, rupture status, DTA vs combined Crawford extents, operating surgical specialty, preoperative hematocrit and creatinine levels.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 1,048 patients had open TAA or DTA repair during the 9-year study period.

Six patients who expired during the index hospitalization were excluded from the analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the sample (n=127) 98 (77%) patients were readmitted 324 times (3.3 times/patient) as of end of follow-up. The median follow-up period was 56 (IQR: 21-105) months. Median time to first readmission was 59 (IQR: 10-185) days. Over half of readmissions (n=186; 57%) were within the first year post-discharge at index hospitalization. Of those, 52 (28%) were within 30 days post-discharge. Freedom from first readmission was observed for 66% of patients at 1 month, 51% at 3 months, 29% at 6 months and 18% at 12 months (Figure). Median hospital length of stay at readmission was 3 (IQR: 2, 6) days.

Recently, the del Nido cardioplegia solution has been utilized in pediatric cardiac operations and utilizes lidocaine rather than potassium to achieve diastolic arrest. Compared to conventional Buckberg cardioplegia it has the added benefit of only requiring one dose for up to 180 minutes of myocardial quiescence. By lowering cardioplegia volume, the del Nido method may reduce myocardial edema, hemodilution, arrhythmias and costs of care. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of del Nido cardioplegia in adult cardiac valvular operations.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The institutional Society of Thoracic Surgeons database was used to identify all adults undergoing aortic or mitral valve operations from January 2011 to May 2015. Patient demographics, operative characteristics and postoperative outcomes were gathered from the database as well as electronic medical records. Patients who received the del Nido solution (DN) were matched with those receiving conventional blood cardioplegia (CC) for procedure type as well as baseline characteristics such as age, gender, ejection fraction, diabetes, lung disease, among others. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA software (StataCorp, College Station) and P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the study period, 54 patients met criteria and were included in the DN group while another 54 were assigned to the CC group after matching for baseline characteristics. The groups did not differ significantly in comorbid conditions as shown in Table 1. Compared to the CC group, DN patients exhibited a shorter crossclamp time (122 minutes vs 125 minutes, P= 0.87), higher in-hospital ICU length of stay (98 hours vs 96 hours, P= 0.59), mortality rate (9.3% vs 1.8%, P= 0.10), red cell transfusions (1.9 units vs 1.6 units, P=0.74) and readmission rates (13.2% vs 5.6%, P= 0.18). The fall in hematocrit immediately after the operation was similar between the DN (7.3%) and CC (7.9%) cohorts (P=0.63). Inotrope use between DN and CC measured by a Vasoactive Inotropic Score were also similar in the intraoperative period (7.3 vs 6.1, P=0.54) and postoperative period (2.4 vs 3.1, P=0.73).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our data, although preliminary, suggests that the of del Nido cardioplegia solution was associated with a non-significant increase in mortality, readmission rate, ICU hours, and red cell transfusions. Given major differences in mechanism of action, the del Nido solution needs to be further evaluated in larger cohorts and include analysis of clinical as well echocardiographic outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Cardiothoracic"

Average age for low LVEF patients was 70.6 years and 79.8 years for high LVEF patients (p=0.22). M:F ratio was 1:4 for low LVEF patients, and 12:25 for high LVEF patients (p=0.57). Average Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score for low LVEF patients was 8.5, and 9.4 for high LVEF patients (p=0.32).

The Medtronic CoreValve was used in 3 patients with low preoperative LVEF and 12 patients with high LVEF (p=0.23), while the Edward SAPIEN prosthesis was implanted in 2 patients with low LVEF and 25 patients with high LVEF. Procedural success was 100% in both groups. Operative times averaged 125.4 (84-162) minutes in the low LVEF group and 124.0 (60-207) minutes in the high LVEF group (p=0.94). Four low LVEF patients (80%) were extubated in the operating room, while 29 (78.4%) high LVEF patients extubated in the operating room (p=0.94). Average intensive care unit stay (ICU) was 2.0 (1-3) days for low LVEF patients and 2.8 (0-12) days for high LVEF patients (p=0.14).

We hypothesize that durability of repair is related to geometry of initial repair, as well as stress distribution over the mitral valve and left ventricle. Previous studies demonstrate that repair by posterior leaflet resection increases stress across the posterior leaflet; we tested the hypothesis that repair by placement of prosthetic chordae tendinae resulted in reduced overall stress as compared to leaflet resection. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Magnetic resonance imaging and intra-operative 3D trans-esophageal echocardiography were performed before surgical repair of isolated P2 prolapse in a single patient. A finite element model of the left ventricle and mitral valve was created. Stress was examined in the preoperative state for the mitral valve and left ventricle, and for the following repairs: Triangular resection; Placement of one PTFE chord; Placement of two PTFE chords. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The principal findings of this study are the following: 1) Placement of prosthetic chordae resulted in stable or decreased overall posterior leaflet stress for all phases of the cardiac cycle; 2) In contrast, triangular resection resulted in increased posterior leaflet stress, most prominently in diastole; 3) All repair techniques reduced stress on the anterior leaflet; 4) All repair techniques restored normal leaflet coaptation. An example of pre- and post-repair leaflet geometry is shown in the attached figure, for placement of two prosthetic chordae. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: All repair techniques eliminated mitral regurgitation and restored normal leaflet coaptation. Finite element analysis revealed that mitral valve repair with prosthetic chordae restored normal leaflet geometry without creation of excessive stress on the valvular tissues, in contrast to leaflet resection, which significantly increased stress across the posterior leaflet. Future studies will examine this effect across a broad range of patients with the aim of developing a patient-specific tool for mitral valve repair preoperative planning and surgical education.","Basic Science","Cardiovascular Biology/Physiology","Cardiothoracic"

The literature has demonstrated that video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) techniques have improved patient recovery time with fewer postoperative complications, and sustained long-term survivorship data equivalent to open thoracotomy for early stage lung cancer.  However, the additional benefit of robotic video-assisted thoracic surgery (RVATS) remains controversial.  As a prelude to a prospective trial comparing RVATS with conventional VATS for lobectomy, we conducted a retrospective review of all RVATS cases at an academic, tertiary referral center with a focus on lobectomy cases.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A review was conducted of 101 consecutive patients undergoing robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery between August 2005 and May 2015.  Outcomes data collected include operative time, blood loss, duration of hospital and postoperative ICU stay, chest tube duration, conversion rates, and perioperative morbidity and mortality.  In addition, a subset cost analysis compared direct costs and medical supply expenses for 10 lobectomy cases, each performed by RVATS, VATS, and thoracotomy.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  In this initial case series of 41 cases of RVATS lobectomy, patients had a median hospital length of stay of 4 days, ICU length of stay of 0 days, chest tube duration of 2 days, and an average blood loss of 151 mL.  One patient (2.4%) that was electively converted to thoracotomy for a large upper and middle lobe tumor, died from pneumonia and respiratory failure. There were 6 (14.6%) cases converted to open thoracotomy.  Direct costs for lobectomies performed by VATS, RVATS and thoracotomy were $23,306, $25,510 and $35,195, respectively.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Progressive incorporation of the surgical robot in an already advanced thoracoscopic program is feasible.  The immediate postoperative outcomes after RVATS lobectomy are similar to what has been reported from our institution and others for VATS lobectomy.  RVATS was modestly more expensive than VATS, but both were significantly cheaper than thoracotomy.  A prospective comparison of RVATS and VATS would provide greater understanding of the precise benefits or lack thereof of the Da Vinci surgical robotic system for minimally invasive lung resections.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Cardiothoracic"

Primary outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 14 studies were included in this study. Intensive glucose control significantly reduced mortality (relative risk (RR) = 0.742, 95% CI=0.566 to 0.973; p=0.031) and ICU LOS (Standardized difference of mean (SDM) = -0.352, 95% CI=-0.352 to -0.692; p=0.042) but did not influence overall hospital LOS (SDM= -0.255, 95% CI = -0.722 to 0.211; p=0.283). Significant secondary outcomes were overall infection (RR=0.444, 95% CI=0.322 to 0.611; p&lt;0.001) and atrial fibrillation rates (RR=0.722, 95% CI=0.582 to 0.896; p=0.003). No difference in stroke (RR=2.279, 95% CI=0.525 to 9.885; p=0.271), deep sternal infection (RR=0.599, 95% CI=0.242 to 1.484; p=0.268), acute renal failure (RR=1.337, 95% CI=0.468 to 3.821; p=0.588), or prolonged intubation rates were observed (RR=0.990, 95% CI=0.661 to 1.483; p=0.962).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Optimal glycemic control is significantly linked to improved perioperative outcomes in cardiac surgery patients. Intensive glucose control (&lt; 120 mg/dl) reduces mortality and ICU LOS in cardiac surgery patients, while also decreasing overall postoperative infection and atrial fibrillation rates compared to more liberal glycemic strategies. Additional adequately powered studies are needed to further investigate the nuances of optimal intensity and duration of glycemic control in this patient population.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Cardiothoracic"

Thus an increasing number of patients with suspected mesothelioma call to inquire about specialized, multi-modality care.  Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare disease affecting approximately 3000 Americans annually. A disproportionate amount of new patients are veterans, accounting for an estimated 1/3. The majority have distant history of asbestos exposure during military service. A latency period of decades is common, and the disease is difficult to diagnose.   The treatment options include supportive care, chemotherapy and maximal cytoreductive surgery. Guidelines support multidisciplinary care, with evaluation by surgeons with expertise treating MPM.    <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In 2011 we began to offer open access phone triage to Veterans with newly diagnosed MPM by a general thoracic surgeon and a member of the International Mesothelioma Program (IMP), VABHS. The patients were referred by primary care providers, oncologists, surgeons, veteran advocates or self-referred using online media.  A total of 69 patients were triaged world-wide.  Further documentation was requested and analyzed including records, diagnostics labs, radiology tests and pathology slides from an initial biopsy.  Patients that were reasonable candidates for cytoreductive surgery were encouraged to travel to the WXVA for further assessment. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Out of 69 callers, 57 were Veterans, and we encouraged 46 to be seen by a surgeon with expertise in the field. 32 veterans were surgically staged at VABHS.  13 of these patients eventually underwent definitive surgery at VABHS, while 16 patients transferred their care to another hospital.  9 veterans opted out of surgery or had a contraindication to surgery.    All service branches were represented for veterans with mesothelioma: Army (13), Navy (23), USMC (4), Coast Guard (2), Air Force (4) and unknown (11)<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Open access Phone triage for veterans with findings suspicious of MPM, by a surgeon with expertise in the treating MPM, provides guideline supported care for patients across the nation.

Consensus is lacking among surgeons regarding closure of the esophageal muscle layer following resection of an esophageal duplication cyst and long-term outcomes are poorly documented.  Therefore, we sought to determine whether closure of the esophageal muscle layer following resection influences short or long-term outcomes. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective cohort study performed at three institutions affiliated with childrens hospitals was performed.  Patients undergoing resection of esophageal duplication cysts between 1990-2012 were classified according to whether the esophageal muscle layer was closed or left open.  Demographic data, surgical technique, pre-operative symptoms and both short-term (&lt; 30 days) and long-term (&ge; 30 days) complication rates were abstracted from patient medical records. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-five patients were identified with a median age of 15 years old (range: 2 months to 68 years old). Eleven patients had the esophageal muscle layer closed after surgical resection (44%). Of those 11 patients, one developed a short-term complication, dysphagia (9%, 95% CI: 2%, 38%).  Only one patient returned to the operating room, after 30 days, for an upper endoscopy after developing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease.  Of the 14 patients who had their muscle layer left open, 3 patients (21%, 95% CI: 8%, 48%) developed short-term complications, 2 of whom required surgical intervention within 30 days. Furthermore, 2 additional patients required surgical intervention after 30 days for a long-term complication (diverticulum and cyst recurrence). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Surgical complications occurred more frequently in patients who had the muscle layer left open after resection of an esophageal duplication cyst. Additionally, the majority of patients requiring re-operation for both short-term and long-term complications occurred in this group. Though small, this study is the first to evaluate the complications after resecting esophageal duplication cysts.  Our results suggest that closing the esophageal muscle layer following removal of an esophageal duplication cyst may be indicated to prevent both complications and the need for reoperations.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate national and local trends in applications to surgical residency after implementation of the 80-hour workweek.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  NRMP Results and Data from the Main Residency Match between 1999 and 2014 were interrogated for the number of applicants, available general surgery positions, and ranks per available positions.  Data from an academic program (California) and an independent program (Wisconsin) was also collected for available years, 2007 to 2014.  Data was statistically analyzed using linear regression (SPSS V22).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Nationally, the number of unfilled residency positions decreased from an average of 44.7 prior to 2003 to 4.1 after 2003, (p= 0.04).

To alleviate concerns regarding maintenance of clinical skill during the research years, some residents take extra call shifts or moonlight to offset potential skill reduction. Several research studies have characterized lab resident experiences during moonlighting. However, few have investigated how residents' surgical performance is impacted by moonlighting. The aim of this paper was to determine if the effects of moonlighting can be objectively measured during assessments of surgical skill. Our hypothesis is that the quality and accuracy (errors) of resident performance in a simulated laparoscopic ventral hernia (LVH) would be positively correlated with moonlighting experience.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Thirty-eight surgical lab residents (PGY2-4; 54% female) had 15 minutes to complete two steps of a simulated LVH procedure including securing mesh anchoring sutures to the abdominal wall and affixing the mesh with a laparoscopic tacker. Residents identified how often they take clinical shifts in a pre-simulation general survey. Resident performance was determined by analyzing the hernia skins and errors made during the procedure. Post-simulation, hernia skins were graded on a 24-point scale for quality of repair. Procedural errors were identified using a checklist of previously identified common errors committed during the LVH procedure. Based on their moonlighting activity, residents were grouped into low or high moonlighting groups based on whether they reported one or fewer clinical shifts per month (n=22) or two or more shifts (n=16). A logistic regression analysis was used to predict frequency of moonlighting in lab residents using errors and final hernia grades as predictors.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The logistic regression analysis using repair quality and error scores as predictors reliably distinguished between the two moonlighting groups (&chi;<sup>2</sup> = 7.78, p=.02). The model explained 25.1% (Nagelkerke's R<sup>2</sup>) of the between-group variance in predictor scores and correctly classified 73.7% of residents into their respective moonlighting group. Residents' hernia quality repair scores (p=.021) made a significant contribution to the prediction. Errors did not. Residents in the high moonlighting group had better repair quality scores on average (M=16.5, SD=5.0) than the low moonlighting group (M=14.2, SD=5.2). There was no significant difference in the frequency of errors committed between the two groups (p =.61).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Residents who reported moonlighting had higher quality hernia repair scores compared to those who rarely if ever moonlighted. However there were no differences in the number of errors made between groups. These findings suggest that there is either a qualitative difference in the types of errors made by residents who moonlight or that they are better able to identify and manage errors when they occur, thereby not affecting repair quality.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

These data were compared to resident performance which was defined by attending evaluations using the ACGME competency based milestones and standardized test scores (USMLE and ABSITE).  Statistical comparison was made using Pearson correlation for continuous variables and ANOVA for categorical variables.  The association between milestone scores and global trait EI was also evaluated using a general linear model to adjust for evaluation differences by post-graduate year (PGY).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall survey response rate was 68.9%.  Global EI did not significantly vary by resident age, gender, marital status, or PGY.  Global EI was associated with scores on USMLE Step 2 (r=0.46; p=0.01) and Step 3 (r=0.54; p=0.01) but not ABSITE percentile scores (r=0.06, p=0.77).  Clinical milestone scores significantly increased by PGY status (p&lt;0.01), but were not associated with Global EI before or after adjustment for PGY (p&gt;0.05).

Yet, surgical curriculum applying quality improvement methodology remains largely undefined.  Our residency program incorporates a research-based curriculum for categorical interns with foundational instruction in QI methodology. To expand the curriculum and develop systems-based application of QI methodology, we hypothesized that selection of a clinical problem, first-case delays (FCD) in the OR, would provide QI instruction from an interdisciplinary perspective while addressing educational goals.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   After instruction in fundamentals of research, IRB approval was obtained.  Resident identification of FCD for the interdisciplinary study was guided by experienced faculty.  Literature searches were used to develop data dictionaries of standardized reasons for case delay.  The data dictionary was used for direct observation of patient and team-based readiness for in room start at 715 AM.  Cases observed were General or Vascular Surgery cases in which residents were involved.  Using QI methodology, Pareto analysis was performed to stratify reasons for delay and was compared to computer-recorded staff entries of reasons for delay.  Analytical drill-down using Ishikawa diagrams further stratified contributing factors for case delays, providing additional opportunities to expand QI initiatives.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  A total of 27 first case starts were observed, of which 25 (92.6%) failed to start on time.  Pareto analysis determined the most common reason for delay to be failure of OR room readiness (56%, n=14) followed by near equivalent delays for transport, patient availability, anesthesiology, or surgical reasons. By contrast, computer recorded entries listed surgical team readiness as the primary cause of delay indicating that efforts to address delays could be impaired if not targeted appropriately.  Ishikawa diagrams (Figure) demonstrate the complexity of interdisciplinary team function required to prevent FCD while enhancing understanding of how to address delays.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Using clinical issues to apply QI methodology expands resident education in the science of quality improvement and interdisciplinary teamwork while broadening the resident's understanding of the healthcare system.  Ongoing collaboration of teams using QI methodology can be used to prevent first-case delays and improve teamwork in the OR.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

To expand the resident education experience and allow for senior residents to be more autonomous in the management of patients both in the operating room and perioperatively, our program implemented a new Resident-run Acute Care Surgery (RACS) consult service. We hypothesized that creation of this service would increase TA cases and resident satisfaction, as well as be more efficient in evaluating consults.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: With the implementation of RACS, we switched from an attending-service based call model to a new admitting service that was mainly resident run with alternating attending supervision. Two residents (PGY4 or 5 and PGY2) staffed this service and all new surgical consults were directed to RACS. When appropriate based on resident experience and case complexity, the operative case was done as a TA case with the senior resident taking the junior resident through the case and the attending in the room. We collected information on TA case logs for senior residents pre (n=10) and post (n=11) implementation of the RACS service, independency data on the proportion of each case performed independently by residents, resident evaluations of general surgery services, and consult time (time from consultation to time patient seen) for the first 12 months of the service (June 2014-June 2015).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The number of total TA cases logged among graduating chief residents increased from a mean of 13.4 &plusmn; 13.0 (range 4-44) for pre-RACS residents to 30.8 &plusmn; 8.8 (range 27-36) for post-RACS residents (p&lt;0.01). This increase was seen with a mean of one month spent on RACS for the post-RACS residents. Of 323 operative cases, the residents performed an average of 82% of the case independently. On resident service evaluations of RACS (n=27) compared to other general surgery services (n=127), there was a significant increase in the satisfaction with the variety of cases (mean 5.08 vs 4.52, p&lt;0.01 on a 1-6 Likert scale) and complexity of cases (mean 5.35 vs 4.94, p&lt;0.01). In addition, creation of a one-team consult service resulted in a more streamlined consult process, with average consult time of 22min for operative consults and 25min for non-operative consults.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The implementation of a RACS service has increased resident autonomy, TA cases, and satisfaction with operative case variety, as well as increased the efficiency of surgical consultation at our institution.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Lerner<sup>1</sup>, M. Nussbaum<sup>1</sup>, J. Tepas<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Florida College Of Medicine,Surgery,JACKSONVILLE, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The shift from Fee- For-Service (FFS) to value and quality based payment has stimulated multiple alternative payment models (APM) that include the Medicare 'Shared Savings Program (SSP),' 'Pay for Performance (P4P),' 'Comprehensive Care Payments (CCP),' and 'Episode of Care/Bundled Payment (EOC/BP)'.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has declared its goal to tie 30% of Medicare payments to alternative payment models by the end of 2016, and 50% by the end of 2018. Recently enacted legislation repealing the sustainable growth rate (SGR) intends to shift to &gt;75% of reimbursement to APM.  Little is currently known about the perception of this among General Surgery residents, who will inherit a system in flux upon completion of their training.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An electronic survey was distributed to American General Surgery residents to assess their understanding and perception of these alternative models. Using Likert scale responses, surgical autonomy, patient satisfaction, coordination of care, control of costs, and surgical outcomes were evaluated with respect to these reimbursement models. Model types were compared by level of understanding and perception of impact on key areas of surgical practice.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:255 surveys were distributed individually via program coordinators, and one link was distributed via the Association of Program Directors in Surgery list-serve, yielding a return of 183 responses. FFS and P4P were best known, with &gt;75% of respondents reporting at least moderate familiarity. BP/EOC was at least moderately familiar to 62% of respondents. Conversely, 63.2% indicated limited familiarity with CAP. 60.2% were slightly or not at all familiar with CCP. 71% were either slightly or not at all familiar with SSP. Analysis of impact on surgical practice demonstrated consensus regarding anticipated effect on surgical autonomy and cost control (table). None of the models were seen as improving patient satisfaction. P4P was anticipated to improve outcome by 47.2% of respondents. A need for more education about the new healthcare reimbursement models was indicated by 95.1% of respondents.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Most residents have limited familiarity with FFS, P4P and BP/EOC. Most also recognized the trade-off between surgical autonomy and cost control. Only FFS was perceived to have a positive effect on autonomy, while all alternative models had a perceived negative effect. Only P4P was perceived to have a positive impact on surgical outcomes by a majority of respondents. An overwhelming majority articulated need for more education in this area and a role in developing and evaluating these alternative models.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Pugh<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Wisconsin,Madison, WI, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The operating room (OR) has traditionally been a place of discovery learning. However, prior reports have shown that residents spend less than 15% of their total residency hours in the OR. Furthermore, use and development of new surgical devices and technologies limits residents' participation in certain procedures as part of their general training. As such, the OR must increasingly become a place of active, focused learning with each experience. Effective communication should occur prior to the operation to identify learning needs. The goal of this study was to investigate pre-operative communication between attendings and residents.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Categorical surgery residents (n=20) completed a 39-item survey assessing the following related to operative preparation: 1) when they prepare and the amount of time they spend preparing, 2) what they focus on when preparing, 3) interaction with attendings before the operative case 4) resource use to prepare for the operation and 5) identification of perceived case weaknesses. A 5 point Likert scale was used, with 1= Hardly Ever and 5= Almost Always. In the sample, there were 12 males (60%), and the average age was 32. The majority of the residents (6) were in their program year (PGY) 1, with 4 in both PGY 2 and PGY 3, and 3 in both PGY4 and PGY5.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: All of the respondents (see Table 1) said that they usually prepare for operative cases. The majority of residents identify the critical steps of an operation prior to the case. Only a small percentage, however, review these with the attending with regularity, and 95% state they do not typically discuss who will perform these critical steps. Fourteen residents (70%) stated that discussion of personal educational goals prior to cases occurs infrequently. The majority of residents typically do not discuss what parts of the case they will do with the attending beforehand (85%). That being said, most residents reported hardly ever asking to do a certain part prior to operating and stated that weakness identification pre-operatively does not generally occur. Finally, only 30% of residents were largely satisfied with the amount of interaction with attendings prior to cases.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We have identified major deficits in communication between residents and attendings. Explicit communication is therefore needed to improve teaching and learning within the OR. Though patient centric, the OR is also a learning environment for surgical residents. Overall, residents would like more opportunities for pre-operative discussions with attendings. Potential targets for these discussions include residents' case participation and personal educational goals.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

On the other hand, full-text publication of abstracts in peer-reviewed journals provides dissemination of knowledge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the publication rate of abstracts presented at the 2009 American Transplant Congress (ATC), and the annual Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (AHPBA) from 2007-2009 to assess the factors influencing publication and determine the impact factor of these journals.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All abstracts presented at the 2009 ATC and 2007-2009 ABPBA were included in the study. A Pubmed-Medline search was performed to identify a matching journal article. Topics, country of origin, study type, study center and publication year were tabulated. Journals and impact factors of publication were noted.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of 2568 abstracts presented, (474)18% were published as full-text articles. Publication rates according to topics of the meeting and country of origin did demonstrate statistical significant differences (p-value&lt;0.05). Single-centered studies had higher publication rates 70.87% (160/190) than multi-centered studies among oral abstracts. Abstracts from multi-centered studies had higher publication rates among poster abstracts (68.09% vs. 31.91%), and the journals they were published in had higher impact factors than single center studies (4.578 vs. 3.897). The median impact factor of the journals was 4.2 (4.8 for oral presentations and 3.627 for poster presentations) that went on to be published as full text manuscripts. When comparing multi-center and single institutions, the difference between 12 month and 24 month publication rates was not statistically significant (p=0.5443 and 0.1134). However, oral and poster abstracts published by study center (multi/single) did demonstrate a statistically significant difference (p &lt; .0001); comparing the type of study, there was also a statistically significant difference between the oral and poster abstract (p &lt; .0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Eighteen percent of abstracts presented at both meetings went on to full text publication. The publication rate for these abstracts presented at both meetings was lower than rates from other fields of medicine. Factors leading to failure require elucidation. Encouraging authors to submit their presentations for full-text publication might improve the rate of publication.  Authors should be wary of accepting oral and poster abstracts as dogma; authors should refrain from citing them in publications especially if they are from outside United States.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Ganai<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Southern Illinois University School Of Medicine,Springfield, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Resident case volume and complement has changed over the past decade, possibly due to an increase in minimally-invasive procedures and duty hour reform. Subspecialty fellowship training in complex general surgical oncology has recently received approval for board certification and has been advocated as a pathway to improve proficiency in the performance of complex open oncologic cases in addition to providing comprehensive exposure to the multidisciplinary management of cancer. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate trends in resident exposure to complex oncologic cases.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective analysis of National Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) case log statistical reports from 2000-2013 was conducted to determine resident case volume for selected oncology-relevant procedures. Average yearly case numbers combining both Surgeon Chief and Surgeon Junior categories were analyzed as cases per graduating resident using linear regression assessing for temporal trends, with the null hypothesis assuming an estimated slope of zero. The Spearman rho test was used to estimate correlation of case trends over time.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Linear regression trends for oncology-relevant procedures are summarized in the attached table. Decreasing trends were observed for major lymphadenectomies (rho -0.93, p&lt;0.0001) and modified radical mastectomy (rho -0.86, p=0.007) during the study period. There was no significant change in exposure to total gastrectomy (rho +0.33, p=0.43) and esophagectomy (rho -0.60, p=0.03). An increasing exposure was noted for hepatopancreaticobiliary cases including major hepatic resection (rho +0.93, p &lt;0.0001) and pancreatectomy (rho +0.93, p &lt;0.0001). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:While decreases were noted for exposure to soft tissue lymphadenectomy, there were no differences in foregut cases and an increase in hepatopancreaticobiliary cases. The overall case numbers for several of these complex oncologic procedures remain low, justifying a need for further fellowship training depending on independent resident experience.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

We used pancreaticoduodenectomy as a model procedure to catalogue the variability between surgeons within an affiliated health system and investigate the factors that affect fellow's acquisition of techniques.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Semi-structured interviews and operative note analysis were conducted to determine techniques of five attending surgeons, and these data were mapped to identify variations. Identical interviews and subsequent questioning were completed with four recent fellowship graduates whose current practice included pancreaticoduodenectomy.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:All surgeons performed a different operation, both in order and techniques employed. Based on minor variations, there were actually 21 surgical step data points that differed &ndash; far more than previously recognized. Four of five surgeons were unable to identify colleagues' techniques.  Fellows reported that they were more likely to adopt techniques from mentors who had regimented techniques, teaching styles they related to, and with whom they frequently operated. Fellows did not feel residency training had a strong influence on their choice of technique, but did report a moderate influence from senior partners after fellowship.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The true number of variants of pancreaticoduodenectomy based on granular, step-by-step difference is substantially larger than previously described.  Results hint that variation may be furthered by the fact that surgeons may not be intimately aware of the techniques employed by colleagues.  Interestingly, fellows appear to choose techniques based on factors not directly related to their own outcomes, but rather mentors' techniques and teaching style. Whether fellows adopt the techniques that will be most optimal given their abilities is worthy of further investigation, as are changes in technique over time. Better codification of surgical variation is needed to facilitate these investigations as well as matching of technical variations to patient outcomes.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

The global burden of noncommunicable diseases and injury requiring surgical care has overtaken that of infectious disease, with conditions such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes, increasing dramatically in less-developed countries. Evidence suggest that barriers to accessing surgical care in low- and middle-income countries include difficulty accessing surgical services due to distance, poor roads, and lack of suitable transport; lack of local resources and expertise; and direct and indirect costs related to surgical care. What is less clear is what elements are responsible for influencing medical students in choosing a career in surgery.  The goal of this study is to elucidate the reasons why medical students may or may not choose a career in surgery, identify common themes across different regions, genders and income strata.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  In collaboration with the University of Oxford, we developed an electronic, multi-question survey to help elucidate the reasons why medical students may choose or discount surgical careers. Hosted on a web-based survey platform via the University of Oxford, the survey was distributed via multiple mailing lists as well as social media. The study was open to all medical students and was entirely anonymous and confidential. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 499 medical students from 63 countries in six different regions including Africa, Asia, The Americas, Australasia, Eastern Mediterranean and Europe completed the survey (n=499), 43% (216) of which were male. 68%(339) of responders are considering a surgical career comprising 83% (192) female and 68% (147) male responders. Responses were analyzed both collectively and by region. Those from the East Mediterranean region were the most likely to be considering a career in surgery (81%) while those from Europe and Australasia was the least likely (67%). With the exception of Australasia, all regions disagreed with the statement that medical students had good access to undergraduate surgical education. The cost of postgraduate surgical training was expressed as a significant concern only in the African region. Over half the responders from Asia, Africa and the East Mediterranean agreed that surgeons in their countries dedicated the majority of their time to private sector patients. These regions were also the most likely to say that surgeons had poor access to resources. All regions except for Europe perceived surgeons to be overworked.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While the study is not yet adequately powered, trends in elements influencing medical students to choose a surgical career are appearing within our preliminary data. Whilst applications from female surgeons remain low in different regions globally, enthusiasm amongst female medical students appears to be high. Barriers to female students having successful surgical careers may therefore be more influential after completion of medical school.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Virtual reality simulation (VRS) is a well-established means of endovascular skills training, and other simulation skills are now mandatory for board-eligibility in general surgery. Training for emerging endovascular damage control skills in trauma, including resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA), may be obtained by residents through VRS.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Fifteen trainees in either an ACGME-approved General Surgery or Surgical Critical Care Fellowship at one institution received didactic and instructional sessions on REBOA. The subjects performed the procedure 6 times. Subjects were excluded if they had taken a similar endovascular training course, had post-graduate training in endovascular surgery, or had performed the procedure in the clinical setting. Performance metrics were measured on a Likert scale, and included procedural time; accurate placement of guide wire, sheath, and balloon; correct sequence of steps; economy of motion; and safe use of endovascular tools. A pre- and post-course test and questionnaire were completed by each subject.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Fifteen subjects, with a mean PGY level of 4.9 years (SD&plusmn;0.95) participated in the study. Significant improvements in knowledge (p &lt; 0.0001, CI 95%), as assessed by a standardized exam, were observed at the completion of the course.

No correlation was observed with endovascular experience in residency, number of endoluminal catheters placed per week, or other parameters. All trainees strongly agreed that the course was beneficial, and the majority would recommend this training to other trainees.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Damage control endovascular skills can be effectively acquired using VRS. Significant improvements in procedural time and knowledge can be achieved regardless of previous endovascular experience or area of training. Novice interventionalists such as surgical trainees can add a specific skill set (REBOA) to their existing core competencies. Use of this procedure in the clinical setting will determine if VRS for REBOA training confers validation metrics such as transfer of skills.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

An additional question asked residents for their PGY year. At the close of the survey residents were given the opportunity to anonymously comment and extrapolate their experience.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Forty-seven out of our 60 residents (78.3% responder rate) completed the survey. Sixty-six percent of residents reported at least one instance in which they faced a moral objection to an attending's decision to operate (or refuse to operate) on a patient, while 48% reported taking part in intra-operative decision making that they felt clearly deviated from appropriate care. Sixty-one percent of residents said they felt comfortable raising concerns with an attending decision on moral or ethical grounds, however only 27% of residents felt assured that this would not result in any form of retaliation. Sixty-one percent of residents felt that at least half of their attending would be receptive to a resident voicing their patient-care decisions or moral or ethical grounds. A majority of residents (71%) felt that a senior resident was the most appropriate person to consult when they didn't feel comfortable voicing their concerns with a particular attending.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Surgical residency training can challenge residents with difficult decision-making regarding patient care on both moral and ethical grounds.

This study aimed to investigate an approach to the learning curve as an academic institution starts a high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) practice. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Following IRB approval, a total of 161 HRAs performed on 103 patients by two surgeons over two years at an academic institution were retrospectively reviewed. The two colorectal surgeons had completed the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) approved colposcopy and HRA course.  Anal pap smears were obtained concurrently with each HRA performed and the concordance of HRA and Pap smear was examined, based on both volume and duration of practice.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The mean age was 45.5 years (range 23-79) and 70 (68.0%) patients were male. Seventy-eight percent (80/103) of the patients were HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)-positive and 11% (11/103) of the patients had CD4 counts less than 200.  Fifty-three percent of all HRAs performed were positive for anal dysplasia in the presence of abnormal anal cytology. The concordance of anal cytology and HRA improved as case volume increased (from 60% to 67% for surgeon 1 [p=0.24], and from 70% to 75% for surgeon 2 [p=0.72]) (Fig-1-A). Similar results were seen after evaluating the learning curve based on the duration of practice (from 56% to 64% for surgeon 1 [p=0.37], and from 71% to 75% for surgeon 2 [p=0.97]) (Fig-1-B). Interestingly, the changes in concordance were not consistent over time for surgeon 1, who had a peak of 70% vs. a nadir of 35%. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Although both surgeons demonstrated a non-statistically significant improvement in HRA-cytology concordance over time, the unusual learning curve pattern for surgeon 1 may hint to some challenges that might have impacted the learning curve, including lack of a gold standard for which to compare HRA results and multiple patient-related factors. In order to better evaluate the learning curve, we need to consider all these limitations and be able to control all the potential patient related factors that may impact the surgeon's performance.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Of these, 11 patients had a component of MD/Mix-IPMN. Carcinoma was found in 5/11(45%) patients and the following were the details. Invasive carcinoma was found in 4/11(36%) patients and high grade dysplasia in 3/11(27%) patients. We present a case report with noninvasive carcinoma which grew 3mm to 8mm of main pancreatic duct with 16mm cyst at the pancreatic head for one year. Of these, 4 patients had a component of BD-IPMN. Invasive carcinoma was found in only one case with high risk stigmata of jaundice. Our previous study from Jan 2006 to Mar 2013 revealed that invasive carcinoma was found in 6/24(25%) patients and high grade dysplasia in 7/24(29%) patients with MD/Mix-IPMN. While, invasive carcinoma was found in 3/29(10%) patients and high grade dysplasia was found in 5/29(17%) patients with BD-IPMN. Next we investigated 37 patients who were continuously observed. 12 patients of these had a component of MD/Mix-IPMN including 2 cases with high-risk stigmata and 10 cases with worrisome features. The other 25 patients had a component of BD-IPMN including 7 cases with worrisome features.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of low vitamin D on the extent of resection and post-operative hypocalcemia for patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary HPT.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified patients with primary HPT undergoing parathyroid surgery between 2000 and 2015 using a prospectively maintained database. Patients with normal (30ng/mL or greater) vitamin D (25-OH) levels were compared to those with levels less than 30ng/mL.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The study included 1015 (54%) patients with normal vitamin D and 872 (46%) patients with low vitamin D undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary HPT. Lower vitamin D was associated with higher preoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) compared to normal vitamin D (median 90 vs 77pg/mL, p&lt;.001). Calcium (median 10.5 vs 10.4mg/dL, p&lt;.001) was also higher while phosphate (median 2.8 vs 2.9mg/dL, p&lt;.001) was lower in patients with low vitamin D, indicating more severe disease. Despite higher preoperative and baseline PTH levels in the low vitamin D group, 10 and 15 minute post-excision PTH was similar (Figure) resulting in a greater overall drop in PTH (median drop 78 vs 72%, p&lt;.001) and similar post-operative calcium (median 9.3 vs 9.3mg/dL, p=.13) compared with the normal vitamin D group. A subgroup analysis in patients with severely low (&le;10ng/mL) vitamin D (n=67) also revealed higher preoperative PTH, similar post-excision PTH, greater drop in PTH (median drop 81 vs 72%, p&lt;.001), and similar post-operative calcium (median 9.3 vs 9.3, p=.39) compared to those with normal vitamin D. To achieve similar cure rates, patients with low vitamin D were less likely to require 4-gland exploration (19 vs 23%, p=.009), conversion from a focused approach to 4-gland exploration (11 vs 15%, p=.01), removal of more than 1 gland (20 vs 30%, p&lt;.001), and subtotal parathyroidectomy (8 vs 12%, p=.003) than patients with normal vitamin D. Despite undergoing a more focused operation, patients with low vitamin D had similar rates of persistent (1.5 vs 2.0%, p=.43) and recurrent (1.7 vs 2.6%, p=.21) HPT. Also, at the time of parathyroidectomy both groups had equally low rates of both transient (2.3 vs 2.3%, p=.97) and permanent (0.2 vs 0.4%, p=.52) hypocalcemia.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Restoring vitamin D in deficient patients should not delay the appropriate surgical treatment of primary HPT. Even though low vitamin D may be a marker for more severe primary HPT, deficient patients are more likely to be cured with the excision of a single adenoma and no more likely to suffer persistence, recurrence, or hypocalcemia than patients with normal vitamin D.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

However, insufficient PTH drop within 10 minutes is noted in a number of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential factors affecting the time period in which a fifty percent PTH drop is observed. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients included in this study were those who underwent MIP by a single surgeon between between December 2011 and April 2015 with a single parathyroid gland removed and by definition whose PTH values eventually dropped by 50% and to within normal range.  This data was collected under IRB protocol after patient consent in a prospective clinical outcomes database. Patients were then grouped as follows: 1) 50% PTH drop at 10 min after gland excision 2) 50% drop at 15 min 3) 50% drop greater than 15 min. These groups were compared according to pre-operative PTH and calcium, age, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and weight of adenoma. Statistical analysis was performed by Oneway Anova. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 88 patients fit the selection criteria. There were 62 (70%) patients that experienced a PTH drop at ten minutes; 18 (20%) patients with PTH drop at 15 minutes; and 9 (10%) patients with PTH drop greater than 15 minutes.  Of the factors analyzed, statistical significance was only shown in the postoperative PTH values (p=0.001). However, patients with a 50% PTH drop at ten minutes displayed a higher mean GFR than the other groups. This difference approached statistical significance (p=0.0783). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Factors such as age, pre-operative PTH and calcium have no significant effect on the time required for a patients PTH to drop by 50%, indicating a successful operation. Because GFR was near statistical significance, it is plausible to consider GFR levels in deciding how long a surgeon should wait intra-operatively to draw PTH levels. Although postoperative PTH was shown to be statistically significant between the groups, there is very little use for this in recommendations for clinical protocol. Future study should involve a larger patient size in order to provide a more accurate assessment of factors that could cause this difference, if any.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Total thyroidectomy is the common treatment for FVPTC. However, recent studies suggest that the encapsulated form of FVPTC (eFVPTC), a subtype reported to behave more like a benign lesion, can be treated with thyroid lobectomy alone. The objective of this study was to determine if the eFVPTC behaves less aggressively than the non-encapsulated variant.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A prospectively collected endocrine surgery database was reviewed for all patients with either type of FVPTC on surgical pathology between 1999-2012. Histology was re-reviewed by a pathologist to determine if the FVPTC was encapsulated (eFVPTC) versus non-encapsulated (FVPTC).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the 68 patients with FVPTC, 27(40%) had eFVPTC while the remaining 41(60%) had FVPTC.  The mean age was 48 &plusmn; 1.8 years and 63% were female. Sixty-four (94%) underwent total thyroidectomy while the remaining patients had thyroid lobectomy alone. Fifty-four (84%) patients who had a total thyroidectomy received radioactive iodine. In comparing the groups, eFVPTC was more common in females than in males (49% vs. 24%, p=0.043). Five (7%) patients had cervical lymph node (LN) involvement, and the mean age of those patients was 34 &plusmn; 2.3 years compared with the patients without (vs 49.9 &plusmn; 6.8, p &lt; 0.0001).

It is more common in women in the fifth decade (incidence: 1 in 75). 95% of patients are symptomatic, with the most common symptoms being neuro-psychiatric in nature. Surgery is the gold standard for the management of PHPT. We propose the use of a radio-guided parathyroidectomy with a bilateral neck exploration, biopsy of the 4 parathyroid glands in-vivo, and the evaluation of their functionality ex-vivo in order to determine which should be excised. We describe the feasibility and efficacy of this technique at our hospital in Mexico City.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We present a retrospective observational study from a prospectively maintained cohort of 36 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of PHPT who underwent surgical intervention at our institution by two surgeons. The diagnosis was confirmed with serum calcium, 25 OH vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The NIH criteria were used to determine surgical candidates. For the procedure, patients underwent a 99m-Tc sestamibi scan 1 to 2 hours prior to surgery, a bilateral neck exploration through a 2 to 2.5 cm incision in which the 4 parathyroid glands were identified was performed. A biopsy in-vivo was taken from each of the glands and their ex-vivo functionality was evaluated using a gamma probe. The radioactivity of each gland was compared to the basal count taken before the start of the procedure, the hyperfunctioning glands were excised. Additionally, intraoperative PTH was measured in accordance to the Miami criteria. Patients were followed-up clinically and biochemically at 1 week, 3 weeks, 8 weeks and 1 year postoperatively.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Symptomatic PHPT was diagnosed in 100% of the patients. The average serum calcium was 10.13+0.6 mg/dl, and PTH 93.82+43.45 ng/ml. 52.7% of our patients had a negative 99m-Tc sestamibi scan and 44.4% had a positive scan for a single adenoma. Pathology confirmed that 19.4% of patients had a single adenoma, 36.1% a double adenoma, 33.3% a triple adenoma, and 11.1% hyperplasia. Compared to the gamma probe basal counts in the neck, adenomas presented on average 71%, and hyperplasic glands 20% of the basal value. All patients had a decrease in serum calcium and PTH postoperatively. There was a failure rate (persistent or recurrent PHPT) of 5.5%, and no patient presented with significant associated complications.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The radio-guided bilateral neck exploration with evaluation of the functionality ex-vivo of the 4 parathyroid glands offers a similar cure rate to the traditional bilateral neck exploration and has a greater cure rate than unilateral parathyroidectomy, with a similar morbidity rate to the latter. We show that this as a safe and effective technique for the management of PHPT and is associated with reduced hospital costs. This technique offers excellent clinical and esthetic results and represents a feasible alternative to the traditional parathryoidectomy.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Surgical repair consists of esophagomyotomy, often in conjunction with a reflux-reducing procedure. Given the rarity of this surgery in the pediatric population, we sought to determine which surgical techniques and studies are being performed for the surgical treatment of pediatric achalasia.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Data of surgeon workup and technique preferences treating esophageal achalasia were collected as part of a comprehensive online-based survey sent to members of the International Pediatric Endosurgery Group (IPEG).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  The survey was completed by 191 surgeons. Of the 191 surgeons polled, 141 perform esophagomyotomies for achalasia.The number of procedures performed per surgeon were; 1-2 (15%); 3-5 (34%); 6-10 (28%); 11-20 (15%); &gt;20 (8%). The majority of responders approach the operation laparoscopically (90%) while robotic and open approaches were used with equal frequencies at 5% each. None of the surgeons employed peroral endoscopic myotomy. Work up prior to esophageal myotomy most frequently consisted of a diagnostic esophagram (94%) or manometry (73%). Only 60% required an EGD and few requested T cruzi studies.No preference between circumferential, isolated anterior, or anterior and lateral division of the phrenoesophageal ligament for mobilization of the esophagus was demonstrated. Placement of anchoring sutures between the crus and esophagus after myotomy were performed equally.  There was a predominant preference for hook cautery (68%) over harmonic shears (21%), ligasure (13%) and other devices (8%) for muscle division. Intraoperatively 57% had endoscopy and 50% had post operative esophagram prior to initiation of enteral feeding. Fundoplication accomplished by the Thal/Dor approach was performed most frequently (81%) followed by the Toupe (13%) and Nissen (3%). Five percent of patients did not obtain any type of fundoplication to prevent post operative GERD. Diet restrictons were provided in 76% of post-operative patients.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Given the relative infrequency of achalasia in the pediatric population, no established treatment protocol exists.

Common etiologies include orogastric (OG) tube placement, endotracheal intubation, and endoscopy. Mortality as high as 29% has been reported. Treatment over the last decade has leaned towards non-operative management with nil per os (NPO), total parenteral nutrition (TPN), antibiotics, and radiographic examination prior to the re-institution of oral feeds. To date, treatment duration for non-operative management has not been well studied, therefore neonates may experience unnecessarily prolonged periods of enteral feed disruption and antibiotic exposure. The purpose of this study was to review cases of esophageal perforation in neonates to assess the outcomes of non-operative management. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective chart review was performed of patients under one year of age with ICD-9 code 530.4 for esophageal perforation treated at our institution between the years of 2009 and 2015. Data collected included demographic information, etiology of perforation, treatment course, time to resumption of enteral feeds, length of antibiotic use, time to subsequent radiographic resolution, and mortality. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Twenty-nine patients met study criteria. The etiologies of perforation were orogastric tube placement (n=26) and esophageal dilation for stricture (n=1). Three patients with a primary surgical diagnosis (diaphragmatic hernia, esophageal atresia, non-accidental trauma) were analyzed separately. Of the 26 patients with a non-surgical etiology for esophageal perforation, the average post-conceptual age at time of diagnosis was 27 &plusmn; 3.3 weeks. All 26 patients were managed non-operatively for the esophageal perforation. All were kept NPO with TPN and were placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Enteral feeds were resumed after a median of 8 days [Interquartile Range (IQR): 7-11].  Median antibiotic duration was 7 days (IQR: 7-9.8), and the median time to follow-up esophagram was 7 days (IQR: 7-9.8). Twenty-five of 26 patients (96%) demonstrated radiological resolution of perforation on initial follow-up esophagram, with only one requiring a second study. Five patients expired during the study period, but no deaths were related to the diagnosis of esophageal perforation. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In this largest reported sample of neonates treated for esophageal perforation, non-operative treatment with NPO, TPN, antibiotics, and follow-up esophagram was successful. In addition, all but one neonate demonstrated radiographic resolution of perforation by the time of initial esophagram. This data suggests that further investigation of a shorter duration for non-operative management and time to contrast study may be warranted, thus reducing the morbidities associated with enteral feed interruption and antibiotic administration.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Males comprised over half of the cohort (57%). Overall, 6% of children did not have any VACTERL screening test. Eighty percent had 2 or more screening tests; only 3% of the sample had all 5 screening tests. Seventy-seven percent of children had an echocardiogram; 20% had a spinal radiograph; 57% had some type of spinal cord assessment (spinal US only, 30%; spinal MRI only, 14%; both spinal US and spinal MRI, 13%); and 77% had a renal US. In addition, limb (upper and/or lower) radiographs were performed in 16% of children (Table).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In this population-based study, we identified a low rate of VACTERL screening in patients with ARM, especially for vertebral anomalies. Under-screening for associated anomalies may lead to delayed diagnosis of significant anomalies that may require either medical or surgical intervention; thus improving screening rates could enhance care of children with these conditions.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

While studies have shown that extra-abdominal neuroblastoma (pelvic and thoracic) is associated with favorable biological and clinical characteristics, little has been published with regard to the management and outcomes of cervical neuroblastic tumors. Cervical neuroblastoma represents 2-4% of all neuroblastomas, and current practice is to resect as much tumor as possible without incurring injury to nearby vital structures. In this study we sought to determine the characteristics of these tumors and the effect that the extent of resection has on the overall survival and rate of complications in these patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review of 325 children who were identified to have a neuroblastic tumor at Children's Hospital Los Angeles over a 15-year period (1/1990&ndash;2/2015). Data collected from the medical record included location of tumor, age at diagnosis, age at resection, extent of resection, chemotherapy course, INSS stage, INPC histological classification, and MYCN amplification. Outcome variables included postoperative complications and overall survival. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Thirteen patients (13/325 - 4%) were identified to have cervical neuroblastic tumors (Table 1); 10 patients (77%) with neuroblastoma (NB), 1 patient with ganglioneuroblastoma (GNB)(7.7%), 2 patients with ganglioneuroma (GN)(15.4%). Median age at diagnosis was 5 months (range 1 mo-15 yrs). One 15 year old had high-risk stage 4 NB with unfavorable histology while the other 9 NB patients were infants &lt;12 months of age. The remaining 3 patients (18-66 mos of age) had differentiating pathology (GN, GNB). All but one had favorable histology and none had MYCN amplification. Six of 10 NB patients underwent resection (5 gross total resection (GTR) and 1 partial resection) while the other 4 underwent biopsy followed by chemotherapy or observation. After GTR, 1 NB patient required prolonged intubation necessitating tracheostomy and another developed eyelid ptosis. The GNB patient, also post-GTR, developed Horner syndrome. The 2 GN patients underwent GTR as well, which resulted in permanent injury to 5 cranial nerves and eyelid ptosis. At latest follow-up, there has been 1 death secondary to relapsed disease.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Cervical neuroblastic tumors represent favorable lesions with good outcomes similar to other extra-abdominal neuroblastic tumors. In our study, survival was excellent regardless of extent of tumor resection. Based on our data, with the high incidence of complications following GTR, we recommend a minimally agressive surgical approach in managing children with cervical neuroblastic tumors.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Little is known about pediatric surgical specialists' experience and attitude toward patients&#39; insurance deductibles or whether pediatric surgical specialists take their patients' out-of-pocket expenses into account when planning care. A national survey of pediatric surgical specialists was conducted to define the their experience with patient insurance concerns.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Members from the American Academy of Pediatrics Sections on Plastic Surgery, Surgery and Urology were asked to participate in an anonymous online survey to assess the relationship between surgeon experience with patients' insurance plans and resource utilization. A 6-item Likert-type scale was used to assess surgeon experience with patients' insurance concerns. A higher score on the scale associates with increased empathy and concern towards patients' insurance status. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate practice pattern differences.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Two hundred and eighteen out of 973 (21%) surgeons representing 38 states completed the survey. Almost half of the surveyed surgeons did not know if cost was a determinant for their patients' choice in surgical facility (43%), or if parents compared provider costs prior to the visit (50%). If the family brought up cost or insurance coverage as an issue, the majority of surgeons would consider cheaper diagnostic modalities (84%) and adjust surgery schedules to decrease patient deductibles (94%). The minority (34%) of surgeons never considered cost as a determinant when scheduling multistage operations. The 6-item Likert-type patient insurance experience scale score did not differ significantly among surgical subspecialties, practice sizes, practice types or states of practice. Surgeons who scored lower on this scale tended to recommend laboratory and radiologic testing at their own facility, citing test reliability and accessibility to results as the top reasons for this practice (p&lt;0.05). The majority of the surgeons surveyed (84%) would consider patient cost in their recommendation of a test or therapy if medically appropriate.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pediatric surgical specialists are currently unaware if out-of-pocket cost influences patients' preoperative decisions, but are sympathetic to the issue of out-of-pocket costs if families raised cost as an issue during their visit. As the financial burden of health care shifts to patients and families, the influence of this burden on health care choices by consumers and providers may affect both access to care and surgical outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Previous studies have shown that patients face many barriers when attempting to utilize e-Health including factors related to socioeconomic status, language, age, and education. We hypothesized that barriers exist that significantly impact a parent's ability to access and feel comfortable with using eHealth.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a cross-sectional study which included 24 non-randomly selected parents of 21 pediatric surgical patients.  After obtaining informed consent, semi-structured interviews were conducted in an outpatient clinic by one of two co-authors (AE and BF).  The interviews were conducted in each participant's primary language (11 English and 10 Spanish) and participants were asked about access to eHealth, mechanism(s) of use and challenges faced in accessing and using eHealth.  The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis.   English-speaking participants (ESP) and Spanish-speaking participants (SSP) were compared. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: All participants, except one SSP, had access to the Internet at home. Compared to SSP, ESP were more likely to use the Internet to learn about their own (73% vs 38%) or their child's health (80% vs 50%).  In both groups, parents who used eHealth were more likely to look up information regarding their child's health versus their own health.  ESP tended to use computers and cell phones, whereas SSP were more likely to use only tablets or cell phones.  Challenges to using eHealth for ESP included the vast amount of knowledge available, uncertainty of resource credibility and poor Internet connections. Among SSP, non-Spanish websites, inadequate access and lack of knowledge on how to use the Internet presented challenges to utilizing eHealth.  In both groups, most participants viewed the potential for email communication with their child's physician as positive (85%).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While most parents report access to the Internet, both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking parents face challenges in utilizing eHealth.  In this pilot project, we identified several key differences between ESP and SSP.  We will use our results to inform content in developing a survey to identify and characterize comfort level and barriers that might hinder a parent's ability to navigate eHealth.

We examine our current protocol regarding pediatric patients who present with febrile urinary tract infection, who underwent DMSA scans. Specifically, calculating the added cost when compared to a dedicated pediatric renal ultrasound and the radiation dose associated with each scan.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: DMSA renal scans are often utilized in the evaluation of pediatric patient present with febrile UTI.  Given the prevalence of these exams in pediatric urology practice; we sought to quantify the cost, radiation exposure, and relative clinical utility when compared to dedicated pediatric renal ultrasound (RUS) in our patient population.We conducted an IRB approved retrospective study of children referred to our institution for history of febrile UTIs between the years 2004-2013. Inclusion criteria: 1) children diagnosed with vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) via voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), 2) fever &gt; 380 C, 2) urine culture with single organism of &gt;50,000 cfu, and 3) patients who underwent both DMSA and RUS. Cost of each scan including professional and facility fee at our institution, radiation dosage, and radiographic results were analyzed.Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Chart review, and radiation dose equivalents were estimate from the Radiation Internal Dose Information Center (Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Oak Ridge, TN).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:126 children (102 girls and 24 boys) met the inclusion criteria. The median age at presentation with febrile UTI was 8.1 months. The median age at first DMSA was 10.1 months. A total of 145 RUS and 171 DMSA were performed during the study period. Cost analysis revealed $865/RUS. DMSA $1,062/scan, and $2,115/scan for those children who need anesthetic sedation. The mean cumulative effective dose per patient/ DMSA was 3.75 mSv. This increased to 6.95 mSv for patients who underwent 3 scans. Limitations include retrospective design, tertiary referral center.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Both cost and radiation exposure from DMSA were significant when compared to RUS. Radiation exposure approached that of a pediatric chest CT (2-5 mSv) for a single DMSA.Radiation exposure in early childhood can have significant impact on future cancer risk. Given the improved sensitivity of newer ultrasounds and comparable cost, efforts should be made to determine which children with urinary tract infection would benefit most from nuclear tests.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Retrospective studies at our institution and others have found these to be low yield.  After our retrospective investigation, we changed our practice to avoid obtaining a routine post-operative film.  In this study, we examine the impact of our clinical change on chest radiograph utilization, adverse events, and cost benefit.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  After obtaining institutional review board approval, we reviewed the charts of patients undergoing central venous catheter placement by the pediatric surgery or interventional radiology service between January 2010 and July 2014 was performed.  Outcome measures included CXR within 24 hours of catheter placement, reason for chest radiograph, complication, and complication requiring intervention. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  In the study population 622 catheters were placed under fluoroscopy.  A chest radiograph was performed in 118 (19%) patients within 24 hours of the line placement with 25 (4%) of these patients being symptomatic in the recovery room.  One patient required a chest tube for shortness of breath and pleural effusion.  Four symptomatic patients (0.6%) were found to have a pneumothorax, none of which required intervention. There were no re-operations due mal-position of the catheter.  In the 504 patients with no postoperative chest x-ray, there were no adverse outcomes. At our institution, the current average charge of a chest radiograph is $283, thus we produced savings of $142,632 over the study period without adverse events.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  After placement of central venous catheter under fluoroscopic guidance, a chest radiograph is unlikely to be helpful in an asymptomatic patient.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Mitigating risks involved by using various quality control measures can help reduce injuries; however, studies have predominantly focused on adult and inter-hospital transfers, with relatively little attention given to the more common intra-hospital transfer of pediatric patients. A systematic literature review was conducted to characterize adverse events (AE) encountered during intra-hospital transfers (IHT) of pediatric patients and to examine current quality control measures (QCM).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Studies investigating IHT of pediatric patients were found in the English-language literature of three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science), using the help of a medical librarian. We collected relevant outcome measures such as AE and QCM, along with study design and interventions used. Studies meeting inclusion criteria, based on two independent reviewers, were further categorized into the primary outcomes: AE identified and type of QCM. A Cohen's unweighted kappa was used to determine inter-rater agreement. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the initial 43 articles, 12 satisfied inclusion criteria, with a moderate inter-rater agreement on title/abstract review (k=0.54[0.34-0.74]). These studies focused on AE (5), QCM (1), or both (6) [see Table 1]. Only 6 of the 11 investigating AE and 2 of the 7 studies reporting QCM were prospective. A total of 1591 IHT were evaluated prospectively, with physiological deterioration accounting for 71% of reported AE, equipment failure 20%, and interventions required in 9%. These events mostly occurred during transfer between an intensive care unit and other parts of the hospital, and were related to extended duration of transport and sicker pre-transfer status of the patient (ventilation status, PRISM score). AE from human error can be remedied by teamwork and checklists to standardize QCM; while AE from disease processes can be improved by standardization of transfer protocols. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This review highlights the most common AE of pediatric IHT and suggests QCM to improve patient safety. Additional prospective studies to set threshold values for AE and to determine effectiveness of QCM should be conducted. This article impacts hospital policies and QCM used to benchmark and standardize pediatric IHT to reduce AE.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient Safety and Quality","Cross Disciplinary"

Current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend CVL removal for bacteremia.  However, many IF patients have limited venous access prompting initial attempts to salvage the line (non-removal of the CVL and antibiotic treatment).  Here we describe predictors of line salvage at our institution, a topic which has been poorly understood historically. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The database for the Georgeson Center for Advanced Intestinal Rehabilitation (GCAIR) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham was queried from 2010-2015 to identify all patients with IF that were admitted for a CVL infection.  Demographics and clinical parameters were compared among patients who underwent line removal to patients where the line was salvaged.    Results were compared by a student's unpaired T test.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Forty patients were identified with 125 admissions for CVL infections. Line removal occurred in 71(56.8%) and 54(43.8%) successfully had their lines salvaged.  The average age (months) for the removed group was 29.38 and 28.39 for the salvage group.  Episodes of life threating sepsis were less frequent among the salvaged group as well as fungemia (p&lt;0.0001).  There was no significant difference in the non-fungal organisms cultured, location of the CVL, and number of previous admissions.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:With the exception of cases of fungemia, line salvage of infected CVLs should be attempted in patients with IF when clinically possible.  General pediatric CVL infection guidelines should be modified for patients with IF with limited venous access to address line salvaging methods.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

The purpose of this study is to determine the epidemiology, etiology, and relationship of supracondylar elbow fractures with child abuse.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  75 consecutive displaced supracondylar elbow fractures were reviewed to determine specific information about the manner in which the injury occurred. Medical records and radiographs were analyzed for demographic and injury data. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 42 males (56%) and 33 females (44%) were studied. The average age was 6 years (range: 1 year 4 months to 12 years 4 months). 2 patients were 1-2 years of age, 3 were 2-3 years of age, and 70 were older than 3. The left elbow was fractured in 45 cases (60%). 87% were right hand dominant, 9% were left hand dominant, and 4% were too young to determine handedness. 58% injured the non-dominant arm. 24 (31%) were Gartland Type 2 and 52 (69%) were Gartland Type 3 fractures. 1 fracture was open. 8 (11%) fractures had a pucker sign. 11% presented with a nerve palsy. 5% presented without a pulse. 7 patients (9%) presented with an additional ipsilateral distal radius fracture. 64 fractures (85%) were transferred from 27 different outside hospitals in 17 counties, while 11 fractures (15%) presented directly to the ED. 35 fractures (47%) occurred at home, 30 (40%) on the school grounds, 4 (5%) in a gymnasium, 4 (5%) in a park, 1 at a farm show, and 1 in a parking lot. 24 fractures were treated between midnight and 8am, 15 were treated between 8am and 5pm, and 33 were treated between 5pm and midnight. All fractures stemmed from a fall, including: playground equipment 29 (39%), furniture 10 (13%), sports 6 (8%), stairs 3 (4%), bikes 3 (4%), and miscellaneous-- running and tripping, falling from a toy ball, sled, tree, wagon, fence, bounce house, van, deck, power-wheels car, ATV, and go-cart. The average time from injury to the call for a transfer was 3 hours 5 minutes; transfer acceptance to arrival at ED-- 2 hours 1 min; arrival in ED to OR-- 5 hours 14 min; injury to OR-- 10 hours 20 min; and time to discharge-- 16 hours 39 min. Multiple medical professionals including outside ED physicians and orthopaedic surgeons, local ED physicians, local orthopaedic surgeons, residents, and nurses evaluated each patient. Only 1 patient, the youngest patient in the cohort at 1 year 4 months, injured from a fall at home, was reported for possible abuse and the evaluation was negative. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pediatric elbow supracondylar fractures occur from accidental falls while children are at play. The mechanism involves a fall on the outstretched hand, hyperextension of the elbow, and fracture of the humeral cortex at the supracondylar location. In this population, child abuse was rarely associated with supracondylar elbow fractures.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Treatment of Grade 1 and 2 straddle injuries most often consists of sitz baths, estrogen cream or antibiotic ointment. Surgical repair may be indicated for significant bleeding or deep lacerations. The purpose of this study is to report treatment and outcome of girls &lt;18 years of age with Grade 1 or 2 straddle injuries who were treated as outpatients (&lt; 24 hr observation) in a large, tertiary pediatric hospital. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An IRB approved retrospective review of all patients with Grade 1 and 2 straddle injury seen at Texas Children's Hospital in 2014 was performed. Exclusion criteria included male gender, admission &gt;24 hours or concern for sexual abuse. Data collected included age, time of year, mechanism of injury, management, and outcomes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 69 girls who met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 6 years (range 2-17). Injuries were most common in May and June (n=18, 26%). The main cause of injury was a fall at home (n=31), fall at school playgrounds (n=24), or a bicycle or scooter injury (n=10). There were no penetrating injuries in this series. 18 pts were transferred from an outside facility. 68% (n=47) of pts were managed solely by an emergency department (ED) physician, and 32% (n=21) were managed by the gynecologic or, less commonly, the surgical service. A consult from the ED was most often requested when pain prevented adequate examination and/or significant bleeding or deep lacerations were present. 15 patients (22%) required surgical repair of lacerations of the perineum, labia, or vaginal introitus&minus; 9/15 were treated in the operating room, 6/15 were treated in the ED under conscious sedation. There were no urethral or rectal injuries. Two patients required post-operative Foley catheters to relieve urinary retention. There were no other complications. The gynecology service prescribed at least 1 medicated cream (bacitracin, estrogen, lidocaine) in all patients, with 2 or more creams used in 71% of patients.

Section 3001 of ACA established the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program (VBP) to measure the value of healthcare provided by participating hospitals. The VPB established quality indicators for processes, outcomes, patient satisfaction and cost per Medicare beneficiary to estimate value (value=quality/cost) of care provided. The domains above were used to calculate the Total Performance Score (TPS) allowing CMS to rank hospitals. For 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) withheld 1.5% of each Medicare hospitals' anticipated annual payment to establish a financial framework for redistribution based upon TPS rank. High quality hospitals are rewarded and lower quality hospitals are punished. Review of the top 100 TPS included 27 physician-owned specialty hospitals (POSH) suggesting possible stratification by hospital type/business model.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We reviewed the February 2015 VBP database including hospital name, address, unadjusted and adjusted process, outcome, patient satisfaction, cost, and total performance scores. We chose to compare POSH with all hospitals and POSH with another hospital type, University Hospital Consortium (UHC) members. We used the general linear model to estimate the TPS reported for each hospital as a function of hospital category and categorized by POSH and UHC membership. The statistical significance of the association between TPS and hospital category was assessed using the F test statistic at the threshold of p &lt; 0.05.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The dataset included 3,089 hospitals with TPS ranging from 92.86 to 6.6 and a mean of 41.7. Of these 92 were identified as POSH and 111 were UHC hospitals. The mean TPS for POSH (64.43) was significantly higher than all other hospitals. Results from the general linear model indicate the estimated mean differences in TPS was 23.45 points higher for POSH (p &lt; 0.0001) compared to all other hospitals. The mean TPS for UHC hospitals (36.89) was significantly lower than all other hospitals. The mean difference in TPS was -4.95 points lower for UHC hospitals (p &lt; 0.0001) compared to all other hospitals.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:The Medicare VBP scoring method can effectively sort participating hospitals. Over time this methodology should improve, particularly with the development of progressively better quality indicators. Application of VBP should incentivize quality improvement and decrease healthcare cost. The observation that POSH had higher than average TPS and UHC hospitals had lower than average TPS requires further study. POSH include predominantly surgical centers while UHC hospitals represent a more heterogeneous patient population with large numbers of chronic disease. The observed differences comment on the need to further explore the impact of healthcare business models on outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical","Health Policy","Cross Disciplinary"

In large urban centers, appendectomies are often performed by both pediatric surgeons and adult trauma and acute care surgeons (TACS surgeons).  We hypothesized that children undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis have equivalent outcomes whether a pediatric surgeon or a TACS surgeon performs the operation.  To evaluate our hypothesis we analyzed the outcomes of pediatric appendectomy performed by three populations of surgeons; pediatric surgeons operating in a pediatric, tertiary referral center; pediatric surgeons operating in an urban safety-net hospital; and adult TACS surgeons operating in an urban safety-net hospital.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients under 18 years of age, who underwent appendectomy at either a tertiary care children's hospital (group A, n=100) or an urban safety net hospital between July 2010 and June 2015.  The population of patients operated upon at the safety net hospital was further subdivided into those operated upon by pediatric surgeons (group B, n=60) and those operated upon by adult TACS surgeons (group C, n=60). Baseline characteristics and operative outcomes were compared between these three patient populations utilizing one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-squared test for independence.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: When comparing the three populations, we found no difference in either the proportion of patients with complicated appendicitis (p=0.05), operative time (p=0.18), postoperative length of stay (p=0.14), rate of infectious complications (p=0.41), or rate of readmission (p=0.50).  The three study populations did differ with regard to the mean age of the patients operated upon (group A 9.4&plusmn;3.6 years [mean&plusmn; SD], group B 8.3&plusmn;3.6 years, and group C 12.4&plusmn;3.6 years; p &lt;0.0005); however, this can be attributed to protocol at the urban safety net hospital requiring patients less than 5 years old be treated by pediatric surgeons. Time from assessment in emergency department to operating room was also longer for patients in group B (13.1&plusmn;11.0 hours versus 9.8&plusmn;8.6 hours in group A and 8.3&plusmn;3.3 hours in group C, p=0.006), and there was a higher rate of open appendectomy among children operated on by both pediatric surgeons and TACS surgeons at the urban safety net hospital versus the children's hospital (30% in group B and 23.3% in group C versus 3.1% in group A, p &lt;0.0005).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our data demonstrate that among children undergoing appendectomy, length of stay, risk of infectious complications, and risk of readmission do not differ regardless of whether they are operated upon by pediatric surgeons or adult TACS surgeons, suggesting resources currently consumed by transferring children to hospitals with access to pediatric surgeons could be allocated elsewhere.","Outcomes/Clinical","Cost Effectiveness","Cross Disciplinary"

Langell<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Utah,Department Of Surgery,Salt Lake City, UT, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The financial healthcare crisis has significantly reduced operating revenues for healthcare organizations. Hospitals are now seeking better operational efficiency models within their organizations.  The successful application of Lean operation principles in manufacturing and other service sectors has resulted in its adoption by several healthcare organizations.  Lean focuses on a culture change that promotes creation of a continuous learning organization and empowers all employees to make changes that will ultimately lead to improved customer value.  One of the critical aspects of Lean is removing waste from a system to optimize the value equation.The practice of evidence-based medicine improves the value to patients through the application of proven patient management principles that improve outcomes and may reduce the costs. Historical data shows that even the strongest leels of evidence-based medicine do not have uniform adoption by practitioners, even when mandated and tracked by federal payers and quality organizations.  We believe that the uniform application of evidence-based medicine provides a simple and data-driven approach to Lean implementation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a literature search of the Cochrane database for evidence-based perioperative surgical care.  This identified several publications that conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of incentive spirometers (IS) to prevent pulmonary complications after abdominal and thoracic operations.  The data show that IS provides no efficacy in preventing these complications.  We then studied the use of IS in our hospital system including total IS used and annual cost of purchase.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We found broad use of IS and IS-teaching by surgeons across all disciplines in our hospital.  A review of IS purchasing noted that our 526 bed tertiary care hospital used a total of 11,051 incentive spirometers in 2013 at a purchase cost of $2.27 each, totaling $25,086.  The cost data does not include the additional cost of nursing teaching time, product stocking space or procurement resources.  There are 5,686 hospitals registered with the American Hospital Association and 914,513-staffed beds in the US and according to the CDC over 100 million surgical procedures performed in the United States annually. If our medical center's IS ordering practices and IS costs are relatively representative of US hospitals as a whole, the elimination of IS could save the healthcare system as much as $227,000,000 per year for a product that has evidence it provides no benefit to the general postoperative patient population. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The application of evidence-based medicine has greatly improved clinical outcomes, but has been shown to have variable adoption curves by healthcare practitioners.  Here we demonstrate that the application of evidence based medicine can also be use a tool to eliminate financial waste and improve hospital operations.","Outcomes/Clinical","Cost Effectiveness","Cross Disciplinary"

Although numerous studies have examined clinical outcomes of patients treated with and without SAE, there is a paucity of data that examines the economic impact of these treatment decisions. Our objective was to determine the cost implications of various strategies for non-operative management of BSI.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients with BSI were identified in the TRICARE database (2006 &ndash; 2010), a healthcare data repository of active and retired U.S. military personnel and their dependents. Patients who were managed non-operatively were classified as either having splenic artery embolization (SAE) or non-invasive management (NIM). Patients were categorized based on their Injury Severity Scores (ISS). Length of hospital stay, readmission rates, and 30 day complication rate (pneumonia, urinary tract infections, ileus/small bowel obstruction, wound infection, sepsis, acute renal failure) were determined. The 30-day costs of patient care (admission, readmission and complications) were calculated. A decision tree was used to determine the cost-effective strategy for various patient groups.  Effectiveness was measured using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 529 patients who were managed non-operatively: 41 had SAE and 488 had NIM. The majority of patients were male (78%), &lt; 45 years old (79%), with ISS &gt; 15 (54%). Comparing the SAE to the NIM groups showed similar in-hospital complications (9.80% vs. 10.50%, P &gt; 0.99), lower 30-day readmission rates (2.41% vs. 7.99%, P = 0.350), and similar rates of operation on readmission (0.00% vs. 1.40%, P &gt; 0.99). The costs measured in both groups increased as ISS increased. While the costs in the NIM and SAE groups were $5,882 and $18,766, respectively, for ISS &lt;9, the costs were $19,442 and $35,678, respectively, for ISS &gt;25. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of SAE vs. NIM were all above the commonly used willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY regardless of the ISS (Table), indicating that NIM was cost-effective compared to SAE.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our study suggests that the cost of SAE, as a strategy for non-operative BSI management, outweighs its benefits. As emphases on cost implications of patient management increase, these findings can prove useful in cost management in BSI patients.","Outcomes/Clinical","Cost Effectiveness","Cross Disciplinary"

Great debate exists over the best approach to control costs and improve the quality of care provided to patients. The goal of this study was to examine the association between patient characteristics and the ability to receive optimal patient care from a public health perspective using colorectal cancer as a model.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective cohort study was performed using inpatient claims from California and New York (2008-2011) for all patients admitted with a new diagnosis of colon (CC) or rectal cancer (RC). From a public health perspective, optimal care was defined as a patient who was not admitted through the emergency department and underwent surgery within the first 24 hours of admission for a known nonmetastatic CC or RC. Univariate and multivariate regression was used to compare patients who received optimal care to those who did not with planned subset analysis in the surgical cohort by malignancy.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 38,568 patients, 30,580 (79.3%) with CC and 7,988 (20.7%) with RC were identified. There were 5,626 patients with metastatic disease. There were 19,268 (50.0%) patients who had surgery within first 24hrs and 29,868 (77.4%) were not admitted via the emergency department. Optimal care was received by 14,109 (36.9%) patients; 8,807 (29.0%) of CC and 5,302 (67.6%) of RC patients (p&lt;0.001). Patients with commercial insurance had the highest rates of optimal care (42.2%) compared to Medicare (34.6%), Medicaid (30.0%) and self-pay (21.3%; p&lt;0.001). In multivariate analysis race, sex, number of comorbidities and insurance status were significantly associated with the likelihood of receiving optimal cancer care (see table).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite numerous public health campaigns to increase awareness of colorectal cancer and available screening modalities, less than 40% of patients receive optimal care leading up to definitive treatment. Future efforts to increase the proportion of patients receiving optimal care will depend on significant buy-in from patients, the physicians they encounter prior to surgery and policies that make compliance with screening recommendations more feasible.","Outcomes/Clinical","Health Policy","Cross Disciplinary"

CUA can comprehensively assess a wide range issues in the care of surgical patients. To date, comprehensive assessment of the CUA literature in surgery has not been conducted. The purpose of our study was to investigate the use and quality of CUA in surgical research.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A comprehensive Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry, which catalogs more than 4297 peer-reviewed English-language CUAs through 2013, was used. This registry performs yearly systematic review of the CUA literature since 1976 and collects publication information, methodological characteristics, cost effectiveness ratios as well as utility weights from each article.  Study characteristics were analyzed over three time periods: 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2013. The quality of CUAs in the registry was rated on a 7-point scale. General surgery disciplines (GS) include general, bariatric, cardiothoracic, colorectal, oncologic, pediatric, transplant, trauma, and vascular surgeries. Trends were compared using the Cochran-Armitage trend test and designated significant if p&lt;0.05.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Out of the 4297 CUA articles in the CEA Registry, 647 (15.06%) focused on surgical interventions. The number of surgical CUA publications per year increased from 7.6 articles per year in 1990-1999 to 62.3 articles per year in 2010-2013 (p&lt;0.03 for trend; see figure). This rate of increase was dwarfed by the increase in non-surgical CUA publications (26.3 articles per year in 1990-1999 to 395.8 articles per year in 2010-2013; p&lt;0.005). The proportion of CUAs evaluating GS disciplines compared to other surgical subspecialties decreased significantly over time (from 55.2% in 1990-1999 to 41.6% in 2010-2013; p&lt;0.001). The quality of CUAs was similar when comparing GS discipline to non-surgical CUAs (4.47 vs. 4.54, p=0.18). However the quality of GS discipline CUAs was superior compared other surgical subspecialties (4.47 vs. 4.19, p&lt;0.005).

Surgeon-patient communication during awake procedures is an important component of the overall patient experience and has been inadequately described in the literature.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Surgeons who perform a high volume of procedures on awake (no sedation or conscious sedation) patients were identified at two medical centers.  Surgeons were contacted via email to participate in audio-recorded semi-structured interviews.  Interviews were continued until saturation was reached.  Review of transcripts allowed for iterative development of themes by two researchers; discrepancies were resolved by consensus.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Fifty two percent of surgeons agreed to participate, consisting of 23 faculty from 8 surgical specialties. Surgeons describe the primary drivers to perform awake procedures as decreased physiologic and monetary patient impact and increased procedure efficiency, while anticipated emotional, sensory and physical responses are deterrents. Surgeons emphasize that pre-procedure expectation management and a calm environment are integral contributors to the patient experience. Intra-procedure surgeon-patient communication is focused on providing instructions, verifying patient comfort, alerting the patient to changes in stimulation, diverting patient attention, and using words that do not cause patient alarm. Surgeon communication with staff and trainees is modified with an awake patient: verbal exchanges are minimized and quiet or nonverbal communication is utilized. With less explicit communication, surgeons value working with consistent teams. Trainee presence decreases focus on the patient. All surgeons report an absence of formal training in awake communication skills and report development of their techniques through observation of mentors and trial and error. Numerous surgeons report feeling insecure in their techniques and cite interest in learning other awake communication methods.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Awake surgical procedures are unique circumstances for doctor-patient communication. Surgeons cite varied techniques to prepare and reassure patients before and during the procedure. Inconsistent education in communication skills results in surgeon insecurity. Challenges with trainee involvement warrant further evaluation of teaching practices, surgeon-trainee communication and the effect on patients during awake procedures. Development of best practices and a formalized curriculum in awake procedure communication would offer surgeons useful guidance for optimizing patient experience.","Outcomes/Clinical","Ethics/Bioethics","Cross Disciplinary"

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) includes professionalism, defined as adherence to ethical principles, as one of its six core principles. Although most general surgery residency programs currently include some consideration of ethics in their curricula, the content and format for ethics education varies widely. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a surgical ethics curriculum specifically for surgical residents that was integrated into the clinical conference schedule. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A year-long, IRB-approved curriculum was developed focusing on eight major topics within surgical ethics: informed consent, transplantation, withdrawing and withholding care, surgical training, error disclosure, surgical innovation, surgical research and global surgery. Each topic was presented as a case-based discussion drawing from selected readings with faculty-led moderation and presentation of pertinent clinical issues. Residents participated in pre- and post-test closed-form surveys assessing their attitudes toward ethics education, confidence in their skills in management of challenging ethical situations, and factual knowledge of key concepts in surgical ethics.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Forty categorical general surgery residents participated in at least one component of the curriculum. Of these, 31 completed the pre-test and 21 completed the post-test; 16 completed both. Although 75% of residents had received formal ethics training previously, 94% believed ethics education to be 'important' or 'very important.' Prior to participating in the course, residents felt most comfortable with informed consent and least comfortable with advanced directives and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders. Residents scored an average of 68.6% (range 52.6&ndash;89.5%, n=31) on 19 multiple choice knowledge-based questions on the pre-test and did not significantly improve with the course. Pre-test scores did not correlate with level of residency as compared between junior (PGY 1-2) and senior (PGY 3-5) residents (P=0.42). There was a trend toward improved confidence in all areas at the completion of the curriculum and a significant improvement in confidence managing advanced directives and DNR orders (P&lt;0.001, n=16). Most participating residents responded with 'somewhat agree' or 'strongly agree' to statements that the course was useful, made an important contribution to their surgical training and was valuable for future residents.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:A surgical ethics curriculum can be successfully implemented as part of general surgery residency and residents value a curriculum that presents relevant issues to their training.

One proposed method is to improve on time first case starts in the OR, though related financial analysis is lacking. The purpose of this study is to determine the downstream effect and financial impact of improving on-time starts for the first case of the day in the outpatient operating room at an academic teaching institution. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The Department of Surgery set a goal to decrease first case delays, specifically those attributable to surgeons. On time starts were defined as those beginning within 10 minutes of the scheduled start time. Beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2014, major efforts were made to improve surgeon related first start delays. On-time start percentage and over-utilized time were measured in the outpatient surgery setting and cost was estimated using a per-minute OR direct cost value. Fisher&#39;s exact chi square test was used to assess proportional differences in first case delay percentage between FY 2013 and 2014. An independent samples t-test was performed to analyze pre-post changes in mean monthly over-utilized time. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: At baseline, the rate of first-case delays in the Department of Surgery was 7.5%.Post improvement efforts, this rate improved to 4.8% (p &lt; 0.05). The Department of Surgery saw a 51% drop in over-utilized time, corresponding to 998 fewer minutes that ORs ran past 5 pm.. The monthly average over-utilized time in the Department of Surgery decreased by 84 minutes per month (p &lt; 0.05, 95% CI [22,146]). These improvements were estmated to translate into an average direct cost savings of $1,300.00 per month. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Improving on-time first case starts by promoting surgeon timeliness is associated with decreases in over-utilized time at the end of the OR day. While direct cost-savings in the outpatient surgery setting may be minimal, decreasing over-utilized time does have some financial benefit and likely improves the work environment by avoiding overtime staffing issues.","Outcomes/Clinical","Cost Effectiveness","Cross Disciplinary"

Telemedicine has proven beneficial in decreasing readmission in chronic medical illnesses such as chronic heart failure, but its utility in the management of surgical patients is not well studied.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of teleconferencing in the assessment of ileostomy output.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: An IRB-approved, prospective clinical trial was conducted at a single institution from November, 2014-June, 2015.  Patients &gt;18 years of age undergoing surgery with the potential for a new ileostomy were eligible.  Teleconference rounds were conducted during their postoperative stay using Face Time on iPad2 tablets within a HIPPA compliant network.  Teleconference rounds were followed immediately by in-person rounds.  The attending surgeon evaluated the character of the ileostomy output via teleconference and subsequent in-person assessment utilizing 5-point likert scales: one rated thin to thick and one based on comparison to food products.  The primary endpoint of feasibility was defined as 90% agreement between the teleconference and in-person assessments.  Patient and physician satisfaction surveys were recorded.  Secondary endpoints including output volume, need for antidiarrheal medications, and the incidence of dehydration related events (including need for outpatient intravenous fluids (IVFs) or readmission) were assessed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Fifty patients were enrolled.  Ileostomies were not required at surgery in ten patients who were excluded.  Twelve patients did not have paired evaluations of the ostomy output and were unevaluable leaving 28 patient encounters with both teleconference and in-person evaluations.  Agreement in the assessment of ileostomy output was 96.4% using the 5-point likert scale rated from thin to thick and 89.3% utilizing a comparison to food-based scale.  Eleven patients (27.5%) were readmitted; including five patients for dehydration.  An additional 3 patients required outpatient IVFs for an overall 20% rate of dehydration events (readmission or outpatient IVFs).  Both patients and physicians viewed the teleconferencing favorably.  For patients and physicians, 75% and 86.9%, respectively, felt videoconferencing should be a routine part of post-operative care.  Similarly, 90.9% and 87%, respectively, felt comfortable with the use of videoconferencing in outpatient follow up.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Teleconference evaluation is a feasible, reliable means of assessing ileostomy output with high patient and physician acceptance.

However, turnover time is rated by staff as a significant source of inefficiency and dissatisfaction in the OR. Increasing OR staff satisfaction by decreasing turnover times may itself be valuable by improving employee retention and workplace atmosphere. Our objective is to examine the impact of quality improvement (QI) efforts aimed at decreasing time between surgeries on OR efficiency and staff satisfaction.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  OR turnover efficiency improvements were implemented in inpatient surgery at an academic hospital.

When a consistent team is not available, and/or when multiple trainees are involved, oversight by an experienced individual can facilitate a timely start. Thyroid, parathyroid and adrenal procedures represent cases in which patient positioning, ultrasonography, nerve monitoring, and/or vascular access for hormone measurements during the procedure may occur before the operation can start. The study hypothesized that early attending presence in the OR expedites surgery start time, improving OR efficiency and decreasing cost. MethodsPatients undergoing thyroid, parathyroid or adrenal procedures at an urban teaching hospital were selected. Time points were recorded, and calculated as hours:minutes. Cost per minute (m) of OR time was $54. Patients were classified as in the OR &le;10m prior to attending arrival or &gt;10m prior to attending arrival. Data are presented as mean &plusmn; SD.Results227 cases were performed over 14 months. Thyroidectomy was most common (n=166, 73%), with 54 parathyroid (25%) and 10 adrenal (4.4%) procedures.  Combined thyroid and parathyroid procedures occured for 7. 89% were female patients, and a mean age 48&plusmn;15.128 patients (56%) were in the OR &le;10m prior to attending arrival and 99 patients (44%) were &gt;10m (0:03&plusmn;3 vs. 0:35&plusmn;14, p&lt;0.01). Gender distribution was equivalent (p=1.0). &le;10m patients were older (50&plusmn;15 vs. 46&plusmn;14, p=0.04). Adrenal cases were equivalent (5% vs. 4%, p=1), while &le;10m included more parathyroid (32% vs. 15%, p&lt;0.01) and fewer thyroid cases (66% vs. 82%, p&lt;0.01).&le;10m procedures started sooner after patient arrival in OR (0:40&plusmn;11 vs. 1:03&plusmn;19, p&lt;0.01). Associated OR costs per minute were $2,206&plusmn;614 vs. $3,430&plusmn;1065 (p&lt;0.01), or $1,202 savings before the operation even began in the &le;10m group.Adrenal and parathyroid had equivalent attending time in the OR prior incision between &le;10m and &gt;10m (p=0.98 and p=0.80). However, patient time in OR prior incision for adrenal cases (0:58&plusmn;7 vs. 1:42&plusmn;30, p&lt;0.01) and parathyroid cases (0:39&plusmn;9 vs. 1:06&plusmn;13, p&lt;0.01) were shorter in the &le;10m group. This equates to $2,416&plusmn;477 in savings for adrenal and $1,458&plusmn;244 for parathyroid cases. For thyroid, attending time in OR prior incision was longer in &le;10m than &gt;10m (0:37&plusmn;11 vs. 0:24&plusmn;14, p&lt;0.01), but cases still started sooner (0:40&plusmn;11 vs. 1:00&plusmn;17, p&lt;0.01). This equates to $1076&plusmn;120 in savings per thyroidectomy.ConclusionEarly attending presence in the OR shortens time to incision, decreasing costs. For parathyroid and adrenal cases, this does not require additional time from the attending surgeon.  In ORs without consistent teams or with multiple trainees, early attending presence in the OR improves OR efficiency and results in significant cost savings.","Outcomes/Clinical","Cost Effectiveness","Cross Disciplinary"

Our goal was to examine characteristics of retracted surgery-related papers.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  NCBI Pub-Med database was queried using 'surgery,' 'surg,' or 'surgical' and 'retracted' or 'retraction.'  Unrelated and non-retracted articles were excluded.  Article, journal, and retraction details were recorded.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 186 retracted surgical papers identified from 1991-2015.  Average time to retraction was 3.6 years. Retracted papers were most often seen in general (25.8%), cardiac (22%), and orthopedic (10.2%) surgery.  Articles were related to anesthesia and basic science in 32% and 11% cases, respectively.  Authors were most commonly from the United States (21.5%), Germany (19%) and Japan (16%).  Median impact factor (IF) of retracted papers was 2.4 (0.27-12.48).Retraction reasons were 1) content related: duplication (34%), falsified data (15%), data errors (9%), plagiarism (8%), and 2) administrative: IRB concerns (19%), author dispute (9%), copyright (2%).  No reason was given in 8% and 24% were behind a paywall (requiring payment to view notice). Median IF was higher for administrative than content-related reasons (3.42 vs. 2.12, P&lt;.01).  Plastic surgery, transplant surgery, basic science, non-anesthesia content, and publisher were predictive of a paywall for the retraction (P&lt;.01).  IF, content, and publisher did not predict whether a reason for the retraction was given.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The majority of surgical retraction notices have a reason listed and do not require payment to read. These findings provide a baseline analysis for surgeons to identify reasons for retraction and to focus on areas for improvement in transparency.","Outcomes/Clinical","Ethics/Bioethics","Cross Disciplinary"

The global need for expanded access has been quantified, but surgical systems at a country level remain poorly described. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery developed a set of six indicators that can point to opportunities to strengthen surgical systems, however, these are not yet uniformly collected. We aimed to collect country-level data on the proportion of the population within two hours of a surgical hospital (two-hour access), the number of surgical, anesthesia, and obstetric specialists per 100,000 population (SAO density), the number of surgical procedures per 100,000 population per year (surgical volume), the perioperative mortality rate (POMR), and the number of individuals who face impoverishing and catastrophic expenditures paying for surgery each year. Our goal is to collect robust data on at least 50% of countries for each indicator so that the World Bank can include these among the World Development Indicators.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Collaborators contributed modelled estimates of surgical volume and SAO density, and a co-author provided modelled estimates of impoverishing and catastrophic expenditures. To collect primary data from Ministries of Health for the remaining indicators, we trained a team of eight research associates, developed an online data management system, assembled country contacts at Ministries of Health, and developed a strategy for outreach. With the support of our team, health leaders around the world reported data for their respective countries.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:This work is ongoing, with anticipated completion in autumn 2015. To date, we have assembled modelled data on surgical volume, SAO density, and catastrophic and impoverishing expenditures for 194, 167, and 186 out of 215 countries, respectively. Two weeks after starting data collection, we have contacted 212 of 215 Ministries of Health. We have obtained at least partial data for 41 countries and have active communication with 44 more. Of these, 45 responses were from high-income countries (of 80 HIC total), 14 from upper-middle-income countries (of 53 UMIC), 14 from lower-middle-income countries (of 51 LMIC), and 12 from low-income countries (of 31 LIC).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:We have met WDI inclusion thresholds for four indicators using modelled data. New primary data will help to improve these estimates and to advance our understanding of the two remaining indicators: two-hour access and POMR. This effort will send a signal to the global health community that surgery is an &quot;indivisible, indispensable part of health care&quot; that requires investment and continual monitoring during the era of the Sustainable Development Goals.","Outcomes/Clinical","Health Policy","Cross Disciplinary"

Many studies have demonstrated that female senior executives operate with a greater degree of energy and intensity, are more assertive and competitive in their approach to achieving goals, and obtain a better financial bottom line.  The aim of this study is to evaluate if these female leadership advantages exist in a resuscitation room by examining if a team led by a female trauma surgeon has better patient outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We preformed a retrospective cohort study involving all adult trauma patients who were admitted to our level 1 trauma center from July 1, 2012 to September 30, 2012. Our center is led by 6 full-time surgical attendings (male = 3, female = 3) with call distributed equally amongst all attendings. The goal was to evaluate the effect of the gender of the admitting trauma surgeon on patient disposition (home, observation, ICU or operating room) while controlling for patient sex, age, mechanism of injury and trauma severity as defined by the Injury Severity Score (ISS). Secondary outcomes included length of stay (LOS), readmissions, and mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using a &chi; <sup>2</sup>  test to obtain likelihood ratios and Student's t-test when appropriate.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:654 patients were enrolled in the study of which 647 patients were analyzed. The study population was 80% male with a mean age of 35.1 years and mean ISS of 8. No difference was noted between patients seen by male and female attendings. When stratified by ISS, no statistically significant relationship was found between the gender of the admitting trauma surgeon and patient disposition after initial resuscitation. Mean LOS, readmissions, and mortality were also equal.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Patients with equal ISS were given the same disposition after resuscitation, averaged the same LOS, and had no difference in readmission or mortality regardless of the gender of the admitting surgeon. Our results suggest that although males and females may have different leadership styles, in the setting of leading the resuscitation of an acutely injured patient, the gender of the trauma surgeon does not impact outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

The patients were divided into three groups according to age, younger than 64 (young), from 65 to 74 (young-old), and older than 75 (old-old).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Elderly patients had advanced stage at diagnosis (stage III and IV =11.6: 11.4: 15.2%), no difference in estrogen/progesterone-receptor (hormone receptor: HR) positive (83.1: 80.7: 82.4%), and less HER2 positive tumors (14.1: 10.1: 7.8%). They were more likely to undergo mastectomy (44.4: 42.1: 51.5%) and to omit axillary surgery (0.2: 0.7: 2.1%). Among entire patients, elderly patients were less likely to receive adjuvant systemic therapy (92.5: 91.3: 76.6%) and radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery (91.6: 85.0: 22.9%) compared with their younger counterparts. Among HR positive patients, more than 90% of patients received adjuvant hormone therapy (97.0: 96.0: 91.9%), and less likely to receive chemotherapy (46.4: 28.4: 10.1%), however 5 years disease free survival are not different among age (90.5: 89.8: 92.5%).

Over the last decade, minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy has emerged as safe and feasible.  The aim of this project was to examine if omission of an immediate post-operative ICU admission would be safe and result in decreased length of stay (LOS) and reduced cost for patients undergoing robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD). <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  From December 2014 to June 2015, a non-ICU admission policy on post-operative day zero (POD0) was implemented for all patients undergoing RPD.  Prior to this date, all RPDs were routinely admitted to the ICU on POD0.  Using a prospectively maintained database, we compared the outcomes of the non-ICU RPD cohort to patients routinely admitted to the ICU post-operatively prior to implementation of this policy (January 2014-November 2014).  All cases were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis, thereby minimizing selection bias.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The ICU cohort (n=49, average age 65.6 &plusmn;12, 51% females) and non-ICU cohort (n=34, average age 66.4 &plusmn; 9, 38% females) were comparable with no statistically significant differences with respect to age, sex, BMI, CCI and ASA score, pre-operative tumor size, diagnosis, receipt of neoadjuvant therapy, operative time, and estimated blood loss.  Seven patients (21%) from the non-ICU group were directly admitted to the ICU post-operatively based on unpredicted changes in intra-operative clinical status necessitating ICU care.  They were included in the non-ICU group and their outcomes were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.  The rates of Clavien complications, pancreatic leak, reoperation, readmission and mortality demonstrated no statistically significant difference between both groups (Table 1).  A statistically significant trend toward reduced total hospital LOS in the non-ICU group was noted (median 6.95 days versus 7.7 days, P=0.083).  This reduced LOS and avoidance of routine post-operative ICU admission translated into a cost reduction from $25,812 (IQR $19,875 -$29,853) in the ICU group to $19,739 (IQR $17,964 -$25,521) in the non-ICU group, P=0.01.   The reduction in cost remained statistically significant even after adjusting for all related demographics and perioperative characteristics.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A standard policy of omitting a post-operative ICU admission on POD0 following RPD is safe and can result in reduced length of stay and overall savings in total hospital cost.","Outcomes/Clinical","Cost Effectiveness","Cross Disciplinary"

A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of patients from 25 participating hospitals collected between January and September 2014. Functional status represents an individual's ability to perform the activities of daily living. The main outcome of interest was decline in functional status from preoperative baseline compared to at the time of hospital discharge (independent preoperatively to partially or totally dependent postoperatively, or partially dependent preoperatively to totally dependent postoperatively). Excluded cases were orthopedic and spinal procedures, death within 30 days, and patients whose preoperative functional status was total dependence. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify significant predictors for functional decline.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The study included 6,295 patients with the average age of 74&plusmn;8 years. The rate of functional decline was 15% among patients &lt;=65 years of age, 14% for ages 66-75 years, 23% for ages 76-85, and 39% for those over age 85 years. On multivariable regression, significant predictors for functional decline included age 76-85 or &gt;85 (OR 1.6 and 2.6, respectively, 95% CI 1.1-2.3 and 1.7-4.0, respectively), female sex (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5), ASA class 3 or 4 (OR 2.7 and 3.3, respectively with 95% CI 1.1-7.2 and 1.3-9.0, respectively), history of COPD (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.7), diabetes requiring insulin (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6), disseminated cancer (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1), having experienced a fall within 1 year prior to the operation (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0), or the use of a mobility aid preoperatively (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.7-2.4). Additional factors associated with functional decline were an emergency operation (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.8-2.9) or experiencing postoperative complication (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-2.1). Factors found to be protective were overweight status (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9) and other race (non-white, non-Hispanic, non-black)(OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.5).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Functional decline occurs in older adults following surgery. This occurs in the 'younger old' as well as 'oldest old'. Adjusted analysis finds that advancing age, female sex, high ASA class, certain comorbidities, prior falls and use of mobility aids are associated with functional decline. Counselling high-risk patients about the risk of losing independent functional status is an important component of preoperative decision-making for older adults.","Outcomes/Clinical","Geriatric Surgery","Cross Disciplinary"

Factors analyzed were age, sex, clinical diagnosis, procedure, past medical history, ASA physical status classification, current smoking status, minimum intra-operative mean arterial pressure (MAP), minimum O<sub>2</sub> saturation, estimated blood loss, fluids, anesthesia duration, antibiotic administration, days to discharge and 30-day readmissions. All patients underwent general anesthesia. Data was provided from history &amp; physical forms, operative notes, anesthesia flowsheets and progress notes. Frequencies and means of the factors were calculated. Mortality was included only if it occurred within 30 days of surgery.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 210 patients undergoing ambulatory anorectal surgery, there were no mortalities within 30 days of surgery. Mean age was 44.6 and 72.4% of patients were male. Complication rate was 3.3% with urinary retention taking up 42% of that. 30-day readmission rate from surgery was 1%. This encompassed two cases of rectal bleeding status-post excision &amp; fulguration of anal condylomas and bright red blood per rectum status-post hemorrhoid surgery. 98.1% of patients were discharged same day of surgery. Mean minimum intra-operative MAP and O<sub>2</sub> saturation was 70.6 and 98.7%, respectively. The most common clinical diagnoses were anal condylomas (37.6%), hemorrhoids (14.8%) and pilonidal cysts (11%).  The most common procedures therefore were excision &amp; fulguration, hemorrhoidal surgery and pilonidal cyst excision. Anal condyloma was the most common past medical history (40.4%), followed by HIV/AIDS (39%) and hypertension (32.3%). Current smoking rate was 45.7%.

Recognition of communication, leadership, and interpersonal skills as vital components of formal surgical training has resulted in ACGME-accredited skills training initiatives among residencies nationwide. However, early evaluation among medical students considering surgical careers has yet to be studied, and no specific training interventions have been initiated among graduating medical students to date. The purpose of this study was to examine and identify the influences of an early training intervention on teamwork and team performance among medical school graduates continuing onto surgical internship through the use of video recordings of an animal model operative simulation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Video recordings of nine graduating medical student interactions were obtained during a full-day surgical case simulation utilizing porcine models. The animal model simulation was the final day of a two-week surgery intern preparatory curriculum for graduating medical students accepted into ACGME-accredited surgical internships. Two randomly assigned groups of students utilized two separate porcine models to perform common operative procedures, termed learning modules. Students received real-time instruction and feedback from residents and attending surgeons. The tasks were primarily performed by the students. All video recordings were reviewed for outcomes pertaining to teamwork knowledge, skills, and attitudes of the participants. The number of actions initiated and task, skill, and team activities were recorded for each individual. This study was qualitative and observational in nature.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Nine medical students were de-identified and randomly divided into two groups, A and B. Team A consisted of 5 subjects, and Team B consisted of 4. The primary observations among participants included various dimensions of teamwork as follows: willingness to participate, encouragement of others, and self-appointed versus instructor-appointed leadership. Dominant individuals were identified as having the greatest hands-on participation and the greatest number of self-initiated actions within each learning module.

The extent of communication disabilities in the surgical population has never been described. We aimed to describe the prevalence of communication disabilities in adult surgical patients from a nationally representative sample.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). NHIS is a nationally representative, stratified, multistage survey that uses face-to-face interviews with non-institutionalized respondents to estimate health care utilization, access, and health-related behaviors for the U.S. population. In 2012, NHIS included a one-time supplemental section focused on communication disabilities. We utilized the 2012 NHIS Sample Adult Core questionnaire to examine the frequency of hearing, speech, language, and voice disabilities in a subpopulation of adult NHIS respondents who reported an inpatient or outpatient surgical procedure within the last twelve months. Additional surgical details were not available. We then conducted subgroup analyses by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and geographic region. To generalize observed results to the U.S. population, survey weights and variance estimations were applied to all statistics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In 2012, 12.2% (95% CI: 11.7-12.7%) of the US adult population reported a surgical procedure within the last year, and 22.9% (95% CI: 22.3-23.5) experienced a communication disability. Subpopulation analysis limited to surgical patients (Table 1) revealed that approximately one third (33.8%, 95% CI: 32.1-35.5) reported a communication disability. The most commonly reported disability was hearing (23.5, 95% CI: 21.8-25.2) followed by voice (12.8, 95% CI: 11.6-14.0), speech (4.6, 95% CI: 3.7-5.5), and language (2.2, 95% CI: 1.7-2.8).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Patients with communication disabilities comprise a major segment of the U.S. adult surgical population. This high prevalence, when combined with a lack of medical professional training and awareness, not only calls into question surgeons' ability to provide patient-centered care to a significant percentage of their patient population, but also suggests an opportunity to address a source of preventable adverse events, inadequate informed consent, and poor patient satisfaction.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient-Centered Outcomes","Cross Disciplinary"

Falaiye<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Penn State Hershey Medical Center,Hershey, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease is globally increasing in incidence. Advances in medical and surgical therapy have improved outcomes over the past two decades. While inpatient hospitalizations and rates of surgery are reportedly decreasing in other countries, trends in the rates of various types of inpatient surgeries in the United States have not been widely reported.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Pediatric patients &le;20 years of age with either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) were identified in the HCUP KID database (2003, 2006, 2009, 2012). Surgeries including bowel resection, stoma creation, and perianal or percutaneous drainage procedures were identified using ICD-9 procedure codes. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with surgical intervention, while linear regression was used to identify factors associated with LOS and costs. Regression was also used to test the significance of trends in procedure rates over time. Survey weights were used to obtain estimates of national trends.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Increasing numbers of hospitalizations for both CD and UC patients from ages 0 to 20 were found from 2003-2012 (up from 126 per 100,000 hospitalizations to 197 for CD; up from 68 per 100,000 to 115 for UC, both p&lt;0.001). UC patients had higher LOS (6.4 vs. 5.4 days, p&lt;0.001) and hospitalization costs ($15,011.20 vs. $12,356.80, p&lt;0.001). CD had higher rates of intestinal resection (10.0% vs. 8.1%, p&lt;0.001), but rates of stoma creation were higher in UC (8.6% vs. 2.2%, p&lt;0.001). Factors associated with both intestinal resection and stoma creation (ileostomy or colostomy) include age between 10-20 years, male gender, Caucasian or Asian race, elective admission, and admission to an urban teaching hospital (all p&lt;0.05). Whereas resection was associated with CD and fewer comorbidities, stoma creation was associated with UC and greater number of comorbidities (all p&lt;0.01). Perianal drainage and percutaneous drainage procedures were both significantly associated with CD diagnosis. Rates of these procedures did not change significantly over time, except for increased stoma creation in CD (OR 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.09) and increased percutaneous drainage in UC (OR 1.07, CI 1.00-1.14).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite increasing hospitalizations, the rates of common procedures in pediatric IBD patients have remained stable in the US over the last decade, with the exception of increasing stoma creation in Crohn's patients. This plateau may indicate improved medical control of IBD obviating the need for surgery, or changing indications for surgical treatment. Further studies examining changes in the timing of surgery and the effects of biologic agents on surgical rates are warranted.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient-Centered Outcomes","Cross Disciplinary"

Elderly patients are defined in most studies as anyone greater than 65 years. Few studies have characterized the elderly population by age groups. We hypothesize that increasing age is associated with worse post-operative outcomes including readmission.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We queried the 2011-2013 National Surgical Quality improvement Program (NSQIP) cohort for patients who underwent an elective colectomy and stratified them into age categories: 18-50, 51 to 60, 61 to 70, 71 to 80, and over 80. Univariate and bivariate comparisons analyses were performed. Using backwards logistic regression, we adjusted for difference in demographics, surgical characteristics, co-morbidities, and complications to identify independent predictors for readmission.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 70,843 patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery: 19.4% were under 50, 22.9% were 51 to 60, 25.5% were 61 to 70, 19.9% were 71 to 80, and 12.3% were over 80,.52.7% were women. Patients over 80 were primarily independent (90.2%) and had the longest length of stay (7 days, p&lt;0.01) compared to all other age groups. The most frequent operation in this cohort was partial colectomy (40.4%), followed by LAR/DLI (34.6%), ileocecectomy (18.3%), and total colectomy (4.2%). Almost half of all colectomies were performed laparoscopically (46.5%). Post-operative outcomes differed significantly based on age (Table 1). Overall SSI rate was 8.4% and was the lowest in patients &gt;80 years old (6.6%). Mortality rates increased with increasing age. Individuals under 50 had the highest readmission rate (12.3%) while individuals age 50-60 had the lowest (9.9%). In the fully adjusted model, patients under 50 years of age (OR 1.2 CI 1.1-1.3) and over 80 years of age (OR 1.14 CI 1.03-1.26) had a significantly higher chance of readmission.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients over 80 years and those under age 50 have the highest risk of readmission following elective colorectal surgery. Increasing age is also associated with increased mortality and increased hospital length of stay. As post-operative outcomes including readmission are being used as a quality metric, age of the patient undergoing the procedure should be considered.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient-Centered Outcomes","Cross Disciplinary"

We hypothesized this was related to EMR systems improving OR throughput and care transitions on the weekend. Our objective was to study how individual components of EMR systems contributed to overcoming the WE to test this hypothesis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This was a population-based cohort review using the 2011 Florida HCUP SID database and HIMSS Analytic database. We used prolonged weekend length of stay compared to the weekday at the hospital-level as a surrogate for the WE. Patients who underwent urgent/emergent surgical intervention at hospitals with the WE were propensity matched to patients at hospitals without the WE using patient (demographic, clinical) and hospital (case-mix, structural) characteristics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:2,841 patients comprised each matched group. EMR in the OR (O.R. 2.52, 95% C.I. [1.77, 3.60]) and electronic medication reconciliation (O.R. 2.43, 95% C.I. [2.10, 2.80]) were associated with overcoming the WE. Computerized physician order entry (O.R. 0.66, 95% C.I. [0.59, 0.75]), electronic bed management systems (O.R. 0.48, 95% C.I. [0.41, 0.55]), and electronic OR scheduling (O.R. 0.51, 95% C.I.

Variations in the index hospital costs among providers were compared using coefficient of variation (CV). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Among 4,114 patients, the overall unadjusted 30-day readmission rate was 17.2% varying by procedure (colorectal: 18.6% vs. pancreas: 18.6% vs. liver: 10.1%, P&lt;0.001). The mean cost of surgery during the index hospitalization was $33,809&plusmn;34,663 and varied by procedure (colorectal: $32,957 vs. pancreas: $37,360 vs. liver: $27,476, P&lt;0.001).

In surgery, despite anecdotes about enthusiastic adoption by providers, there is a lack of robust qualitative and quantitate data on the utilization of Twitter for professional use. Therefore, this study aims to identify surgical providers on Twitter and to analyze their usage patterns. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Individual tweets on surgical topics were pulled from Twitter from March 27<sup>th</sup> to April 27<sup>th</sup>, 2015 using a comprehensive list of surgery-related hashtags. Following this, the unique profiles of users who generated these tweets were identified. Further, key word matching was used to isolate those who self-identified (in profile ID/screen name/biography) as being involved in a surgical field. The Twitter profiles of these selected 'surgical providers' were analyzed to extract information on pre-determined themes. Data was extracted on multiple qualitative and quantitative fields, including: sex, location, user-type, affiliation, surgical specialty, multimedia use, followers/following, number of tweets, list membership and time on twitter. Standard descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the findings. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 17,783 surgery-related tweets were pulled in the study period from 7,713 unique users. Following this, 726 profiles (9.4%) were identified as 'surgical providers'. The cohort had a heterogeneous mix of user-type (surgeons/students/physicians/researchers/institutions) with varied affiliations (academic/community/private/non-profit/government) and specialties (general surgery/breast surgery/plastic surgery/orthopedics/surgical oncology/surgical health systems). The median time on twitter for profiles in this cohort was 40.7 months and ranged from 3 months to 8.5 years. Overall, a majority of the users were from North America (58.3%), followed by Europe (21.2%) and Asia (12.0%). This cohort had cumulatively tweeted 1,814,017 times; the median number of tweets per user was 625, with users tweeting as few as 8 and as many as 112,648 times. The median number of followers for a profile (334 [range: 7-142,580]) was similar to the number that they themselves followed (323 [range: 3-66,731]). Users were also members of a number of lists (median 11 [range: 0-3,672]) that are created based on common interests and topics that they tweet on. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Surgical providers on Twitter come from varied affiliations/specialties but are predominantly from developed countries in North America and Europe. Most profiles (71.1%) were created in the last 5 years, which may point to a growing understanding of the utility of this interface for building professional networks as well as for effective patient education. More in-depth content and network analyses are necessary to develop strategies for using social media to improve knowledge sharing, communication and collaboration between surgical providers, patients and patient advocates.","Outcomes/Clinical","Health Informatics","Cross Disciplinary"

The majority of participants were female, European and satisfied with their surgery and follow-up care.  Participants described positive and negative aspects of the surgery, their follow-up care and causes of weight regain.  Important emergent themes included the desire for more support delivered within the overarching principles of providing individualised and specialised care by providers that maintain good rapport and assist in maintaining motivation.  Furthermore, this follow-up support may be delivered in non-traditional ways rather than traditional face-to-face consultations. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:We conclude that individualised, innovative and sustainable care pathways are needed for our bariatric patients.","Outcomes/Clinical","Patient-Centered Outcomes","Cross Disciplinary"

North Americans aged 65 or older make up 15% of the population in 2015; this is projected to rise to 22% by 2050. Post-operative complications are associated with longer hospital stays, increased cost and lost independence. There is no data examining patients' accrued personal expenses and lost working days following emergency surgery discharge. This study will estimate the financial and social costs incurred by elderly post-operative patients following acute abdominal surgery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A prospective cohort of 73 patients 65 or older was enrolled in a study of post-surgical interventions to improve outcomes. The patients underwent acute abdominal surgery at either of the two level 1 trauma centers in Alberta, Canada, and completed a 6-month follow-up. Exclusion criteria were elective or palliative surgery, trauma, previous admission, or dependence for 3 or more activities of daily living. A detailed chart review gathered clinical and biochemical data. A validated health resource utilization inventory (HRU) was performed at a 6-month follow-up, which included questions on employment and medical products use. Participants were compared between sites to ensure demographic homogeneity using Fischer's exact tests or ANOVA. The cost of healthcare products used or purchased in the 6 months following discharge was estimated using government and commercial sources and our HRU. Multivariate linear regression assessed the association of age, preadmission care requirements, post-operative complications and readmission with post-discharge costs.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Mean age was 79.3 (SD 7.9). More than 98% were Caucasian (n=72); 68% were married; 67% were 3 or less on the Clinical Frailty Scale; and 77% were living independently without care. 62% were classified ASA 3 or 4 (n=45). Following discharge 35% required assistance with cleaning, 30% with shopping, 24% with laundry and meal preparation, 14% with finances and 8% lost employment hours. The mean health care expenditure was 797 Canadian dollars (SD $932, inter-quartiles $157, $1,142, max $4,547) in the 6 months following surgery. Post-discharge cost was associated with needing preadmission care (&beta; 0.313, CI 350-2330, p = 0.009,) as was age (&beta; 0.061, CI 3.7-9.6, p &lt; 0.001). Increased discharge costs were also associated with postoperative complication ($617, &beta; 0.356, CI $283-951, p &lt; 0.001), as was being readmitted ($524, &beta; 0.253, CI $44-1004, p = 0.03).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our data demonstrates the significant financial and social costs to patients upon discharge, with an estimated mean cost of $797 in the 6 months post-discharge. Complications pre- and post-discharge also increase out-of-pocket costs to the patient. Reducing complications will not only reduce costs during admission, but also reduce patients' costs following discharge.","Outcomes/Clinical","Geriatric Surgery","Cross Disciplinary"

Smith<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Pennsylvania,Neurosurgery,Philadelphia, PA, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Pennsylvania,Surgery,Philadelphia, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Patients with intracranial aneurysm (ICA) may be suitable for either surgical or endovascular repair. The limited generalizability of existing studies comparing the two treatment modalities underlines the importance of using observational data to delineate optimal standards of practice. The multi-institutional American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) is considered the best available data source for surgical outcomes research, yet its utility in evaluating care for patients with ICA is unclear. This study assesses whether the current form of the NSQIP is sufficient for analyses on ICA-specific procedures.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing surgical clipping (CPT codes 61697, 61698, 61700, 61702) or endovascular coiling (CPT 61624, 61635, 75894) of ICA was conducted using the ACS NSQIP participant use file 2006-2013. Prior to the analysis, a focus group of clinical experts was convened to identify significant preoperative and postoperative variables for ICA management. The availability of the data elements was tabulated. Univariate analysis using the chi-squared test was performed to compare patient, disease, and procedure characteristics. A multivariate logistic regression model was then developed to determine the factors associated with the primary outcome measure, 30-day combined death or stroke rate (30dDS).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 974 adult patients undergoing surgical clipping for ICA repair were identified for inclusion during the 8-year period. Zero entry of endovascular repair was found. A considerable number of potential risk factors (e.g. subarachnoid hemorrhage, ventriculostomy need, shunt need, family history of aneurysms, the Hunt and Hess grading, morphology, location, size, and number of aneurysms) and outcome measures (e.g. vasospasm, follow-up radiographic result, modified Rankin scale, Glascow outcome scale) were not available for analysis. For the clipping cohort, the overall 30dDS was 12.7% with 63 deaths and 80 strokes. In the multivariate model, only two variables&mdash;hypertension requiring antihypertensive medication and coma state prior to the operation&mdash;maintained significant association with higher risk of 30dDS (OR=2.4, 95% CI 1.2-5.1 and OR=6.8, 95% CI 2.2-22.8 respectively).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The study show that the current form of NSQIP is inadequate as data source for evaluating quality of ICA-related procedures. While a rudimentary outcomes study for surgical clipping of ICA is feasible, the database misses endovascularly treated patients and many variables of significant import to patients with ICA. To improve the utility of the database for this disease, the NSQIP might consider an ICA-specific pilot study including patients undergoing procedures outside of the operating room and making use of the expanded custom fields to capture the missing disease-specific risk factors and outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Understanding risk factors for and ultimately predicting readmission within this population could have significant clinical impact. We hypothesize that readmission rates following lower extremity bypass differ based on the indication for surgery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We queried the 2012-2013 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) procedure targeted vascular cohort to identify all patients who underwent lower extremity bypass. Patients were stratified by surgical indication: Aneurysm, Claudication, Critical limb ischemia rest pain, Critical limb ischemia tissue loss, or Other. Patients with a postoperative length of stay greater than 30 days or death within 30 days were excluded. Chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank Sums tests were used to determine the differences among categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The primary and secondary outcomes were unplanned readmissions and postoperative complications, respectively. Predictors of readmission were identified with logistic regression using a negative binomial model, and multivariable analysis was used to adjust the odds ratio of readmission for surgical indication.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the 4,676 lower extremity bypasses that were performed, 94.1% were elective and 5.1% were emergent. The cohort consisted of 65.2% males, 34.8% females, 72.2% whites, and 16.5% blacks. The overall 30-day readmission rate was 15.9%. Readmission rates varied significantly based on the indication for surgery. On unadjusted comparison, 20.2% of patients with tissue loss were readmitted compared to 16.8% with rest pain, 12.3% with aneurysms, and 9.8% with claudication (p&lt;0.0001). Unadjusted postoperative cardiac and respiratory complications as well as major bypass reinterventions varied significantly based on surgical indication (Table). Significant adjusted odds ratios of readmission were 1.617 for tissue loss versus claudication (p=0.0003) and 1.533 for rest pain versus claudication (p=0.0013). Several odds ratios for readmission based on adjusted predictors of readmission were significant for surgical indications (Table).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The risk for readmission after lower extremity bypass and postoperative complications vary significantly based on the surgical indication. All lower extremity bypasses are not performed for one diagnosis. If hospitals are to be penalized for high readmission rates, then the readmission rates following lower extremity bypass should be adjusted for surgical indication.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Intracerebral microembolization of atherosclerotic plaque of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is one of the major factors leading to increased cerebrovascular events and morbidity after minimally invasive and surgical carotid revascularization. Identification of specific demographic cardiovascular risk factors for increased microembolization can be useful in guiding decisions regarding choice and timing of procedure.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A total of 150 patients will be enrolled in this study. A preliminary analysis was done in 42 patients (male 74%; mean age 69.5) undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA, n=23) or carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS, n=19). The ipsilateral MCA was intraoperatively monitored for microembolic signals (MES) using transcranial Doppler.

We did not see any significant increase in average MES during CAS for patients positive for diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking history, and presence of stroke symptoms compared to patients negative for these risk factors. A positive trend towards higher MES rates in CEA patients with comorbidities compared to those without did not reach statistical significance probably due to lack of power. The study is ongoing and we are correlating this data with changes in neurocognitive status as detected by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the presence of micro-infarcts on cerebral DW-MRI.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Thus far, no national standard exists to guide for safely initiating pharmacologic prophylaxis of VTE after TBI.  We designed this study to survey the EAST members on their practice patterns regarding timing of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis after TBI.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Over 1 month, EAST members were emailed to participate in an online survey. Participants reported demographics, and responses to questions regarding VTE prophylaxis and timing of prophylaxis in 2 clinical scenarios of TBI. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The response rate was 30.9%. The majority of the participants were from Level 1 trauma centers and academic teaching hospitals.  Most respondents (75%) reported starting chemical VTE prophylaxis with a consensus between the neurosurgery and trauma/critical care services. While 76% of respondents reported experience of seeing pulmonary embolism without pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, only 44% witnessed progression of TBI after chemical VTE prophylaxis. About half of surgeons surveyed considered their practice of VTE prophylaxis in TBI patients to be conservative. Almost 50% reported no standardized protocol in their institutions.  While 1/3 of the members believed there are guidelines from EAST, another 1/3 were not aware of any guidelines available for VTE prophylaxis after TBI.  Responses to questions regarding timing of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in a hypothetical patient are shown in Figure. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Currently there is a substantial variation in the practice patterns among EAST members regarding timing of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in TBI patients.

Unlike in trauma, the transfusion patterns for massively transfused nontrauma patients have not been explored. However, most institutions have recently implemented identical transfusion protocols for both trauma and nontrauma patients. We hypothesized that distinct subpopulations of massively hemorrhaging patients exist based on patterns of product transfusion.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We used cluster-based modeling to characterize transfusion patterns in massively transfused trauma and nontrauma patients. Massively transfused nontrauma patients from a single institution were identified and classified into the following groups: cardiovascular (CV), gastroenterology (GI), transplant, and spine surgery. We identified distinct trajectories for product delivery and compared the distribution of patients in each trajectory by transfusion indication.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 363 patients were included for analysis, including 298 nontrauma patients.

Thirty day mortality among all patients who completed a 24 hour transfusion period was 27%. All patients received an average of 17 cumulative units of blood cells, 14 units plasma, and 14 units of platelets.Three distinct trajectories were extracted (Figure 1). Most trauma (85%) and cardiovascular surgery (63%) patients fit into trajectory 1, while most GI (57%) and transplant patients (63%) comprise trajectory 3. Trajectory 2 primarily consists of a subset of GI (29%) and transplant (31%) patients. The difference in distribution of patients in each trajectory is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.004). Three plasma and four platelet transfusion ratio trajectories were also extracted and exhibit similar variability.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We identified three patterns of product transfusion among all massively transfused patients. Trauma and cardiovascular patients are more likely to receive the majority of their blood products early, while GI and transplant patients receive products over a longer period of time. There is also a subset of GI and transplant patients that may not be adequately resuscitated during the initial attempts, ultimately leading to greater transfusion requirements. Future investigation into the impact of additional clinical characteristics on transfusion trajectories, as well as the effect of trajectories on patient outcomes, will allow us to more appropriately investigate and resuscitate this heterogeneous massive transfusion population.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Few studies have focused on whether the pattern of injury is different and if the protective benefit is the same in passengers when compared to riders. This study was designed to evaluate these differences in usage of helmets and subsequent patterns of injury between the riders and passengers of motorcycles.MethodsUsing 2007-2010 National Trauma Databank (NTDB), motorcycle trauma patients were identified by ICD-9 codes (Ecodes: E810-E819).  The injured patients were divided into two groups: motorcycle riders or passengers (fourth digit 2 and 3 respectively). Demographics, helmet use, injury severity, and outcomes including mortality, major complications, and length of hospital stay (LOS) were compared and contrasted. Major complications were defined as acute renal failure, ARDS, cardiorespiratory arrest, coma, pneumonia, sepsis, cerebrovascular accident, and surgical site infection.ResultsA total of 79,818 riders and 5,896 passengers were identified. Riders were more likely to be older (mean: 40.4 vs. 38.8 years), male (91.9% vs. 17.1%), obese (2.4% vs. 1.9%), and non-white (17.8% vs. 13.6%). They were also more likely to be under influence of drugs (51.2% vs. 47.5%). They were significantly more likely to wear helmet (66.2% vs. 57.5%). For riders, older age, white race, and female gender were associated with higher rates of wearing helmet. For passengers, the rate of helmet use was not associated with age and had reverse association with white race and female gender.The mean Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was similar between riders and passengers (mean: 13.2 vs. 13.1) however the Injury Severity Score (ISS) was slightly higher for the riders (mean: 12.9 vs. 13.7). The rate of major complications was significantly higher among the riders (8.1% vs 6.1%) even after adjusting for potential confounders. There were no significant differences in rates of mortality (4.6% vs 4.1%) and LOS between the riders and passengers. The unadjusted ICU admission rate was slightly higher for the riders (34.2% vs 32.7%). However, after adjusting for other potential confounders, the riders and passengers had no significant difference in rate of ICU admission.ConclusionsThis is one of the first studies to study demographics and outcomes of motorcycle passengers when compared to riders.  There is a very small protective effect in being a passenger when major complications are considered, but mortality, LOS, and ICU admissions were all similar.  Interestingly, while the outcomes are similar, the demographics of helmet use were different.  Being young, white, and female all were associated with being an unhelmeted passenger; these trends should be prospectively followed and intervened upon as changes in this population's behavior would yield significant life and quality of life dividends.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Odds ratios (OR), along with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.), were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis to adjust for confounders.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Among patients aged 18-20, non-whites (OR = 0.83, 95% C.I. 0.77-0.89), those with private insurance (OR = 0.71, 95% C.I. 0.66-0.77), and those receiving care in rural areas (OR = 0.67, 95% C.I. 0.60-0.75) were less likely to undergo operations at free-standing children's hospital than other hospitals. Patients undergoing elective operations (OR = 5.93, 95% C.I. 5.52-6.38), those living in the Midwest or West U.S. regions compared to the Northeast, and those with progressively higher APR-DRG severity scores were more likely to undergo operations at free-standing children's hospitals. Postoperative complications in this group of patients were more likely to occur when operations were performed at free-standing children's hospitals (OR = 1.68, 95% C.I. 1.41-1.99), were elective (OR = 1.62, 95% C.I. 1.44-1.82), or involved non-white patients (OR = 1.12, 95% C.I. 1.00-1.26). Payer status, rural hospital location and U.S. region did not appear to influence complication likelihood. Higher APR-DRG severity scores were associated with progressively higher odds of incurring postoperative complications.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Race/ethnicity, payer status, hospital location and APR-DRG severity scores may play a role in determining the type of hospital where young adult patients receive surgical care. Paradoxically, receiving care at a free-standing children's hospital may confer a higher risk of postoperative complications in this specific group as compared to care at other types of hospitals. Further stratification of patients by type of operation required or region of country may help direct resource utilization and improve outcomes. More work is needed to determine optimal delivery of care for patients who are poised for transition between pediatric and adult surgical services.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Frailty was defined as five or more of eight preoperative variables including functional status, ASA 4 or 5, hypoalbuminemia, heart failure, COPD, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and male gender. Ten surgical indications included acute or chronic diverticulitis, bleeding, cancer without or with obstruction, IBD (Crohn's or ulcerative colitis) enterocolitis, benign polyps or volvulus. Overall morbidity, serious morbidity and 30-day mortality were defined by ACS-NSQIP. Other known risk factors including age, BMI, race, emergent surgery and operative approach also were analyzed.  Univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression were performed in STATA 13.1.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of 29,219 patients undergoing colectomy, 2,077 (7.1%) were frail. The incidence of frailty varied from 1% for 1,994 Crohn's patients to 38% among 138 patients with enterocolitis.

Perioperative outcomes are thought to be volume-and surgeon-related. Therefore, using the NSQIP dataset, we examined effects of resident/trainee participation in Whipple procedures on mortality and morbidity.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The NSQIP database was queried for patients undergoing Whipple from 2008-2012. Data was categorized by resident participation (operation with resident versus attending only). Proportion of complications in each group was compared using chi-square test. Logistic regression model was built to analyze impact of multiple covariates on perioperative mortality within 30-days and first postoperative day. Data are presented as proportions and mean&plusmn;SD.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 12,104 Whipples were reported to NSQIP between 2008-2012.  After excluding cases with missing data on resident participation, 7,605 were available for analysis. These cases were divided into two groups: attending alone (group A, n=1105) versus attending with resident (group B, n=6500). Patient comorbidities and demographics were the same between the groups.  Operative time was increased with resident involvement (364&plusmn;139 vs. 380&plusmn;132 minutes, p&lt;0.001).  Length of stay was significantly decreased when residents were involved (13.7&plusmn;15 vs. 12.7&plusmn;12 days, p&lt;0.0001).  When comparing attending alone versus with resident, there was no significant difference in patient outcomes including incidence of renal failure (p&lt;0.0001), septic shock (p&lt;0.0001), reintubation (p&lt;0.0001), death on operative day (p&lt;0.0001), 30-day mortality (p&lt;0.0001), and readmission rates (p&lt;0.0001).  Resident participation was not a significant 30-day mortality predictor in unadjusted (OR=0.73; CI 0.51-1.04, p=0.087) or risk-adjusted models (adjusted OR 0.79; CI 0.55-1.14, p=0.22).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Resident involvement did not influence mortality and morbidity rates of Whipple procedure in this study. Resident participation is associated with longer operative time, but also significantly shortened hospital stay. Reduction in length of stay for this complex operation may reflect that, contrary to oft-reported criticisms in the literature, present-day residents are, in fact, taking 'ownership' of the patients under their care.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Rhoads<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Stanford University,Surgery,Palo Alto, CA, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of California - San Francisco,Surgery,San Francisco, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Soft tissue infections (STI) are common and may require extensive surgical debridement and critical care management. Inter-hospital transfer may occur due to perceived need for higher level of care for these patients. In trauma, cardiology and stroke care, inter-hospital transfers have demonstrated benefit; however, the role of transfers in STI outcomes is unclear. The purpose of the current study is to determine whether transferring patients with STI is associated with differences in care or outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Patients with STI were identified by ICD9 codes in the 2011 California patient discharge database. Transfers between facilities were identified using a unique record linkage number for each patient. Retrospective analysis compared length of stay (LOS), rate of surgical intervention, ICU admission, sepsis and death between transferred and non-transferred patients.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 39,820 patients identified with STI. Approximately 8% (3,311) were transferred from the original presenting facility and admitted to a different hospital. Patients who were transferred were younger than non-transferred patients (52.9 +/- 22.8 years vs. 55.2 +/- 20.9, p&lt;0.0001). Patients with &lsquo;other' insurance, including Indian Health Service and Tri-Care military insurance, were transferred at the highest rates (13.4%). About 9% of patients with public insurance (Medicare and Medicaid) were transferred. The lowest transfer rate was for patients with no insurance (3.3%). There was a lower rate of surgical intervention among transferred patients (22.5%) versus non-transferred patients (26%; p&lt;0.0001). Transferred patients had longer median LOS (4 vs. 3 days, p&lt;0.0001), but there were no differences in ICU care (0.33% vs. 0.53%, p=0.13), sepsis (0.45% vs. 0.67%, p=0.14), or inpatient death (0.42% vs. 0.33%, p=0.35).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Inter-hospital transfers are expensive and in the management of STI they are not associated with any clinical advantage in care or mortality. Early initiation of antibiotics at the presenting hospital might achieve similar outcomes with lower resource utilization.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

While many specific complications have been extensively studied, postoperative pneumonia has received relatively little attention.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a single-institution, IRB-approved retrospective analysis of patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or distal pancreatectomy (DP) from 2002 to 2014. Patient data were extracted from electronic medical records. Postoperative pneumonia was defined here as a radiographic finding of an infiltrate followed by antibiotic therapy. Pneumonia was further stratified by cause including ventilator-associated, aspiration, or community acquired. The incidence of post-pancreatectomy pneumonia, predictive factors, and its impact on post-operative outcomes were determined. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1526 patients underwent a pancreatectomy, including 1090 PDs (71%) and 436 DPs (29%). There were a total of 47 (4.3%) and 11 (2.5%) cases of pneumonia, respectively. The majority of the pneumonias were attributed to aspiration (87.2% and 81.8% in the two cohorts). Pneumonias were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification, and were more frequently severe (grades 4 or 5) in the PD group (55.3% vs 9.1% with DP, p=0.006). In the PD group, univariate predictors of postoperative pneumonia included male gender (odds ratio (OR) 2.7, p=0.003), age (OR 1.03, p=0.041), COPD (OR 5.0, p&lt;0.001), smoking history (OR 2.0, p=0.022), delayed gastric emptying (DGE, OR 10.3, p&lt;0.001), and persistent oxygen requirement on post-op day 3 (OR 4.4, p&lt;0.001). In a multivariate model, COPD (OR 3.2, p=0.036), DGE (OR 9.1, p&lt;0.001), and persistent oxygen requirement on post-op day 3 (OR 3.2, p=0.005) remained significant predictors. Pneumonia rates in patients who experienced ISGPS grades B and C DGE were particularly high (51.8%) compared with grade A or no DGE (8.67%, p&lt;0.001). In the PD group, postoperative pneumonia was associated with a prolonged length of stay (median 18 days, vs 7 days in the absence of pneumonia, p&lt;0.001) and an extremely high 90-day mortality (38.9% vs. 3.9% in the absence of pneumonia, p&lt;0.001). In a multivariate regression model of 90-day mortality after PD (Table 1), postoperative pneumonia was the most robust predictor of postoperative death (OR 24.1, p&lt;0.001). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pneumonia following PD is an uncommon but highly morbid event, with a substantially increased risk of death. Patients with pre-existing pulmonary disease are at increased risk, and severe DGE may lead to postoperative pneumonia due to an elevated aspiration risk. These data underscore the importance of cautious dietary progression and aspiration precautions in these individuals.?","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) Cohort Discovery Tool provides an easy to use, self-service way for researchers to query an externally maintained database that draws information from the electronic medical record, stored in the i2b2 Clinical Translational Research Informatics Data Warehouse (CTRI-CDW). Search criteria can include nearly any piece of information in the medical record from demographics, diagnoses and procedure codes, laboratory test results, pharmacy orders and dispenses, as well as free text within clinical documents. In response to a query, the tool can return an approximate number of patients matching the search criteria without revealing identifying information. Searches can be stored online and de-identified information is released after IRB approval.

However, little data exists that supports this practice. With the recent heavy emphasis on effective medical resource allocation, it is possible that this practice may be potentially eliminable. The objective of this study was to conduct a retrospective review for recurrence rates after enema reduction in children while in hospital, to examine the cost that is incurred by admission, and to examine whether post-reduction admission to hospital is necessary.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients aged 0-4 years old diagnosed with intussusception based on ICD-9 codes over the last twenty years at a single center pediatric hospital. Study included children 0-4 years of age who were treated for intussusception on first encounter with air contrast or barium enema that were subsequently admitted to the hospital for observation. Study excluded patients older than 4 years of age, those who were readmitted for recurrence after 48 hours, patients whose intussusception did not successfully reduce with enema on first try, and those who went to the operating room because of peritonitis on exam or perforation on enema. Early recurrence was defined as recurrence within 48 hours post-reduction.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 171 patients out of 272 met inclusion criteria. Out of 171 patients who were admitted to the hospital for observation post-reduction, only one experienced an early recurrence (0.6%).

Postoperative complications following VHR present patient morbidity and high cost to the medical system. Therefore, our aim was to determine if any correlation exists between preoperative co-morbid conditions and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing VHR.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A retrospective chart review of 304 patients who underwent VHR at UIHC from 2010-2011 was performed.  Multiple variables were investigated including the presence of ventral hernia recurrence, surgical site infection, readmission, and need for reoperation.  A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to examine potential effects of independent variables on postoperative outcomes.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  A history of smoking (OR=1.03, p=0.004) and prior surgical site infection (OR=2.88, p=0.02) were associated with a significant increase in surgical site infection following VHR.  Recurrence following VHR was significantly more likely in patients with a history of prior abdominal surgery (OR=1.31, p&lt;0.001).  A history of COPD increased the risk for second readmission following VHR (OR=11.9, p=0.02).  Prior surgical site infection (OR=3.33, p=0.002) and history of COPD (OR=3.32, p=0.03) were associated with a significant increase in reoperation following VHR.  (Table 1)<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  A preoperative diagnosis of COPD and a history of prior abdominal surgery, prior surgical site infection, and smoking all increase the risk for postoperative complications in patients who undergo VHR.

We hypothesize that children have better outcomes following falls than adults.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The 2007-2011 National Trauma Data Base (NTDB) was queried for ICD-9 code 882.0 ('fall from height'). Patients were divided into three age groups (0-4 years, 5-14 and 15+) for comparison. Continuous outcomes were compared using ANOVA and categorical outcomes using chi-square test. Multivariate logistic regression using covariates of vital signs at presentation, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Scale (ISS), and the need for an urgent operation was also performed to compare age groups.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 44,416 patients identified; of these, 82% of patients were male and 15% were children &lt;15 years of age. The mean age was 36.2 &plusmn; 20.1 years. ICU admission was required for 29% and urgent operation for 10%.  Infants and toddlers had a higher rate of closed head injury than adults (5% versus 3%, p&lt;0.001) and a concurrently higher ICU admission rate (45% versus 36%, p&lt;0.001).  The length of ICU stay (days), number of unplanned intubations, urgent operation rate, mortality, hospital length of stay (days), and ISS were all lower in children than adults (Table 1).  Presenting GCS and ISS were significant predictors of ICU admission and mortality in both children and adults (p&lt;0.001); however, vital signs on presentation were only predictive of these outcomes in the adult population (p=0.02).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Falls from heights are common in both children and adults.  Based on our review of the NTDB, children incur less severe injuries and have better overall outcomes than adults yet have a higher rate of ICU admission.  Abnormal vital signs at presentation may not be predictive of serious injury in children and may sometimes lead to over-triage for these patients.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Osterlind<sup>1</sup>, E. Dalton<sup>1</sup>, L. Hanley<sup>1</sup>, S. Ahmad<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Missouri,Surgery,Columbia, MO, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The management of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) has evolved from a primarily surgically managed disease to a medically managed one with advances in endoscopic therapies and treatment of H. pylori infection. While the incidence of hospital admissions for PUD may have changed over the decades, ulcer disease remains a significant cause for mortality, with perforation having a mortality of approximately 11-16%, and morbidity of approximately 30%. The incidence of acute perforation of PUD remains around 4-11 cases per 100,000/year and is the most common etiology for pneumoperitoneum identified on radiography. We utilized the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database Participant User File (PUF) to study preoperative, demographic and postoperative variables that may be associated with morbidity and mortality after emergent surgical management of acute perforated PUD.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The adult ACS-NSQIP database participant user files were queried from 2005 to 2013.  Those cases performed emergently with a postoperative diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease were extracted. Using SPSS, correlations were then derived between patient factors, postoperative complications, and survival.  P-values &lt;0.01 were considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We extracted 5666 emergent cases with a postoperative diagnosis of perforated PUD.  There were 723 deaths yielding a 30 day mortality rate of 12.8%.  The mean age of the study population was 61.  The most frequent postoperative complications were failure to wean from the ventilator within 48 hours (19.3%), need for blood transfusion (12.2%), septic shock (9.8%), and return to the operating room (9%).  Non-survivors were more likely to be female, older, have a higher ASA classification, be functionally dependent and receive surgical treatment later within the hospital stay (Table 1).  Females were more likely to be older, malnourished and receive transfusions despite a similar incidence of postoperative complications when compared to males.  In a multinomial logistic regression model the patient factors with the highest risk for mortality were post-operative cardiac arrest (OR 13.7, 95% CI 7.4-25.3), septic shock (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.9-5.7) and renal failure (OR 3.9, 95% CI 2.4-6.6). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:According to the NSQIP database, the mortality rate for emergent operations in perforated peptic ulcer disease was 12.8% which is consistent with prior studies.  Older and female patients are at higher risk of death.  This disease process appears to concentrate among older patients with a median population age of 61.  Earlier diagnosis and surgical intervention improves survival.  Poor nutritional status and certain post-operative complications may decrease the likelihood of survival.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

This study explored the use of SBAR for handoffs between surgical team members 6 years after implementation in a large tertiary care center.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Healthcare systems engineering researchers observed 23 operative procedures in June 2015. Case duration, presence and duration of handoffs, were recorded for the following participants - circulating registered nurses (RN), certified surgical technicians (CST), certified surgical assistants (CSA), and anesthesia providers including certified registered nurse anesthetist and anesthesiologists (CRNA/ANES).  To evaluate the use of SBAR during handoffs, a binary approach to determine existence or nonexistence of each SBAR component (S, B, A, R) was applied and analyzed using nonparametric statistics. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 23 procedures (M = 219 min, SD = 92), 20 included at least one handoff during the operative procedure. Within these 20 cases, 127 handoffs were observed of which 119 could be assessed for SBAR use. CSAs performed fewer handoffs (10%) than CSTs (26%), anesthesia providers (30%) and RNs (34%) (p=0.0014). Of the 119 handoffs (M = 61sec, SD = 52), 90% included information about the patient's situation, 58% discussed clinical background, 64% provided an assessment and 55% made a recommendation. SBAR components included in each handoff varied significantly by the role involved; specifically differences exist between CRNA/ANES and CSAs when evaluating use of 'B' (p=0.032), 'A' (p=0.048) and average number of SBAR factors included (p=0.043).  When the core team member present at the start of the case handed off, information about the situation was included in 94%, background in 69%, assessment in 68% and recommendation in 68% of handoffs. The average number of SBAR factors used differed by who provided the  handoff (original &rarr;relief, relief &rarr;original, relief &rarr;relief) (p=0 .0018), driven by the use of 'B'.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This pilot study suggests that in a busy OR a handoff by a team member may occur every 35 minutes and adoption of the SBAR structure during surgical procedures differs by role and situation. Team members adjusted for prior knowledge (e.g. 'B') by the core team. The study was not scoped to investigate the effect of surgeon briefings on the differential use of SBAR or the effect of differential use of SBAR on the occurrence of non-routine events.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether post-operative UTI is an independent risk factor for subsequent SSI.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Using data from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative, we identified 30,727 patients undergoing colon resection within 73 hospitals between 2008 and 2015.  We evaluated the independent effect of an initial postoperative UTI on the incidence of SSI using multivariate logistic regression adjusting for patient demographic, clinical, and case-specific Surgical Care Improvement Program (SCIP) process compliance. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In our study cohort, 1.2% of patients developed a postoperative UTI and 10.0% developed a postoperative SSI. Unadjusted rates of SSI were higher in patients with an initial post-operative UTI (22.7% v. 9.9% p&lt;0.01). In multivariate models, post-operative UTI was an independent risk factor for the development of SSI (OR 3.35, 95% CI 2.50-4.48).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Post-operative UTI is an independent risk factor for the development of SSI after colectomy.

Patients who were managed with an exploratory laparotomy without a prior CT or DL were excluded. The remaining patients were stratified into two groups based on the initial management of the suspected AL, CT versus DL. The sensitivities of the two diagnostics were compared as well as the outcomes, including: length of stay (LOS), SICU admission/LOS, 30-day mortality, requirement for a 2<sup>nd</sup> reoperation, and readmission. The groups were compared using the Fisher's exact test and &chi;<sup>2</sup> for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for continuous variables. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 184 patients who suffered ALs and met our inclusion criteria were identified.

Recurrent laryngeal nerves are thin, about 1 to 2mm in size. In this study, we hypothesized that thin recurrent laryngeal nerve may affect postoperative vocal cord paralysis. We evaluated relations of left recurrent laryngeal nerve size and postoperative left vocal cord paralysis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   This follow-back study included a total of 44 patients who underwent thoracoscopy assisted esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy along the recurrent laryngeal nerve from May 2012 to December 2013. When we exposed recurrent laryngeal nerves, we used single use scissor tips (Microline Surgical, Inc.). Diameter of the nerves were measured using the digital video recording of surgical procedures by the ratio between scissor and left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Median size of left recurrent laryngeal nerve for the 44 patients was 1.51mm. To evaluate relations of left recurrent laryngeal nerve size and postoperative vocal cord paralysis we compared patients with thin nerve and those with thick nerve. Twenty two patients had left recurrent laryngeal nerves under 1.5mm in size (thin group) and 22 patients had the nerves over 1.5mm (thick group). The average age was 63.2 years old (a range of 35-78), and 34 men and 10 females were included.

Our goal is to determine if compliance with ATA guidelines for thyroidectomy for Graves' disease is associated with better outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed to identify 228 patients with Graves' Disease who underwent a total thyroidectomy between August 2007 and May 2015. Data was then extracted including patient demographics and clinical characteristics and treatment-related morbidity. Patients were considered to be in compliance with the ATA guidelines if they were treated pre-operatively with SSKI and were either rendered euthyroid with methimazole (T4&lt;1.5 ng/dl) or if that was not feasible were treated with a &beta;-Blocker. Analysis of these data was performed using Stata v11 statistical software.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The mean age of all patients in our study was 39 &plusmn; 1 years and 82% were female. The majority of patients were treated with methimazole (84%) and &beta;-blockers (54%). All patients underwent a total thyroidectomy, and the mean OR time was 114 &plusmn; 3 minutes and mean estimated blood loss (EBL) was 45 &plusmn; 7 mL. About one third of patients (36%) had a complication following thyroidectomy. Transient hypocalcemia was the most common complication (27%). At the time of surgery, 52% of all patients were found to be in compliance with the ATA guidelines. Patients that were not prepped according to the ATA guidelines had more intraoperative tachycardia (episodes of heart rate exceeding 120) (0.3 vs. 4.6, p = 0.05), but thankfully had no difference in peak SBP (p = 0.64) or in number of episodes of SBP &gt;180 (p=0.31). ATA prepped and non-prepped patients had similar EBL (45.9 vs. 47.3 mL, p = 0.93), mean OR time (113.1 vs. 117.4 minutes, p = 0.45), and length of stay (0.6 vs. 0.7 days, p = 0.46).

Velasco<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Northshore University Health System,Skokie, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for acute cholecystitis in the elderly has proven to be safe, however it has not been universally adopted.  In spite of published guidelines, percutaneous cholecystostomy or delayed LC with antibiotic treatment has been increasingly utilized as the initial step in the management of these patients. In this era of fiscal scrutiny, specific cost benefits of early LC have not been well examined, particularly in the elderly. This study examines whether early LC in the elderly results in efficient and effective care when compared to alternative management approaches.   <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective chart review of patients admitted to a four-hospital single university affiliated health system from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011 was completed.   Patients older than 65 with histologically documented acute cholecystitis were selected. Eligible patients (237) were distributed into three groups based on initial treatment of cholecystitis: early LC within 7 days, delayed LC, or percutaneous cholecystostomy.  Patient charges, including diagnostic tests, pharmacy and consultation fees, length of stay, and number of hospital admissions were compared between groups.  Statistical analysis was completed by ANOVA allowing comparison of the means of the three patient groups.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Patients who underwent an early LC had an average LOS just over six days totalling appoximately $50,000 in charges, while those who had delayed cholecystectomies were admitted for two days longer with charges totalling approximately $70,000.  The percutaneous group had stays significantly longer averaging two weeks with charges totalling over $100,000.  Patients who underwent a delayed management strategy had a higher rate of recurrent events, requiring more interventions that resulted in a statistically significant cost increase. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy completed within 7 days of presention is the most cost-effective treatment for acute cholecystitis in the elderly.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Robie<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Mayo Clinic - Florida,Surgery,Jacksonville, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The separation of conjoined twins requires thorough preoperative assessment, detailed operative planning, optimization of each twin's medical status and multidisciplinary team preparation.  Since each set of conjoined twins is unique and the condition is extremely rare, both surgeon and institutional experience will be limited.  Our recent experience in separating omphalopagus conjoined twins highlighted the importance of these preparatory steps.   The purpose of this review is to identify the key prognostic indicators that impact on survival.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: PUBMED was searched for publications on conjoined twin separations and operations performed between 1988 and 2015 were included in this review.  Data gathered included type of conjoining; age at operation; whether emergent or elective separation; if emergent the primary indication for surgery; complexity of organ sharing; mortality and cause of death; survival.  Significance of categorical variables on survival was determined using univariate analysis and the mean and median time to the separation operation determined. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 109 separations reviewed.  Type of conjoining and % of total as follows: Omphalopagus (OP) 51 (47%), Thoracopagus (TP) 25 (23 %), Ischiopagus (IP) 22 (20%), Parapagus (PP) 5 (5%), Pygopagus (PGP) 4 (4%) and Craniopagus (CP) 2 (2%).  Elective separation, survival and age at separation (range; median and mean in months (ms)): 29 OP sets (1 d to 12 ms, 1.25 ms, 3.6 ms) with 95% survival, ; 13 TP sets (1 m to 16ms, 4.5 ms, 6.3 ms) with 81% survival, 20 IP sets (1d to 26 ms, 10.5 ms, 12 ms) with 92.5% survival.  Emergency separation and survival: 22 OP sets with 54% survival, 13 TP sets with 29% survival, 2 IP sets with 25% survival.  Causes of death in total group(n): planned sacrifice 1, dependent parasite 2, severe congenital heart disease 13, pulmonary 7, sepsis 9, other 9 and unknown 7.  Seven infants died intraoperatively and 7 died preoperatively.   Indication for emergency separation and % survival; preop twin demise 7 sets (43%), clinical deterioration of one or both twins 16 (24%).  26 infants had severe congenital heart disease (5 with cardiac fusion) with 19 % survival.  Predictors of adverse outcome;  TP type, emergency separation, preoperative twin demise and presence of severe congenital heart disease.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Survival following separation of conjoined twins is dependent on the type of conjoining, emergency versus elective separation, the presence of severe cardiac anomalies and the immediate condition of the infants prior to surgery.  When time allows, efforts should be focused on maximizing the clinical condition of the infants prior to separation.  It is important that the treatment team and the family are aware of the prognosis based on the unique aspects of the individual set of twins.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Therefore this study aimed to determine bodyweight (BW) change following total thyroidectomy (TTx), and comparing perceived to actual changes. Secondarily, the study also aimed to determine patient satisfaction regarding thyroxine dosing post-operatively. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Following institutional review board ethics approval, patients were recruited from the Monash University Endocrine Surgery Database between January 2013 and June 2014. All patients who underwent TTx at the Alfred Hospital were eligible. Pre-operative data were extracted from patient files (including BW, TSH, medications), while post-operative data were obtained by surveying the participants 6 to 18 months after surgery (including BW, medications, satisfaction scores). Clinically relevant change in BW was defined as 2 kg gain or loss. Data was analysed using standard statistical methods, including Student's t-test, Chi-squared, and Fisher's Exact tests as appropriate.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 107 patients satisfying the inclusion criteria were invited to participate, and were posted the questionnaire. A response was received from 79 patients (74%). The mean age of the respondents was 56 (range 15 &ndash; 84) years, with 3 times more females than males. The majority of participants had TTx for benign indications, and 19% had TTx for confirmed or suspected malignancy. Pre-operatively, 32 (42%) patients had a diagnosis of either toxic multinodular goiter or Graves' disease, and 28 of them were on an anti-thyroid medication. Nearly half (34, 43%) of the participants had stable BW after TTx, while 24 (30%) gained an average of 6.8 kg (9% gain), and 21 (27%) lost an average of 7.8 kg (9.3% loss). There was poor concordance between perceived and actual BW gain or loss. Pre-operative thyrotoxicity did not appear to have any bearing on post-operative BW change. Anti-thyroid medications, gender and TSH levels were also not shown to be predictors of post-operative BW change. Taking their BW and thyroxine dosing into account, the majority of patients (81%) were satisfied with their post-operative management. There was no correlation between satisfaction scores and BW gain or loss. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Bodyweight change following TTx is unpredictable, and only less than one-third of patients experience weight gain.  Pre-operative factors, including thyrotoxicosis, were not found to be predictors of post-operative BW change after thyroidectomy. Regardless of their BW status, the majority of patients were satisfied with their post-operative course after total thyroidectomy.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Patients were classified as having Crohns disease (CD) based upon ICD-9 codes (555.9, 555.2, 555.1).  Demographics, pre-operative co-morbidities, minor and major complications were evaluated using standard statistical methods.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 637 patients in the sample; 23 patients with the diagnosis of CD and 614 without CD.

If they are acutely toxic or they have a prolonged QTc interval on their electrocardiogram (EKG) the surgery is canceled unless it is an absolute emergency.The electronic medical records (EMR) were retrospectively reviewed for the years 2003-2014. Patients who underwent a surgical procedure whose urine toxicology screening was positive for cocaine were included.  Only patients with a positive test on the same admission prior to the surgical procedure were included. Patients who did not receive general anesthesia were excluded. Patient demographics and the 30 day cardiovascular and neurological complications were collected and analyzed<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 146 patients in total. After excluding the procedures without general anesthesia, there were 81 patients that were analyzed. There were 53 males and 28 females. The median age was 47 years (18-69 years).  21 procedures were elective and 60 were admitted through the emergency department. There were 54 general surgery cases, 8 orthopedic cases, 4 gynecologic, and 3 each of vascular, otolaryngology, dental, neurosurgical and urology cases.Cardiovascular complications were noted in 4 patients (2 arrhythmias, non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and exacerbation of congestive heart failure) while neurological complications were seen in 2 patients (seizure and cerebrovascular accident). There was one mortality. The complications were reviewed and in most cases attributable to the illness and not cocaine (e.g. mortality after craniotomy for severe hemorrhagic stroke). The two arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia) and the NSTEMI were the only ones possibly attributable to cocaine, and all three of these patients had other pre-existing cardiac comorbidities that could have contributed as well.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:A positive urine test for cocaine is not an absolute contraindication to surgery. In patients who are not acutely toxic and without a prolonged QTc interval, complications do not appear to significantly exceed that which would be expected in the population at large.

Fourier analysis of the monthly data was performed to detect periodic patterns in the data, a signal processing technique that is historically employed in areas of physics and engineering, and is a way of expressing a function (in this case, hospital admissions over time) as a sum of sinusoids. Comparison of sinusoid amplitudes (signal versus noise) allowed us to discern dominant cyclical patterns.  Our findings were further confirmed with linear regression analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 75,585 patients admitted emergently with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Unadjusted analysis of the data demonstrated a trend towards increasing number of annual cholecystitis admissions. Fourier transform analysis detected a strong signal with cycle length of 12 months (coefficient ratios of 3.78 and 2.88 for unsmoothed and smoothed periodogram respectively). This annual cycle peaked in August (mean of 756.33 admissions), and was lowest in February (mean of 632.67 admissions). Linear regression confirmed that months July &ndash; October were associated with higher number of admissions, with the lowest coefficient in February (-50.89, p&lt;0.001) and the highest coefficient in August (72.78, p&lt;0.001) relative to January (figure). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:A seasonal pattern exists in the incidence of acute cholecystitis, with peaks in the Fall.

It is a global epidemic with approximately 33% of adults being obese. Obesity both directly and indirectly leads to increases in health care expenditures and resources. Increased consumption of surgical services by obese patients compared to their non-obese counterparts for routine general surgery procedures has been analyzed. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and the time required to complete standard tasks in the operating room during elective cholecystectomy and to identify the financial impact.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Our study investigated operative time differences in different BMI groups. Comparisons of continuous variables according to dichotomized BMI were done using a two group t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while one way analysis of variance or Kruskal Wallis test was used to compare continuous variables according to multi categorical BMI. Linear regression models were developed for all three outcome variables (operating room, anesthesia and surgery times) using multi-category BMI as the main exposure adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, number of comorbidities, airway type and smoking history. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We included 2068 patients in our study, 1037 patients with BMI&lt;30 and 1025 patients with BMI&ge;30. The data was further classified according to the WHO obesity classification. The average operating room, anesthesia and surgery times (in minutes) for BMI&lt;25 were 114.4, 124.6, 81.3 respectively and for BMI&ge;40 were 134.3, 140.5, 96.2. The times of all three outcome variables were significantly different between the two groups with P-values &lt; 0.001. BMI, age, gender and ethnicity continued to be significant in all the final models.

However, there is a paucity of information on racial differences in the management of benign thyroid disorders. We sought to determine whether racial disparities exist in the etiology, presentation, and management of hyperthyroid patients prior to surgical intervention.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective chart review of a prospectively collected database was performed of hyperthyroid patients who underwent thyroidectomy at a single institution from 01/2009 to 02/2014. Data collected included patient demographics, etiology of hyperthyroidism, type and duration of hyperthyroid symptoms (unintentional weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, anxiety, emotional lability, tremor, muscle weakness and eye symptoms), thyroid hormone levels, and use of antithyroid medications and radioactive iodine prior to surgery. Racial differences for etiology, presentation, and pre-surgical management were examined by chi-square or Kruskal-Wallis test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 191 patients, the majority (73%) were white; 18% (n=34) were black and 9% (n=17) other or unknown races. The most common etiologies of hyperthyroidism were Graves' disease (51%), toxic multinodular goiter (34%), and toxic thyroid nodule (10%). There was no difference in the etiology of hyperthyroidism by race. At least one symptom was reported in 159 (83%) patients. By race, there was no difference in the presence of reporting at least one symptom, the presence of each of the eight symptoms, the maximum duration of symptoms, or the median duration of each symptom, except for heat intolerance. The median duration of heat intolerance was longer in the non-white patients (10 months in Blacks and 13 months in other races) compared to three months in white patients (p=0.03). The total number of symptoms per patient differed by race; non-white patients reported more symptoms than white patients (4-4.5 vs. 3; p=0.03). There was no difference in preoperative TSH or free T4 values by race. Prior to surgery, 135 (71%) patients received antithyroid medication; there was no difference in receipt or duration of medication by race. Only 14 (7%) patients received radioactive iodine treatment prior to surgery; there was no difference by race.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this cohort of largely white patients, we found no racial differences in the etiology of hyperthyroidism, presence and duration of symptoms, biochemical level of disease, and preoperative management, except the findings that non-white patients reported longer duration of heat intolerance and presented with more symptoms than white patients. Prospective studies in larger, more racially diverse populations that include hyperthyroid patients who are managed either medically or surgically are needed.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Noninvasive imaging studies (NIIS) such as ultrasound, sestamibi scan, SPECT and magnetic resonance imaging are less sensitive in this setting. 4-dimensional cat scan (4DCT), a relatively new imaging method, is superior to other NIIS in localizing parathyroid disease but is not widely available. In such scenarios, selective venous sampling (SVS) may be useful for operative planning. We present the results of SVS in a cohort of NIIS-negative patients with persistent or recurrent disease.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: RPS patients enrolled in our institutional prospective endocrine surgery registry from 1997 to 2013 were identified for inclusion in the study. Patients with positive localization by NIIS were excluded from the study. Study patients underwent SVS followed by parathyroid exploration with intra-operative PTH monitoring. SVS results were classified as non-localized, lateralized (identification of the correct side of the abnormal gland) or localized (identification of the correct side and position of the abnormal gland) through an assessment of intra-operative findings and pathologic review. Descriptive statistics were performed. Test characteristics were calculated.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We identified 165 patients with recurrent/persistent disease necessitating surgical intervention. Of the surgical candidates, 19 patients had negative NIIS and were referred for SVS. The sensitivity of lateralization by SVS was 95% (18/19). The sensitivity of localization by SVS was 44.4% (8/18). The final diagnosis was adenoma in 15 patients, hyperplasia in 3 patients and parathyroid carcinoma in 1 patient. Immediate cure was achieved in 88.9% of patients. Long-term cure was achieved in 15/19 (78.9%) patients, among those who lateralized the cure rate was 14/18 (77.8%). Interestingly, cure was not achieved in 2/8 patients who were localized by SVS. One had parathyroid cancer metastatic to left lower neck and the other had multigland hyperplasia.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:SVS is a useful test for the preoperative localization of abnormal parathyroid glands when other NIIS fail. Despite SVS results, the long-term cure rate in this population remains substantially lower than that reported for initial surgical candidates. SVS is especially important in reoperative cases when 4- dimensional CT is not locally available.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

After neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT), CT and PET scan are often used over EUS for re-staging due to post-treatment fibrosis and inflammation that may make EUS staging inaccurate. The aim of this study was to compare EUS staging and pathologic staging in patients who underwent induction therapy prior to esophagectomy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We queried our IRB-approved prospective foregut database to identify a total of 26 patients from 2001 to 2015 who underwent post-induction EUS re-staging for locally advanced esophageal cancer. EUS post-induction stage was compared to pathologic stage. EUS nodal status was determined by nodal morphology and size and not by biopsy.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The majority of patients (n=24, 92.3%) were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. The average age was 58 years old (range: 41-77 years). Most patients (n=22 patients, 84.6%) were male. EUS over-staged tumors for the majority of patients (n=12, 46.2%). It correctly staged 26.9% (n=7) of patients and understaged 26.9% (n=7) of patients. Tumor size (T) was most often overestimated (n=13, 50.0%), as compared to being correctly estimated in 26.9% (n=7) of patients and underestimated in 23.1% (n=6) of patients.

The quality of care transitions has been assessed for complex inpatient medical and surgical patients but has never been evaluated for outpatient surgery. The purpose of this study was to use a validated transitions instrument to determine how well patients were being prepared for outpatient surgery at an academic hospital. We hypothesized that our extensive preoperative education and patient support services would result in excellent preparation for surgery and would be reflected by high scores on the instrument.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We administered the Care Transitions Measure (CTM), a validated assessment of care transition quality, to patients undergoing outpatient endocrine surgery. The survey measures patient comprehension of medications, treatment and discharge plans. Participants were surveyed at three time points: the pre-operative clinic visit, after surgery on the day of discharge, and at the post-operative clinic visit. The primary endpoint was CTM score at each time point. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We approached 110 patients and 92 (84%) agreed to participate. Mean CTM scores for complex medical and surgical inpatients typically range from 65-70 on a 100 point scale, but our patients had considerably higher scores at all time points (Figure).  After the initial clinic visit, mean CTM was 89 &plusmn; 2. After surgery, CTM scores remained high with a mean of 92 &plusmn; 1.7 on the day of surgery and 90 &plusmn; 2 at the postoperative visit, though none of the differences was statistically significant.

Prior studies have demonstrated mixed results regarding the role of intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) in preventing recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of IONM on recurrent laryngeal nerve injury during thyroidectomy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective cohort study was performed on patients undergoing thyroidectomy performed by a single surgeon over a 6-year period beginning in 2009 (n=627). Routine intraoperative monitoring was implemented in 2012 and was used in a cohort of 315 consecutive patients. The recurrent laryngeal nerve was routinely identified and traced through its entire course in all patients and the IONM was used solely to confirm the functional integrity of the nerve throughout its dissection.  The rate of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury was compared to a cohort of 312 consecutive patients who underwent thyroidectomy during the 3-year period immediately prior to implementation of IONM. Secondary analysis was performed to determine if there was a relationship between nerve injury and patient age, sex, substernal thyroid extension, central neck dissection, re-operative neck surgery, nodule size, thyroid gland weight, or pathology. Subgroup analysis was performed for patients with malignant pathology, substernal thyroid extension, re-operative neck surgery, and central neck dissection.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the 627 patients who underwent thyroidectomy, 7 (1.1 %) had a recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. There was no correlation between the use of the IONM and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.  Of the 531 nerves at risk in the cohort with IONM, 4 (0.75 %) were injured compared to 3 injuries (0.58 %) among the 517 nerves at risk in the cohort without IONM (p&gt;0.05). No secondary measures demonstrated a statistically significant relationship with recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.

Bariatric surgery results in significant weight loss and post-operative improvements in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). There is a paucity of data on the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in improving eGFR among African American patients. We hypothesize that bariatric surgery is associated with improved post-operative kidney function among African Americans.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent bariatric surgery (roux-en-y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy) between 2008 and 2013. We measured pre- and post-operative BMI and eGFR. Post-operative values were recorded 6 months following surgery. The eGFR was estimated by calculating creatinine clearance (CKD-EPI equation used), and a range of 90-125 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> was considered normal. We categorized patients into three BMI categories - &lsquo;35 &ge; BMI &lt; 40', &lsquo;40 &ge; BMI &lt; 50' and &lsquo;BMI &ge; 50'. We compared pre-operative eGFR to the post-operative values for patients with glomerular hyperfiltration (stage I CKD) and patients at CKD stages II-IV. We also analyzed the proportion of patients whose CKD condition improved to a less severe stage post-operatively.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The results include 160 patients whose mean age at the time of surgery was 43.0 years. The overall mean eGFR was 104.6 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> prior to surgery and rose to 110.0 post-operatively (p &gt; 0.05). The mean BMI reduced from 49.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> pre-operatively to 38.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> post-operatively (p &lt; 0.0001). Of the 160 patients, 28 had glomerular hyperfiltration (eGFR &gt; 125) and 40 had stages II-IV CKD (eGFR 15-90) prior to surgery. The patients with stage I CKD had a mean pre-operative eGFR of 133.3, which reduced to 125.3 post-operatively (p = 0.0036). Among CKD stage I patients only those in the &lsquo;40 &ge; BMI &lt; 50' BMI category encountered significant reduction in eGFR from 135.3 to 125 (p = 0.0258).

The clinical presentation of the disease often mimics breast cancer.  There is no consensus on the best treatment and methods range from observation and antibiotics to systemic steroids and mastectomy. Our objective was to determine if conservative management of granulomatous mastitis without steroids and definitive surgery provides effective management for this disease.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of institutional records of Highland Hospital in Oakland, California of all patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of granulomatous mastitis from June 2005 though July 2015.  Demographic, clinical and outcomes data were analyzed using summary statistics.  We defined definitive surgery as mastectomy, lumpectomy or excisional biopsy.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 46 women with granulomatous mastitis were identified.  The mean age was 33.9 (range 24 &ndash; 55 years).  62.2% of women received conservative management with 85% resolution. This includes 22.2% who received only core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration (88.9% resolution) and 40% who received incision and drainage (86.7% resolution).  35.6% received excisional biopsy.  68.8% of patients undergoing excisional biopsy also had a BIRADS 4 or higher reading on ultrasound or mammogram.   91.7% of patients with excisional biopsy had resolution of symptoms.  A single patient (2.2%) received steroids after failed conservative management and continued to be symptomatic.  Conservative management was successful in 87.5% of cases. The mean duration of follow up was 11.8 months (range 1 week to 45 months). Significantly, 91.3% of patients with granulomatous mastitis were Hispanic. Approximately 30% of our hospital patients are Hispanic.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Conservative management with interventions limited to aspiration, incision and drainage and antibiotics is frequently effective in the management of granulomatous mastitis.  However, the radiologic and clinical presentation can mimic breast cancer, and excisional biopsy is often required to rule out a diagnosis of malignancy.  Patients treated without steroids had recovery rates comparable to treatment with steroids reported in the literature.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Surgery is recommended for most complicated cases of diverticulitis.  The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of patients with and without diverticular disease following colorectal surgery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Review of the Carolinas Medical Center (CMC) NSQIP data for colorectal procedures performed from 2013 to 2015 was conducted.  Patients were considered to have or had had diverticulitis based upon ICD-9 codes (562.11, 562.13).  Demographics, pre-operative co-morbidities, minor and major complications were evaluated using standard statistical methods.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 637 patients in the sample; 109 patients had the diagnosis of diverticulitis, 528 with other diagnoses, including neoplasms (63.2%), IBD (2.7%), infectious disease (3.2%), ischemia (4.7%) and obstruction (6.1%).  There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, race, gender or other medical co-morbidities.  Those with diverticulitis underwent laparoscopic surgery more often (75.2% vs 63.5%; p=0.02) than those with other diagnoses.  However, those without the diagnosis of diverticulitis tended to have a higher rate of pre-operative steroid use (8.9% vs 1.8%; p=0.01), a higher rate of pre-operative transfusions (7.4% vs 1.8%; p=0.03) and a greater chance of pre-operative weight loss of &ge; 10 pounds (5.5% vs 0.9%; p=0.04).  The proportion of emergent cases were similar between the 2 groups (10.1% vs 11.3%; p=0.59). Those with the diagnosis of diverticulitis had a lower rate of post-operative transfusions (3.7% vs 21.8%; p&lt;0.001) and a shorter post-operative length of stay (6.7&plusmn;5d vs 10.3&plusmn;9.6d; p&lt;0.001).    After controlling for pre-op transfusions, ASA class and pre-op sepsis, multivariate analysis indicated patients with diverticulitis required fewer post-op transfusions with OR 0.17 (95% CI 0.06, 0.49) and had a shorter LOS (adjusted mean13.4d vs 15.3d; p=0.02).  There were no significant differences in post-operative surgical site infections, pneumonia, UTIs, sepsis, anastomotic leaks, unplanned returns to the OR, cardiac or renal disease, DVTs/PEs and 30 day mortality between the 2 groups.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients with and without diverticulitis had similar demographic characteristics and pre-operative co-morbidities.  Those with diverticulitis required fewer transfusions, both pre and post-operatively.  They also had a shorter length of stay and did not require more emergent surgeries compared to those without diverticulitis.  Surgery, including laparoscopy, can be performed on those with colorectal diverticular disease with similar outcomes to those requiring surgery for other reasons.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Decisions regarding transfer can be particularly challenging for gravely ill surgical patients, for whom transfer may be arduous and of questionable clinical benefit. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted semi-structured interviews with general surgeons who refer and accept transfer patients within a regional transfer network. Participants were identified using a combination of snowball sampling, where initial study subjects were asked to identify additional subjects, and purposive sampling where respondents were selected deliberately to increase variability. Surgeons were selected from three community hospitals that refer patients, three regional hospitals that both refer and accept, and one tertiary referral center that accepts transfer patients. We completed 15 audio-recorded interviews that included open-ended questions and three case-based vignettes. Each interview transcript was analyzed by at least two members of the research team using a deductive coding strategy. We used consensus coding to generate higher level analysis about the content regarding surgeon transfer decisions for gravely ill patients with acute surgical problems. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Referring surgeons seek transfer when they identify discordance between patient needs and local resources. When patients are gravely ill, transfer decisions are influenced by clinical uncertainty and a duty to exhaustively pursue treatment options based on surgeon judgement or family request. Accepting surgeons at regional facilities consider local resources, patient ownership, and expected benefit in their decisions to accept patients. Tertiary facility surgeons report a policy to accept all transfer patients based on a perceived responsibility to the region and difficulty making treatment recommendations without in-person assessment, but they express concern that dying patients may be unnecessarily transferred without survival benefit or adequate discussion of local palliative options. Palliative care and expertise in end-of-life communication may be uniquely available in higher level centers, although respondents were conflicted about the appropriate allocation of limited resources, specifically bed availability, for dying transfer patients.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Current policies and practices may fail to identify dying patients who will not benefit from transfer. Remote consultation, cultural shifts in end-of-life communication, and access to palliative care at community hospitals could provide needed support to surgeons, patients, and families while allocating scare tertiary care beds more judiciously.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Ahuja<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>York Hospital,Surgery,York, PA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:   Obesity is commonly associated with a myriad of psychosocial conditions. However, the effects of these conditions in patients undergoing bariatric surgery is relatively understudied.  The purpose of this study was to 1) identify psychosocial conditions in bariatric surgery patients, 2) assess changes in weight and psychosocial variables before and after bariatric surgery, and 3) identify psychosocial predictors of successful bariatric procedures at 5 years post-surgery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Data of 93 patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery with age&gt;18 years, BMI&gt;40kg/m2, and/or had obesity related medical conditions were reviewed. Psychosocial variables were obtained from the Bariatric Surgery Screening Tool, Beck Depression Inventory II, Self-Report Family Inventory, and the Obesity Adjustment Survey (OAS). Factors analyzed included depression, obesity related quality of life (O-QoL), and family functioning. Descriptive statistics, paired-sample t-test and multiple regression were used. Successful bariatric surgery was defined as significant weight loss and few or no surgical complications.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Results indicated that a high proportion (66.7%) of this sample had a behavioral health condition.  Of note, 41.5% indicated some form of verbal/emotional abuse, and 20.7% indicate sexual abuse. On average, weight was about 76.09 pounds lower at six months, 94.75 lower at one year, and 84.53 at five years.  Weight and measures of depression and obesity-related quality of life significantly improved at 5 years post-surgery.  The regression model accounted for 13.9% of the variance; however, only one predictor variable (obesity-related quality of life) was found to be significant (p = 0.014). All other variables did not significantly contribute to predicting weight loss at five years after surgery. No psychosocial variable was predictive of complications. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Obese patients had a higher prevalence of behavioral health conditions such as depression when compared to the general population. However, this data did not reach statistical significance. Patients with a poor preoperative O-QoL were more likely to lose the maximum amount of weight after surgery. However, O-QoL, did not predict the risk of complications after bariatric surgery. While all psychosocial factors should be considered, this study indicates that preoperative assessment of the O-QoL is important in identifying and optimizing the bariatric surgery candidates and therefore maximizing the success of the procedure.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Luu<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Rush University Medical Center,General Surgery,Chicago, IL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  The utility of intraoperative cholangiography continues to be debated in the literature. Some surgeons perform routine cholangiography, while most use it selectively as an adjuvant tool in specific clinical situations. There is evidence to suggest that the use of cholangiography decreases the incidence of common bile duct injuries. It is also documented to cause increased operative times and cost, and, with the manipulation of the cystic duct during cholangiography, the procedure itself may actually lead to bile duct injury. Intraoperative cholangiography is also performed when there is a question of choledocholithiasis as it is diagnostic and can allow for therapeutic common bile duct exploration. Although with increasing availability of endoscopy, ERCP remains a pre and post operative option for management of choledocholithiasis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A single institution retrospective chart review was performed to identify patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy completed between 2007 and 2013.  Of those patients, the ones who underwent intraoperative cholangiogram were selected for further analysis. Specifically, hyperbilirubinemia, cholangiogram findings, attending surgeon, and need for common bile duct exploration were evaluated.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n=1590), 229 cholangiograms were performed (14.4%). Only 8.3% of the cholangiograms reported abnormal findings, which led to fifteen common bile duct explorations (6.6%). Two-thirds of these patients had elevated bilirubin, while the remaining one-third had normal liver enzymes. Twenty different attending surgeons performed intraoperative cholangiography over seven years. One attending performed 129 of these procedures (56%).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Intraoperative cholangiography continues to be used selectively and routinely depending on surgeon preference. When performed, the majority of cholangiograms do not show anatomic or pathologic abnormalities. And, even with the finding of choledocholithiasis on cholangiography, common bile duct exploration is, at times, deferred in favor of pursuing post operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Overall, from this chart review, there does not appear to be specific indications or benefit of pursuing intraoperative cholangiography.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Data from 483 patients with a diagnosis of C. difficile colitis was used in the study. 73.71% underwent total (n = 356) and 26.29% partial (n = 127) colectomies. Modified frailty index (mFI) is a previously described and validated 11-variable frailty measure used with NSQIP to assess frailty. Outcome measures included serious morbidity, overall morbidity, Clavien IV (requiring ICU), and Clavien V (mortality) complications. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Median age was 70 years, and BMI was 26.9Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. 44.4% of patients were males. 98.6% of patients were assigned ASA Class 3 or higher. The median mFI was 0.27 (0 &ndash; 0.63). As mFI increased from 0 (non-frail) to 0.36 and above, the overall morbidity and increased from 53.3% to 88.1% and serious morbidity increased from 43.3% to 76.1%, respectively. The Clavien IV complications rate increased from 30.0% to 73.9%. Mortality rate has increased from 6.7% to 46.3%. All results were statistically significant at p&lt;0.01.

Previous studies indicate a superiority of combination of dye and isotope for SLN biopsy in breast cancer patients to a single method of blue dye in terms of lower non-identification and false-negative rates. With increasing experience, however, surgeons had become comfortable to use the single method of dye. The use of blue dye alone remains an attractive option because of its technical simplicity and because it does not require any additional equipment or procedures. In this study, we re-evaluate the practice of performing sentinel lymph node biopsy with blue die alone.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 114 consecutive patients with breast cancer at the authors' institute between January 2014 and March 2015, when SLN biopsy was offered to all suitable patients with either a method with combined dye and isotope or dye alone. All procedures were done by experienced surgeons for SLN biopsy.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:During the study period, 66 patients underwent SLN biopsy with combined dye and isotope, and 48 patients underwent that with dye alone. The SLN was identified in all patients in each group. There was no difference between SLN biopsy with combined dye and isotope and that with dye alone in terms of operation time, time for SLN procedure, and number of SLN (median; n = 2). A positive rate for SLN metastasis was 19.6% (13/66) for patients underwent SLN biopsy with combined dye and isotope, and 12.5% (6/48) 48 patients underwent that with dye alone; there was no difference between the groups (P = 0.446).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our results indicate that SLN with dye alone is feasible for patients with breast cancer with comparable outcome to the combined method.

While there has been much published literature on pectus bar placement, there are a limited number of reports studying the corresponding bar removal procedure. Even less reported is the post-operative management following bar removal. Common practices have included obtaining a post-operative chest radiograph (CXR) despite the minimal risk of intra-thoracic complications associated with this procedure. The aim of this study is to review our experience with the bar removal procedure and with not obtaining routine CXRs following this operation. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A single institution retrospective chart review was performed from 2000 to 2012. Patients aged 8-35 who underwent a pectus bar removal procedure were included. We assessed operative timing of bar placement and removal, length of procedure and post-operative radiograph findings, specifically looking at rate of pneumothoraces.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:335 patients were identified in this study.  Of these, 80 percent were male. The mean age of bar placement was 14 years with a standard deviation of 3 years while the mean age of bar removal was 16 years with a standard deviation of 3.5 years. The average time between bar placement and bar removal was 33 months (range: 11-110 months). Most of our patients had one bar placed at initial procedure while 8 percent had two bars placed during repair. Operative times varied but on average bars were removed in 30 minutes (range: 10-96 min). Intra-operatively, 8 percent of patients had ossification of their bars although there was no noticeable effect of this finding on operative time.  Of our sample, 143 patients obtained a post-operative radiograph and of these 139 films revealed a pneumothorax. Only 1 patient obtained a chest tube for management of their post-operative pneumothorax. Only three patients were re-admitted and zero patients were hospitalized following their procedures.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Despite the detection of early post-operative pneumothoraces following bar removal, we have seldom found the need to clinically intervene on these findings. This suggests that not obtaining routine imaging following bar removal may be a safe practice.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Sleeve gastrectomy is one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures but the definition, incidence and cause of this problem is poorly reported and poorly understood.  We performed a systematic review to clarify these issues in patients following sleeve gastrectomy. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A systematic review was performed using four electronic databases to locate articles reporting the definition, rate or cause of weight regain in patients at least two years from sleeve gastrectomy.  Papers were excluded if the series was of non-primary sleeves, had follow-up outcomes of less than two years or were not reporting primary research. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:After abstract screening, 66 full text papers were reviewed of which thirteen met the inclusion criteria.  Five papers reported a definition, five papers reported a rate and nine papers proposed a cause for weight regain following sleeve gastrectomy. Definitions for weight regain reported in the literature included a gain of 10kg from nadir weight or an increase in BMI of 5kg/m2.  Rates of regain following sleeve gastrectomy ranged from 10.2% at two years to 75.6% at six years.  Proposed causes for the regain included initial sleeve size, sleeve dilation, increased ghrelin levels, inadequate follow-up support and maladaptive lifestyle behaviours. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Weight regain appears to be a common complication following sleeve gastrectomy that is variably defined, described and reported in the literature.  We make a number of recommendations to improve the reporting of clinical series so this problem can be better understood.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has been successfully employed in the management of adult blunt aortic trauma. However, its efficacy has not been elucidated in the pediatric population. The objective of this study was to gauge the burden of traumatic aortic injuries using a nationally representative sample and compare outcomes associated with reparative modalities in a nationally representative population of adolescent patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Four years (2000/2003/2006/2009) of data from the Kids Inpatient Database were queried for adolescent (10-19y) patients with diagnoses of blunt traumatic injuries to the abdominal/thoracic aorta. Included patients were divided into those who underwent EVAR and open aortic repair (OAR). Differences in associated outcomes -- mortality, morbidity (acute kidney injury, stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, ischemic colitis, paraplegia), length of stay (LOS), and total hospital cost of care -- were compared using multivariable logistic/linear (family gamma; link log) regression. Propensity-score quintiles were used to account for differences in patient-level factors; models were further risk-adjusted to account for potential confounding associated with hospital region, teaching status, and children's-hospital status. They were weighted to provide national estimates and account for clustering of patients within hospitals.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 161 records were identified, weighted to represent 244 admissions nationwide. Average age on presentation was 17.0 (&plusmn;2.0y) with a male preponderance (75.6%). EVAR was attempted in 27.4% (n=52) of cases. Patients who underwent EVAR had higher median ISS compared to the OAR group (38 vs 33, p=0.002). Risk-adjusted odds of death among EVAR patients were significantly lower relative to patients managed using OAR (p=0.031). No differences were found for complications. Marginally significant differences were reported for both LOS and total cost of care (table). Relative to OAR patients, use of EVAR was associated with a risk-adjusted predicted mean difference of 2.6 additional days and a corresponding increase in cost of approximately $20,200.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Despite higher ISS among adolescent patients undergoing EVAR procedures, risk-adjusted odds of death were significantly lower relative to OAR. Combined with a lack of variation in morbidity, the results suggest that EVAR is comparatively safe may even convey a survival advantage among adolescent patients.

Previous research has demonstrated the safety of ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the elderly. These studies, however, did not distinguish between hospital and freestanding ASCs.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We used logistic regression, clustering by facility to evaluate if ambulatory setting (hospital ASC versus freestanding ASC) was an independent predictor of acute care (ED visits or inpatient admissions) within 1 and 7 days after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy among patients 65 years or older in South Carolina. Due to low number of events, we used a machine learning technique (supervised principal components regression) to adjust for all available patient characteristics (gender, race, insurance, median household income, and preoperative Charlson comorbidity index score). This technique is an alternative to using all variables when adjusting by generating one covariate from a combination of the original variables. This new covariate retains much of the original information as possible in a single covariate. A sensitivity analysis evaluating ASCs that performed at least 25 laparoscopic cholecystectomies annually among all adult patients was also performed in order to evaluate if these findings would persist after taking annual volume into account. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 6,299 elderly patients who underwent a same-day laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the ambulatory setting in South Carolina from 2006 to 2013. Of these, 5,819 (92.4%) patients underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at 58 hospital ASCs compared to 480 (7.6%) patients who underwent this operation at 16 freestanding ASCs. Elderly patients who had laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed at a freestanding ASC had a higher odds of being admitted to the hospital within 1 day when compared to hospital ASCs (Adjusted Odds Ratio (OR)=10.4, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 3.9&ndash;27.5) but not within 7 days (OR=1.9, 95% CI 0.8&ndash;4.2). There was no significant difference between hospital ASCs and freestanding ASCs when evaluating subsequent ED visits (within 1 or 7 days). The sensitivity analysis confirmed these results.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Elderly patients who had same-day laparoscopic cholecystectomy at freestanding ASCs in South Carolina were more likely to be subsequently admitted to the hospital within 1 day when compared to hospital ASCs. As more surgical procedures are performed in the ambulatory setting, preoperative screening is critical to identify the safest and most efficient ambulatory surgery setting. Further research is needed on how to minimize acute care need following laparoscopic cholecystectomy at freestanding ASCs among the elderly.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Stepwise logistic models were built to determine the associations between MSH and 30-day, 90-day, and repeated readmissions, adjusting for patient, procedure, and hospital factors gradually.  MSH were defined as hospitals with highest proportion (top decile) of Black and Hispanic patients.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Among all patients, 88.5% underwent colon resections, 85.8% had open procedures, and 17.7% ostomies.

This study is designed to evaluate impact of hospital type on differences in short-term and oncologic outcomes between minimally invasive segmental colectomy (MIS) and open surgery.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Adult patients undergoing segmental colectomy for non-metastatic colon adenocarcinoma were identified from the 2010-2012 National Cancer Data Base. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize patterns of MIS (laparoscopic or robotic) vs. open colectomy by hospital type. Multivariable models were used to examine the effect of hospital type on short-term and oncologic outcomes from MIS vs. open surgery while adjusting for patient, clinical, and tumor characteristics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 97,620 patients underwent segmental colectomy for cancer: 44,027 (45%) underwent MIS, and 53.593 (55%) underwent open surgery. Overall, 25% of cases were performed at academic, 60% comprehensive community, and 15% community centers. MIS was more often utilized at comprehensive community (61%) and academic centers (27%) than community centers (12%). Compared to open surgery, the MIS group was more likely to have a complete tumor resection, shorter length of stay, lower 30-day mortality, and better overall survival regardless of institution type (all p &lt; 0.01). Length of stay was significantly shorter by 1 day in the MIS vs. open group across all hospital types (all p&lt;0.01), without increased 30-day readmissions. MIS was significantly associated with lower 30-day mortality, which was similar across hospital types: academic [OR 0.51 (CI 0.41-0.64), p&lt;0.01], comprehensive community [OR 0.56 (CI 0.49-0.63), p&lt;0.01], and community [OR 0.45 (CI 0.34-0.61), p&lt;0.01]. Overall survival benefit was also comparable throughout hospital types: academic [hazard ratio (HR) 0.71 (CI 0.69-0.76, p&lt;0.01], comprehensive community [HR 0.73 (CI 0.69-0.78), p&lt;0.01], and community [HR 0.72 (CI 0.63-0.810, p&lt;0.01].<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Minimally invasive segmental colectomy is associated with superior perioperative outcomes and lower 30-day mortality.

As a state of increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes, frailty is commonly associated with decreased reserves in multiple organ systems, such as declining cognition, physical ability, and health. We hypothesized that frailty, as assessed based on data derived from a large clinical database, would be associated with morbidity and mortality following paraesophageal hernia repair (PEH). <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried for ICD-9 and CPT codes associated with PEH repair.  The NSQIP participant use files for the years 2011-2013 were utilized.  Only subjects &ge; 60 years old were included. A previously described modified frailty index (mFI), based on 11 clinical variables available in the NSQIP dataset and derived from the model of cumulative deficits, was used to quantify frailty. Outcomes were 30-day mortality and the occurrence of post-operative 30-day complications. The Clavien-Dindo Classification system was used to characterize complication severity. Secondary outcomes were discharge destination and readmission. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between frailty, complications, and mortality.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 4434 PEH repairs performed in patients &ge; 60 years old in the study interval, 885 records were included in the final analysis (20%). Excluded patients were missing 1 or more variables in the 11-point mFI.  The overall rate of complications that were Clavien-Dindo Grade &ge; 3 (Grade 3 = requiring endoscopic, radiographic, or surgical intervention) were 6.1%.  Mortality was 0.9% (30-day).  The overall readmission rate was 8.2% (30-day) and 10.9% of patients were discharged to a facility other than home.  Relative to mFI scores of 0, 1, 2, and &ge;3, the respective percentages for the four outcomes were as follows; Clavien-Dindo Grade &ge;3 complication: 3.2%, 4.7%, 9.8%, and 23.3% (p &lt;0.0001); mortality: 0.0%, 0.9%, 1.8%, and 2.3% (p 0.0974); discharge to facility other than home: 4.4%, 10.9%, 15.7%, and 31.7% (p &lt;0.0001); and readmission: 8.9%, 6.8%, 8.5%, and 16.3% (p 0.1703).  Grade &ge;3 complications and discharge to a facility other than home were significantly correlated with mFI.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Frailty, as assessed by the mFI, is correlated with postoperative complications and discharge to a facility other than home following paraesophageal hernia repair.  Due to many missing variables needed to calculate an 11-item mFI in the NSQIP dataset, significant portions of otherwise eligible patients were excluded from this analysis.  The mFI may not be the ideal measure to assess frailty using the NSQIP dataset for this reason.  Future investigation is needed to better quantify frailty based on the clinical variables contained in the NSQIP dataset.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

The purpose of this study is to better understand the prevalence, risk factors, complications, and cost of symptomatic MU in RYGBP patients in patients followed &gt;2.5 years. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  With IRB approval, all patients having RYGBP at our institution from 2003-2012 were reviewed. All patients who developed symptomatic marginal ulcers were analyzed (MU group=166). A randomly selected cohort of RYGBP patients without MU were selected and analyzed for comparison (non MU group=150) Charts were retrospectively reviewed for ulcer risk factors, ulcer complications, and charges (hospital and physician). Here, postoperative upper endoscopy (EGD) was used as a surrogate for utilization of healthcare resources. All statistical analysis including multivariate regression was performed Stata/IC 14.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over a 10 year span, there were 2,019 patients who underwent RYGBP. 166 developed MU (8% incidence of MU). Of those 166 patients, 135 (81%) were conservatively managed with medication and 31 (19%) needed ulcer operation. Of these 31 patients, 19 had emergent operations due to perforation and 12 had elective operations. Men were more likely to need emergency operation (p&lt;0.05). On multivariate analysis, smoking and diabetes significantly increased the risk of MU (p&lt;0.05), but hypertension, GERD, male gender, increased age, or increasing BMI did not.  MU patients had a total of 437 EGDs after RYGBP, significantly more than patients without marginal ulcers who had a total of 41 (p&lt;.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Symptomatic MU is common after RYGBP and leads to increased utilization of healthcare resources. Though smoking cessation is already recommended, increased MU incidence in smokers highlights the importance of adherence in RYGBP patients. To our knowledge, the relationship between MU and diabetes has not been looked at. Long term acid suppression after RYGBP should be considered, especially in men, diabetics, and in patients with smoking history.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

As a result, patients are living longer and presenting with common surgical conditions such as acute appendicitis. Previous studies have examined single institution experiences, which have shown an increase in complications. We sought to investigate the effect of HIV and AIDS on postoperative outcomes in patients who undergo appendectomy. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We selected patients from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2005 and 2012 who underwent either laparoscopic or open appendectomy for acute appendicitis. We excluded cases of interval appendectomy. We used ICD-9 codes to identify patients with HIV and AIDS, and to identify complications. Data on patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), total hospital charges, and mortality during admission were also extracted. Using multivariate logistic regression, we created statistical models that controlled for age, gender, race, insurance type, socioeconomic status, number of Elixhauser comorbidities, and presence of perforation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 821 patients with HIV, 422 patients with AIDS and 338,425 patients served as controls. On univariate analysis comparing patients with HIV to controls, mean LOS was higher (3.8 days vs 3.0 days, p&lt;0.001) and mean total charge was higher ($33,350 vs $30,714, p&lt;0.0001). Comparing patients with AIDS to controls, those with AIDS had higher mean LOS (5.0 days vs 3.0 days, p&lt;0.001), higher mean total charge ($44,486 vs $30,704, p&lt;0.0001), more mechanical complications (2.4% vs 0.6%, p&lt;0.0001), and more postoperative complications (6.6% vs 3.1%, p&lt;0.0001).  Multivariate analysis showed that HIV status was not an independent risk factor for mortality or intraoperative and postoperative complications, but was associated with increased LOS (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.08-1.17, p&lt;0.0001). AIDS was an independent risk factor for postoperative infections (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.37-3.21, p=0.0007), digestive complications (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.01-2.43, p=0.046), increased LOS (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.18-1.30, p&lt;0.0001), and increased total charge (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.26, p&lt;0.0001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this large, retrospective analysis, we found that in patients with acute appendicitis who undergo appendectomy, HIV and AIDS were not observed to be independent risk factors for mortality.

Feeding gastrostomies are often used to improve the nutritional status of such patients.   Many also have evidence of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER), which raises the question of the need for a fundoplication at the time of the gastrostomy insertion.  When a gastrostomy is indicated, we generally use the open Stamm method to avoid abdominal CO<sup>2</sup> insufflation that may affect venous return to the heart and cause hypercapnia and, because GER tends to resolve in infants and young children, we rarely perform a fundoplication at the time of gastrostomy preferring to use gastro-jejunal (GJ) feeding instead for patients with clinically significant GER.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the subsequent course of a cohort of infants and children with CHD following open Stamm gastrostomy without fundoplication.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We reviewed our experience with all CHD patients who underwent feeding gastrostomy placement from January 1, 2004 to April 7, 2015. We examined demographic data, cardiac diagnoses, operative details, post-operative complications, and the need for GJ feeding or fundoplication.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: An open Stamm gastrostomy was performed in 111 patients.  Five additional patients had a fundoplication at the time of gastrostomy placement.  Median age at surgery was 37 weeks (range 3 weeks to 13.7 years); average weight was 5.3 &plusmn;4.9 kg.  Forty-eight patients (43%) had single ventricle physiology, 50 (45%) had biventricular physiology, and 13 (12%) had cardiomyopathy.  Thirty-four (30%) patients experienced a total of 37 minor complications, which included tube dislodgement after maturation of the stoma (20), superficial surgical site infection (13), mechanical failure (3), and bleeding (1).  Three (3%) patients experienced a major complication defined as a need for return to the OR or peri-operative death (&lt;30 days). Only three (3%) patients required a subsequent fundoplication.  At last follow-up (median 7.2 months, range 2 days-6 years), 56 of the 90 (62%) surviving patients continue to receive gastrostomy feeds, of those 7 (13%) patients continue to require GJ feeds.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Children with CHD tolerate an open Stamm gastrostomy well with minimal major complications.  GER in CHD patients frequently resolves over time and patients seldom require a subsequent fundoplication. Our experience supports very selective use of fundoplication in infants and children with CHD who require a feeding gastrostomy.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

We will examine the variation in demographic and socioeconomic factors using a population database. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Secondary analysis of the 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was performed. Hospital discharges were identified using ICD-9 and ICD-9-CM codes for liver metastases, colon and rectal cancer and colon and rectal resections.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 3758 admissions for colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver in 2011.  The mean age was 62 years (22-102) and the majority of patients were male (56.5%). Patients with stage IV colorectal cancer were 62.7% white, 15.5% black, 10.2% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian/Pacific Islander and 2.2% other.  During these admissions, mean length of stay was 5.8 days (0-50).  31.5% (1182) of these admissions were for patients with a primary diagnosis of liver metastasis and a secondary diagnosis of rectal cancer.  Patients with stage IV rectal cancer were younger than those with colon (mean age 58.9 vs. 63.6, p=0.000) and seemed more likely to be male, but the difference was not significant (58.2% vs. 55.9% male, p=0.182).

Surgical treatments for HS include incision and drainage or surgical excision with or without closure.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We reviewed 214 patients (with 293 surgical procedures) with axillary HS who underwent surgical intervention.  We divided the cohort into two groups based on recurrence, and then compared them. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The mean age of onset of HS was 32.5 years.  Females comprised 84.1% of the cohort.  Average BMI was 33.37.  55% of patients smoked.  19.2% of patients had diabetes. 1.9% of patients had a positive MRSA history.  35.5% of patients had bilateral axillary disease, and 9.3% had extra-axillary disease.  The vast majority (93.5%) of interventions included excision of the diseased area, with a median area of excision of 78cm<sup>2</sup>.  45.4% of these wounds were closed, 48.8% were allowed to heal by secondary intention, and 4.8% were treated with a vacuum device.  22/214 (10.3%) of patients had recurrent disease.  Closure vs. non-closure was not associated with a proclivity towards recurrence.  Recurrence after surgical treatment was significantly associated with extra-axillary disease (p=0.039).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Patients with HS were overwhelmingly obese and female, and many of them smoked.  Surgical excision was the most common intervention, and closure was employed in roughly half of patients.  Recurrence after excision, albeit uncommon, was associated with extra-axillary disease, but not closure after excision.  These characteristics may be helpful in counseling patients about risk of recurrence and overall prognosis.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

When injured, patients frequently use online searches to find out the initial treatment for their condition. In this study, 40 websites for burn treatment on two major search engines were identified. The content was analyzed on the accessibility, usability, reliability, and accuracy of the information.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The phrases 'burn treatment', 'burn first aid', 'burn care', and 'how to treat a burn' were searched on Google and Bing on 2/11/2015 and 4/29/2015, and the top 10 results of each search was recorded. Out of the 40 articles recorded, there are  a total of 24 unique articles for Google and 19 for Bing that were analyzed using the LIDA Instrument v.1.2 (Minervation, Ltd.). This instrument uses a series of questions to score the accessibility, usability, and reliability of health websites and then produces an overall rating for that website. Accessibility is defined as whether people can access your website, usability is how easy it is for users to find out the information they want to know, and reliability is whether the website keeps up to date with the best current knowledge. This instrument defines a good website as one that scores a 90% or higher, a moderate website has a score of 50-89%, and a bad website has a score below 50%. To analyze the accuracy of the websites a checklist was created using ABA referral criteria and expert opinion by a trained burn surgeon on treating burns.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the total 24 unique burn treatment websites identified in Google searches, four were from an ABA verified burn center or the ABA itself, the rest of the websites were from medical personnel or made by non medical consumer reports. The average accessibility score was 86% (63-98%), usability was 75% (42-92%), reliability was 64% (20-87%), and the average total score was 78% (62-91%). The average accuracy score for these websites was 55% (3-97%) , and only one of the websites was considered good.The Bing search engine provided 19 different burn treatment websites. Only one was from an ABA verified burn center. The average accessibility score was 86% (59-98%), usability was 71% (42-92%), reliability was 62% (7-87%), and the average total score was 76% (41-91%).Between both search engines there was an overlap of 12 websites.

We developed a dual-stage (DSVHR) approach for MHGS Grade 3 patients to decrease the SSI and recurrence rates. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Retrospective review of adult general surgery patients undergoing DSVHR between January 2010 and June 2014. All patients were MHGS Grade 3. Primary endpoint was 30-day superficial and deep SSI. Secondary endpoints included other surgical site occurrences (SSO), 6-month recurrence, and mesh excision rates.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Fifteen patients underwent DSVHR. Mean age was 56 years and median BMI of 38.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Operative indication included ECF (n=6), ECF with infected mesh (n=2), infected mesh (n=2), and ventral hernia repair requiring bowel resection (n=5). Thirty-one operative procedures were performed with median of 2.5 days between procedures. Midline was re-established in 12 patients; five patients had underlay biologic mesh placement; seven underwent component separation with retrorectus mesh placement [synthetic (n=2), biologic (n=5)].

The mesh has been shown, in a porcine model, to maintain support of a hernia repair site over a 52 week period.  Little literature is available regarding outcomes using Phasix mesh for hernia repair.  Early data available includes multi-center data outlining outcomes in a population consisting of a majority of primary hernia repairs. A study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of Phasix in a patient population consisting primarily of complex and recurrent hernias.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A single-institutional study was undertaken at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, PA to review outcomes of 52 patients between September 2014 and July 2015 in a population consisting primarily of complicated and recurrent hernias. Patient data extracted included demographic information, BMI, past medical history, past surgical history, mesh dimensions, operative and hospital course data, complications, and follow-up, including readmission.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Fifty-two patients were identified upon review of our records (27 males, 25 females), all of which received overlay Phasix mesh for hernia repair after primary fascial closure. Thirty-four of the patients were over the age of 50 (65.4%), with an average age of 56.7 years. The average BMI of the population was 32.1, with 5 patients &lt; 25 kg/m2 (9.6%), 16 patients 25 - 29.9 kg/m2 (30.7%), 15 patients 30 - 34.9 kg/m2 (28.8%) and 16 patients &gt; 35 kg/m2 (30.7%). Forty-seven of the patients had ventral hernias (90.4%), 43 were incisional (82.7%), 5 were umbilical (9.6%), and 2 were inguinal (3.8%). Thirty-one of the patients were being treated for recurrent hernias (59.6%). The average surgery lasted 4.46 hours, and the average stay was 3.9 days, with 8 patients requiring readmission (15.4%).

Chen<sup>1</sup>, J. Yoo<sup>1</sup>, M. Kiely<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Tufts Medical Center,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Endoscopic removal of benign colon polyps is not always possible, even with advanced endoscopic techniques.  While segmental colectomy has been the traditional therapy for these polyps, this procedure is associated with an increased risk of complications and may be unnecessary given that fewer than 20% of these polyps harbor malignancy.  Combined endoscopic laparoscopic surgery (CELS) has emerged as an alternative method to address these polyps. Here, endoscopic removal of complex polyps is facilitated by laparoscopic manipulation of the bowel wall, thereby avoiding a bowel resection and its associated risks. While feasibility, safety, and improved short term patient outcomes have been demonstrated, there has never been an evaluation of cost comparing these two approaches within a single institution.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: In this observational cohort study, we examined five patients who underwent CELS for right colon polyps at a large tertiary care center (Tufts Medical Center, TMC) between April 2014 and July 2015.  We compared the cost of CELS to that of ten patients who underwent a traditional laparoscopic right colectomy performed for a colon polyp or cancer during the study period.  The cost analysis covered the perioperative period from operating room to hospital discharge. Microcosting estimates were obtained from the literature and applied to our specific operating room time and length of stay data for our cohorts. A modified societal perspective was used as the costing structure, with all cost estimates obtained for university hospital settings. The costing estimates were adjusted using the medical consumer price index to 2014 US dollars.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of five patients were taken to the operating room with the intention of performing CELS for right colon polyps. Four out of the five patients successfully underwent CELS surgery. The median length of stay (LOS) for all successful CELS patients was 1 day.  LOS for patients who underwent a laparoscopic right colectomy at TMC over the same time period was 4.5 days. The median OR time for successful CELS was 157.5 minutes, compared to 141.5 minutes for a laparoscopic right colectomy. The calculated total cost for a CELS patient was $7,513.10, compared to $14,600.50 for a laparoscopic right colectomy, a 49% cost-savings almost entirely attributable to a difference in length of stay.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In the perioperative period, successful CELS procedures are performed at a lower cost compared to traditional laparoscopic colectomy, with the most significant cost saver being shorter hospital length of stay. This is the first study to directly compare the cost of successful CELS to traditional laparoscopic colectomy in the surgical management of benign colon polyps within a single institution.  Future studies will evaluate both short and long term costs using intention to treat analysis and a larger sample size.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

While historically considered to be high-risk and complex procedures, morbidity and mortality from pancreatic resections have decreased dramatically. We carried out this study to determine independent predictors of mortality following pancreatic resection in a single tertiary healthcare institution.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Clinical data was collected retrospectively from the records of 111 patients who underwent pancreatic resections from 2004-2013. Mortality was ascertained by the use of hospital records, and the publicly accessible social security death master file (SS-DMF). A univariate screen of possible factors associated with mortality was performed using the Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables; a multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed to determine the independent effects of each factor. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the chosen model.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Mortality at 1, 3, and 5 years was 13.2%, 38.4%, and 45.9% respectively. Multivariate logistic regression found that a history of diabetes mellitus (OR = 6.48, p&lt;0.0026), adenocarcinoma (OR = 8.17, p&lt;0.0003), disease recurrence (loco-regional or distant) after initial resection (OR = 4.25, p&lt;0.0235), and post-operative hypotension requiring vasopressors or inotropes within 30 days of surgery (OR = 12.76, p&lt;0.0138) were associated with mortality (AUC=0.86).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Mortality in patients after pancreatic resection is associated with the primary diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, disease recurrence after primary resection, and a history of DM. The only independent predictor not associated with primary pancreatic disease and comorbidity is hypotension requiring vasopressors or inotropes within 30 days after resection. The risk of mortality after pancreatic resection can be decreased by active measures to prevent the occurrence of post-operative hypotension and by rapid treatment when it does occur.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

Several techniques have been utilized to decrease SSI rates in midline laparotomy incisions, however no technique has shown superiority. Evidence suggests incisional negative pressure wound therapy (INPWT) can decrease wound complications but no literature exists regarding INPWT for high-risk laparotomy incisions. We sought to analyze the efficacy of INPWT in the management of high-risk midline laparotomy incisions.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Retrospective review of adult patients who underwent laparotomy between January 2013 and June 2014 with midline closure utilizing INPWT. Only class III or IV wounds were included. Laparotomy incisions were loosely closed. INPWT set at 125mmHg is placed over oil emulsion impregnated gauze. INPWT is removed after 5 days and the wound left open to air. Records were reviewed for immediate and/or delayed surgical site complications. Primary endpoint was 30-day incisional SSI. Secondary endpoints included other surgical site complications.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: One class III and 12 class IV wounds with median of five days INPWT. The class III wound had a small skin dehiscence with no evidence of superficial or deep SSI. Three of 12 patients with a class IV wound developed a superficial SSI.

Angiogenesis is one of the known hallmarks of cancer that is essential for cancer progression and aggressiveness. The angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) ligand and its Tie receptors constitute one of the upstream cascades that control the angiogenic switch. However, its impact on cancer progression and prognosis has been a topic of debate, since its effect has been 'context dependent', i.e. results change depending on the experimental setting used. Using The Cancer Genome Altas (TCGA), we investigate associations between breast cancer patient survival and genomic expressions of genes involved in the Ang2-Tie pathway. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The gene expressions of Ang2, Tie1 and Tie2 in the Ang2-Tie pathway and of VEGFA and VEGF receptors in the VEGF pathway were analyzed using the RNA-seq data for 886 individual patient tumor transcriptomes from TCGA. The mean age of the cohort was 58.5 &plusmn; 13.2 years. We identified gene-specific expression thresholds to dichotomize patients into high and low expression for a survival analysis using in-house R scripts and R's 'survival' package. Associations with overall and disease free survival were investigated for each gene individually and for the combined effect of multiple genes. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Individual analysis of the genes revealed decreased disease free survival among tumors with high pro-angiogenesis factor Ang2 expression (p=0.04) and decreased overall survival with high Ang2 expression (p=0.03).  High co-expression of Ang2 and endothelial cell surface receptors Tie1 and Tie2 were associated with poor overall survival. In the multi-gene analysis, disease free survival was significantly decreased among patients with high co-expression of Ang2 and VEGFA, and Tie1 and VEGF receptors 1-3. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Ang2 binds to Tie2 to stimulate endothelial cell sprouting and angiogenesis, and high Ang2 expression is correlated with increased tumor vascularity in animal models. Ang2 also stimulates the well-studied downstream vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways. Our results, from a large prospectively collected national breast cancer genome database, provide clinical evidence of the deleterious effect of Ang2 and Tie receptor overexpression in breast cancer patient survival through the Ang2-Tie and VEGF pathways. Novel therapies targeting this pathway are therefore expected to improve survival.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

This test therefore has the potential to help avoid unnecessary surgery on Bethesda III and IV nodules that are ultimately found to be benign. Our study aimed to assess the clinical utility of the AGEC molecular assay for thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytopathology at a tertiary referral center. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Retrospective analysis of all indeterminate thyroid nodules evaluated with GEC from September 2012 to December 2014 at a large tertiary referral center was performed. Cytologic and AGEC diagnosis were compared with final surgical pathology in corresponding samples. A prevalence of malignancy of 40%, as established at our institution, was used to estimate performance characteristics with Bayes Theorem.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over the course of 27 months, 154 patients with indeterminate nodules by FNA who underwent AGEC testing were identified. Of these, AGEC classified 104 (67.5%) as suspicious, 43 (27.9%) as benign, and 7 (4.6%) as non-diagnostic. Of the 104 suspicious AGEC patients, 71 underwent thyroidectomy (2 patients were operated on elsewhere), and ---------43/69 (62.3%) had malignant final pathology. Of the 43 benign AGEC patients, 8 underwent thyroidectomy and 1/8 (12.5%) had malignant final pathology. Based on these data, our AGEC sensitivity is 97.7% and specificity is 21.1%.  Given the 40% prevalence of malignancy at our institution, the estimated negative predictive value of AGEC in our practice is 93.3%. Our mean follow-up time for this study was 7.8 months.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study confirms that patients with suspicious AGEC have a high likelihood of having a malignancy and should undergo surgery. Our study suggests that practice-specific cancer incidence within the indeterminate cytopathology (Bethesda III-IV) group should be calculated at each institution to evaluate its unique NPV of Afirma analysis. Thus, the clinical utility of a benign AGEC result in surgical decision-making varies with disease prevalence, which is unique to each practice.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

However, the impact of a prolonged SI where residual melanoma (RM) may be present in the final specimen is less clear. This study was undertaken to assess whether SI as it relates to the presence of RM in the final specimen affects prognosis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of our institutional melanoma database from 2009 and 2011 was performed. Fisher exact tests and Kruskal Wallis tests were used to compare characteristics by RM status. Survival was estimated with Kaplan Meier methods and compared with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for covariates.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 240 patients in the database, 179 treated for non-metastatic cutaneous melanoma were included. The median age was 61 years and 51% were male (n=92). At initial bx, 60% (n=108) had a shave bx, 14% (n=25) had a punch bx, and 26% (n=46) had an excisional bx. All patients underwent a radical excision of the primary lesion and 74% (n=132) underwent a sentinel lymph node bx. The median SI was 41 days (range 8-1280) and it did not differ by biopsy type (p=0.36). On final pathology, 45% (n=81) had RM present. RM was more likely to be found in punch bx (n=19 of 25) compared to shave bx (46 of 108) and excisional bx (16 of 46) (76% vs. 43% vs. 35%, p=0.003). The presence of RM did not differ by Breslow depth (p=0.32). Median follow-up was 12.4 months (range 0.2-35.7), during which 13 patients had disease recurrence or died. Recurrence free survival (RFS) was significantly lower in patients with a longer SI (split at median &le; 41 days for shorter SI vs. &gt; 41 days for longer SI) (p=0.035). RFS at 12 months was 97.3% (CI 89.6-99.3) for a shorter SI and 89.7% (CI 78.1-98.3) for a longer SI; at 24 months, the RFS was 94.4% (CI 82.3-98.3) and 83.5% (CI 68.6-91.8), respectively. Differences in overall survival (OS) were borderline significant (p=0.069) with OS at 12 months was 98.7% (CI 91.2-99.8) for shorter SI and 94.7% (CI 84.3-98.3) for longer SI; at 24 months, the OS was 95.6% (CI 81.8-99.0) and 82.2% (CI 64.1-91.7), respectively. RFS and OS did not differ by RM status (p=0.20 and p=0.19, respectively).  However, for SI and RM status in combination, patients who had RM and a longer SI had the lowest RFS with a 12 month RFS of 81.0% (CI.55.9-92.7) compared to 92.9% (CI 84.3-96.9) for the other groups combined (p=0.022). In multivariable analysis, with adjustment for stage, age, and Breslow depth, patients who had RM and a longer SI had borderline significance for RFS (p=0.074, hazard ratio = 2.99, 95% CI=0.90-9.98).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Longer SI, especially in combination with the presence of RM following initial bx, is associated with worse RFS. Patients anticipated to have RM should be triaged appropriately to avoid delays to definitive excision.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

While higher rates of mortality are commonly ascribed to high-risk resections, the impact of more common operations is unclear. We sought to evaluate causes of mortality following colon cancer operations across hospitals.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  : 49 American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (ACS-CoC) hospitals were selected for participation in a CoC special study. We ranked hospitals using a composite measure of mortality and performed onsite chart reviews. We examined patient characteristics and mortality following colon resections at very high mortality (HMH) and very low mortality (LMH) hospitals (2006-2007).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 3,025 patients who underwent surgery at 25 LMHs (n = 1,391) and 24 HMHs (n = 1,634). There were wide differences in mortality between HMHs and LMHs (9.2% vs. 2.7%). Compared to LMHs, HMHs had more patients who were black (11.2% vs. 6.5%), had &gt;2 comorbidities (22.7% vs. 18.9%), ASA class 4-5 (11.9% vs. 5.3%), and were functionally dependent (13.9% vs. 8.9%; p&lt;.001 for all). For emergency resections, mortality was higher in HMHs versus LMHs (28.3% vs. 11.4%; OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.7) with ICU admission and prolonged mechanical ventilation more likely in HMHs.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is significant variation in mortality across hospitals for colon cancer surgery. In emergent cases, perioperative mortality is nearly as high as 1 in 3 patients in HMHs, and many who die undergo ICU admission with mechanical ventilation.

Additionally, more advanced technologies to quantify myopenia, including complex volumetric analysis and densitometric algorithms, are not always available in the clinical setting. We sought to reliably quantify prognostic indicators of preoperative cachexia as a predictor of clinical outcomes with routine imaging applicable to any office or hospital site.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Preoperative CT scans were electronically available and suitable for analysis in 73 of 82 consecutive patients with PC undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) between November, 2010 and February, 2014. The psoas index was computed from cross-sectional areas of psoas muscles normalized to vertebral body area at L3. Correlation and proportional hazards analyses were performed to identify relationships between muscularity, preoperative nutritional markers, clincopathologic parameters and long-term survival.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Psoas index correlated strongly with preoperative hemoglobin and albumin levels (P = .001 and .014, respectively), identifying a pattern of preoperative frailty. High psoas index, albumin and hemoglobin levels significantly correlated with improved long-term survival (HR 0.014, P &lt; .001; HR 0.43, P &lt; .001 and HR = 0.80, P = .014). However, on multivariate analysis, psoas index proved to be the only independent predictor of survival (HR 0.021; P = .003). Notably, rapid declines in psoas index during neoadjuvant chemotherapy were associated with poor postoperative outcomes, as were declines in psoas index during the postoperative period. <br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: The data indicate that the psoas index, a measurement available in any clinical setting, is a statistically powerful predictor of survival in PC, when compared to tumor grade and stage as well as previously validated nutritional parameters.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Gastric cancers are mostly asymptomatic and the presence of symptoms generally signals more advanced disease. Studies suggest that emergent cancer surgery for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are associated with later cancer stages and worse outcomes. Our objective was to compare outcomes of patients who underwent non-elective gastric cancer surgery following an admission through the emergency department (ED) with patients receiving elective surgery or surgery after planned admission using a US representative database.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to examine adults admitted with gastric cancer who underwent gastric cancer surgery over five years (2007-2011). NIS is an all-payer database designed to yield national estimates of hospital inpatient stays. Demographics and outcomes were compared between those who had their surgery performed non-electively after an ED admission with those who did not. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine predictors of being discharged to home.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  9,279 patients who underwent gastric cancer surgery were included for analysis. 1,143 (12%) underwent non-elective surgery following an ED admission. These patients were more likely to be female (42% vs. 35%), non-white (61% vs. 43%), elderly &ge;75 years (40% vs. 26%), admitted to an urban non-teaching hospital (46% vs. 25%), in the lowest quartile for median household income (31% vs. 25%), and have one or more comorbidities (87% vs. 70%). They were less likely to have private insurance (19% vs. 37%). They had a longer median length of stay (16 vs. 9 days), number of days to surgery (5 vs. 0), were more likely to die during their hospitalization (8% vs. 3%) and less likely to be discharged home (63% vs. 82%). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, we found that having non-elective surgery following an ED admission was independently associated with a lower likelihood of being discharged to home [OR: 0.49 (95% CI: 0.42 - 0.57)]. On sensitivity analysis, our findings remained unchanged regardless of whether specific complications were included in the model.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Nationally, 12% of all gastric cancer surgeries are done following an admission through the ED. This tends to occur more frequently in vulnerable populations. Our finding that patients undergoing non-elective surgery following an ED admission had worse outcomes than those of patients getting surgery electively has implications towards the design of future studies to help improve outcomes for these patients. Outcomes after gastric cancer surgery may be improved by a) developing programs to detect gastric cancer in patients prior to the development of symptoms prompting presentation to the ED, b) improving access to health care in vulnerable populations, and c) encouraging elective scheduling of surgery for stable gastric cancer patients.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Furthermore, considering that ATC increases in frequency with age, no investigations of large data sets exist that have examined the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population. Therefore, we utilized the National Cancer Data Base to determine the importance of age as a prognostic factor in anaplastic thyroid cancer.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: All AYA patients (&le;39 yo) with diagnosis of ATC were reviewed from the National Cancer Data Base from 1998 to 2012. They were then compared to older patient groups [40-65 yo (middle age) and &ge; 66 yo (elderly)] with same diagnosis. Log-rank test was used to compare survival functions between age groups and chi-squared tests were used to compare tumor size, method of diagnosis, time from diagnosis to definitive treatment, presence of comorbidities (based on Charlson/Deyo Score), and type of surgery performed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and their associated p-values. A secondary analysis was performed to evaluate whether surgical intervention was associated with survival in AYA patients.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Out of total of 3,154 patients with ATC, 39 patients fit the criteria of AYA. Median survival in the AYA group was 118.5 months compared to 61.1 months (p=0.06) in middle and 66.2 months (p=0.06) in elderly groups. Compared to the AYA group, the HR for middle age and elderly groups were 1.96 (p=0.02) and 1.73 (p=0.06), respectively. The age groups demonstrated similar tumor size (&gt;4cm in 84.6% vs. 85.7% vs. 83.8%) at time of diagnosis. AYA group had a significantly lower prevalence of comorbid conditions (12.5%) when compared to other age groups (21.2% and 27.6% respectively). AYA group had greater mean period between diagnosis and definitive treatment (19.4 &plusmn;3.6 days vs. 16.3 &plusmn;0.8 vs. 15.1 &plusmn;0.5 days) and a higher rate of FNA prior to intervention (97.3% vs. 92.0% vs. 87.8%).  Consequently, following adjustment for confounders (tumor size, comorbidities, method of diagnosis and surgery) mortality in the middle- and older-aged groups was approximately 50% higher compared to the AYA group [HR=1.52 (p=0.16) and HR=1.56 (p=0.14), respectively], though these differences were not statistically significant. Within the AYA group there was no significant difference in survival between surgery employed as initial treatment (followed by radiation and chemotherapy) and non-surgical (radiation and chemotherapy) intervention only.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:While anaplastic thyroid cancer is an aggressive tumor with overall poor prognosis, adolescents and young adults appeared to have increased survival compared to older populations.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term morbidity and mortality after combined resection of the liver and pancreas, as well as to determine whether or not these aggressive operations are associated with long-term survival. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Consecutive patients who underwent synchronous hepatectomy and pancreatectomy (SHP) at a single instution were retrospectively evaluated. Extent of liver resection was categorized into major hepatectomy (defined as lobectomy or trisectionectomy) and minor hepatectomy (less than 3 liver segments). Preoperative patient features, perioperative outcomes, and long-term survival following synchronous hepatectomy and pancreatectomy (SHP) were evaluated.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 2005 to 2014, 61 patients underwent SHP.  Diagnoses include 34 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET), 6 sarcomas, 3 cholangiocarcinomas, 3 adrenocortical carcinomas, 3 cystic pancreatic neoplasms, 2 renal cell carcinomas, 2 colon cancers, 2 recurrent gastric cancers, 2 gastrointestinal stromal tumors, 2 peritoneal mesotheliomas, 1 appendiceal cancer, and 1 ovarian cancer.  Patients were further categorized into 3 groups based on the extent of SHP (Table).  There were no differences in patient demographics, comorbidities, ASA status, estimated blood loss, need for blood transfusion, 30 or 90-day mortality.  Furthermore, the incidence of major complications was similar between the three groups, except for liver insufficiency (defined as peak postoperative bilirubin of 7 or more), which affected one-third of patients who underwent major hepatectomy with any pancreatectomy (p=0.004).  Length of stay correlated with extent of SHP (p=0.042).   Patients with PNET had more favorable prognosis compared to all other malignant histologies combined (5-year overall survival 47% vs. 26%; p=0.002). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Combined hepatectomy with pancreatectomy is a technically challenging operation. In carefully selected patients, combined hepatectomy and pancreatectomy can be associated with long-term survival.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

However, there were early reports of port-site metastasis (PSM) when incidental gallbladder adenocarcinoma (GBCA) was discovered in the specimen after surgery. In a review of cases up until 1999, the estimated incidence of PSM in incidental GBCA was reported to be 14%. Recognition of this phenomenon may have prompted changes in surgical technique, and we questioned whether the incidence of port-site metastasis has changed since then. Furthermore, direct contact between the specimen and wound edges during extraction is one of the possible mechanisms of PSM. Determining the incidence of both extraction and non-extraction port PSMs may provide insight into this hypothesis. Hypothesis: 1) The risk of PSM following resection of GBCA has decreased over the past fifteen years. 2) Extraction ports are more likely to harbour recurrence than non-extraction ports. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A systematic review of articles related to wound recurrence of GBCA was conducted by two independent reviewers. Inclusion criteria for our first objective of determining the modern incidence of PSM were English language papers reporting the presence or absence of PSM following a minimum of 5 cholecystectomies harbouring GBCA published from 2000 &ndash; 2014, the 15 year period following the previous review. Inclusion criteria for our second objective of determining the location of the port site involved include English language papers reporting the presence of PSM following laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the setting of GBCA, without limiting this search temporally or by study size.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:5448 abstracts were screened. 23 published case series met criteria for estimating the modern incidence of PSM in GBCA. PSM were found in 73 of 728 patients (incidence=10%). Results from the two largest studies using prospectively collected databases (n= 114 and n= 96) had PSM incidences of 14% and 15% respectively. With respect to the pattern of PSM, data was extracted from 98 papers meeting inclusion criteria. More than 305 individual port sites have been reported to harbour recurrence in 236 patients with GBCA (number of PSM/ person = 1-4). Of those with decipherable location (extraction vs non-extraction) (n=190) based on description within the paper, 53% occurred at extraction ports compared to 47% at non-extraction ports (p=0.526).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Despite the implementation of techniques for risk reduction, the incidence of PSM following gallbladder cancer resection is stable at 10-15%. Recurrence at non-extraction ports may indicate mechanism(s) other than direct contact with the wound during extraction. Studies into mechanisms of PSM are warranted. Preoperative imaging studies should be carefully reviewed to minimize inappropriate laparoscopic resection of gallbladder cancer.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Obesity evokes chronic inflammation, which stimulates cancer progression. Ceramide is a key metabolite in both anabolic and catabolic pathways of sphingolipids, and the very long fatty acyl chain (C24:0 and C22:0) ceramides are elevated both in the tissues and in the circulation of obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. One of the mechanisms of obesity-mediated inflammation is due to release of ceramide from adipocytes after lipolysis. It has been reported that the ceramides and other obesity-related factors trigger activation of inflammasome that result in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines  such as IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha under the obese condition. However, serum levels of ceramides in breast cancer patients associated with obesity have not been elucidated to date. In this study, we examine the levels of ceramides in breast cancer patients to reveal the association of the sphingolipids with obesity and breast cancer progression.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 59 patients with breast cancer, in whom the disease was diagnosed as stage I, II or III pathologically. The serum from the patients were obtained when the diagnosis was made and any treatment had been done before the blood collection.

The levels of ceramides were analyzed with clinicopathological data of the patients.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with the pathological stage (P &lt; 0.05). The levels of ceramides were detected successfully in the serum from 59 breast cancer patients. The levels of ceramide were not associated with clinical demographics of the patients including age, hormone receptors (ER, PgR) and HER2 status, Ki-67 index, nuclear grade, lymphatic and vascular invasion of the tumor. Interestingly, however, levels of C24:0 ceramide in patients with high BMI (&gt; 25) was significantly higher than that in patients with normal BMI (&lt; 22) (P &lt; 0.05). Further, levels of C24:0 ceramide were significantly elevated with pathological stage (P &lt; 0.05). C22:0 ceramide also showed trends of similar associations with BMI and pathological stage, albeit they were not statistically significant.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our results show an elevation of very long fatty acyl chain (C24:0 and C22:0) ceramides in serum of obesity-related breast cancer.

The purpose of the study was to determine predictors and causes of early and late post-operative mortality in patients undergoing pancreatectomy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A prospective pancreas surgery registry at a very-large volume hospital was queried to identify early (30-day) and late (90-day) postoperative mortality between 2008 and 2015. Logistic regression was undertaken to determine predictors of each. Causes of death were categorized as: hemorrhagic, cardiorespiratory, sepsis and disease progression. Sepsis was sub-categorized as related (presence of infected intra-abdominal collections, abscess, fistula, and surgical site infection) or unrelated to surgery (pneumonia, CLABSI, CAUTI). Disease progression signified withdrawal of care in an otherwise viable patient due to perceived poor prognosis as a result of documented recurrent or persistent disease.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 312 patients underwent resection (68% Whipple, 32% Distal Pancreatectomy). Early postoperative mortality occurred in 12 (3.8%) patients and late in 24 (7.7%) patients with a total postoperative mortality of 11.5%. Early deaths occurred during index admission in 83% while 95.5% of late deaths occurred outside of the hospital or in patients that were discharged and returned to hospital and died. (Table)On univariate analysis, age, smoking history, intensive care unit requirement (ICU), presence of complications, operative estimated blood loss, body mass index, discharge destination, presence of tachycardia, elevated WBC at discharge and type of insurance predicted any postoperative mortality. On multivariate analysis, only ICU (OR 20.3 p 0.0003) and discharge destination of home and SNF compared to rehabilitation facility remained significant (p&lt;0.05). Private insurance was a protective factor compared to Medicare, Medicaid and uninsured (p&lt;0.05).  Sepsis arising from surgical complications was the primary source of early postoperative mortality while disease progression was the most common cause of late mortality.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Surgical complications remain the primary source of early postoperative mortality, which are largely unavoidable. Late postoperative mortality may be mitigated by minimization and early detection of hospital-acquired infection through adherence to best care guidelines and neo-adjuvant strategies to identify patients with low risk of disease progression in which further treatment is non futile.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Gene expression classifier (GEC) testing was developed to further stratify patients with Bethesda III nodules as benign or suspicious for cancer. Given the known variability of GEC testing between institutions, this study evaluates the utility of this genetic testing in patients with Bethesda III nodules at a single institution.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of prospectively collected data of 663 consecutive patients with index thyroid nodules who underwent FNA and thyroidectomy was performed.  FNA results were based on the BSRTC system, and GEC testing was later utilized in Bethesda III patients as benign or suspicious for malignancy. Patients with Bethesda III nodules underwent initial thyroid lobectomy for definitive diagnosis unless there was a history of radiation exposure, familial thyroid cancer, obstructive symptoms, bilateral nodules and/or patient preference for which total thyroidectomy was performed. Bethesda III nodules were subdivided into malignant or benign groups based on final pathology. Among patients who underwent GEC testing, final pathology was compared to initial GEC results.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 663 patients who underwent FNA, 129 patients had Bethesda III nodules of which 66 (51.2%) had malignancy (Papillary thyroid cancer, n=54; Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), n=10; Medullary carcinoma, n=1; Lymphoma, n=1) on final pathology. Of the remaining Bethesda III patients, 63 (48.8%) had benign pathology (Adenomatoid nodule, n=18; H&uuml;rthle Cell adenoma, n=2; chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, n= 6; Follicular adenoma n= 10; Multinodular hyperplasia (MNH), n=26; Cyst, n=1). A total of 108 patients with Bethesda III nodules without GEC testing had a malignancy rate of 52.8% (57/108) and benignity rate of 47.2% (51/108). Of 21 patients with Bethesda III nodules who underwent GEC testing, 38.9% (7/18) had suspicious results and malignancy on final pathology with a sensitivity of 77.8% (7/9). Of 3 patients with benign GEC results, 2 (66.7%) had malignancy (FTC, n=2; MNH, n=1) on final pathology. Overall, patients with Bethesda III nodules and suspicious GEC results had a malignancy rate of 38.9% compared to a rate of 52.8% in patients with Bethesda III nodules without GEC testing.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In surgical patients with Bethesda III nodules, there was a greater than expected malignancy rate. However, in patients with Bethesda III nodules and GEC testing, malignancy rates were as predicted. GEC testing may have limited utility in surgical decision making, as this patient population is already highly selected for malignancy due to other factors. Surgeons should assess their local institutional experience to determine whether there is added utility of GEC testing for Bethesda III nodules in their everyday clinical practice.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

CT scan has traditionally been used to follow these lesions, however, given its excellent depiction of fluid containing lesions, and its lack of ionizing radiation, MRI has been increasingly utilized to assess these lesions. We sought to evaluate an initial experience and costs utilizing a novel pancreatic cyst-specific protocol for MRI. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A single center retrospective study was performed by searching an electronic imaging database for MRI pancreas studies from 2006-2014. After identification of the studies, the reports were examined to confirm that the indication for imaging was pancreatic cystic lesions. Retrospective chart review was used to assess demographics, imaging profiles (presence of other serial imaging &ndash; ex: CT), and the presence of interventions. Reimbursed costs of the studies were determined using the CMS physician fee data for the imaging procedures including both the professional and technical components, however contrast cost was not included. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 93 patients underwent an MRI pancreas protocol (average age: 65&plusmn;13, % female: 61.5%). All patients had one contrasted imaging scan (MRI or CT) during the study period. 9 of these patients underwent a surgical intervention for a pancreatic cyst - 5 with a definitive operation, while 4 underwent surgery, but required surveillance of cysts in the remaining pancreas. Surgery was most often indicated due to concerning features or size (n=6). An MRI pancreas was used to diagnose cyst change for 3/5 patients that had a definitive operation, while CT scan identified a change in imaging characteristics for the other 2 patients. 43 patients underwent EUS/FNA during the study period. The average follow-up was 39 months, with the time between studies being 8.2 months. Patients had, on average, a total of 4.9 scans over the 39 months (1.7 CT scans, 1.3 MRI w/contrast, and 1.8 MRI pancreas protocol scans) or 1.5 scans per year. MRI pancreas was more expensive than CT w/Contrast ($333 vs. $230), but with the absence of radiation and contrast related complications. Additionally, if the average patient were exclusively followed with CT scans; the overall cost savings would be minimal ($189).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our initial experience with the use of a novel pancreas protocol MRI is favorable, with minimal increase in cost. The lack of ionizing radiation and intravenous contrast with the MRI pancreas potocol, is an important consideration for patients undergoing serial imaging. The use of MRI for patients with pancreatic cystic disease shold be investigated further.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

The role of NLR in predicting pancreas cancer outcome is understudied. Previous reports have suggested that higher NLRs are associated with worse survival. We sought to investigate the relation between NLR and both short and long term outcomes after pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma resection in our institution.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients with pancreas cancer who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma between 1999 and 2012 were evaluated. NLR was calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophilic count value by the absolute lymphocytic count value. We identified 216 patients from our prospectively maintained database with 104 patients excluded for lack of data on neutrophilic or lymphocytic counts within 30 days prior to surgery. Out of 112 eligible patients analyzed, 33 (29.5%) had NLR &ge; 4.5.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There was no difference in 30-day mortality between patients with NLR &ge; 4.5 and those with NLR &lt; 4.5 (0 (0%) vs 1 (1.3%), p=0.5) and no differences in overall 30-day morbidity (16 (49%) vs 45 (57%), p=0.4). Patients with NLR &lt; 4.5 were more likely to have nodal metastases than their counterpart group (69 (87%) vs 16 (49%), p&lt;0.001), while patients with NLR &ge; 4.5 had a higher median estimated blood loss (EBL) (550 mL (150-12,500) vs 500 mL (150-1,400), p=0.02), a higher median number of intraoperatively-transfused packed red cell units (2 units (0-23) vs 0 units (0-9), p=0.01), and a longer hospital stay (LOS) (10 days (5-39) vs 8 days (4-35), p=0.04). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed improved median overall survival in the NLR &ge; 4.5 group (21 months vs 18 months, p=0.02). On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for nodal status, EBL, intraoperative packed red cell transfusion, NLRs &ge; 4.5  were found to be the only predictor of improved overall survival (HR=0.54 , CI=0.30 &ndash; 0.97, p=0.04) (Figure.1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In our experience of pancreas cancer patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy, elevated NLR was associated with an increased risk of EBL, need for transfusion, and longer LOS, but improved long-term survival. This is in contrast to previous reports describing elevated NLR as a negative prognostic variable.  Further studies on larger numbers of patients are required to better assess the prognostic role of preoperative NLR for both short and long-term outcomes after curative resection of pancreas cancer.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Although surgical resection was once thought to be the mainstay of therapy, this is a potentially morbid approach associated with a high risk of local recurrence. There is an increasing role for watchful waiting and conservative management for these tumors. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We identified 36 desmoid tumor patients who were categorized by the nature of treatment rendered (surgical resection versus observation). Data were abstracted on clinical and pathological factors.  Disease stability or progression was determined radiographically.   Univariate and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine predictors of recurrence/progression of disease.  Main outcome measurements were tumor recurrence following surgical resection versus tumor progression with conservative management. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the 36 patients, 58% were female and average age was 44 years old.  The tumors were primarily located in the extremities including hip and shoulder girdle at 58%. 33% were located in the trunk and 8% in the retoperitoneum.  Median tumor size was 9.2 cm (range 2.7-24 cm).  Of the patients that had beta catenin staining, 96% were positive.  The patients were categorized into surgical versus nonsurgical therapy.  18 patients underwent operation either prior to referral, due to refractory symptoms or due to patient preference. 17 patients were observed without surgical resection, including 3 patients who received nonsurgical therapy such as chemoradiation and/or medical therapy.  One patient was lost to follow up. Median follow up time was 23 months.Among 17 of the patients who underwent surgical resection, ten patients developed recurrent disease (59%).  Among those who developed recurrent disease, 8 (80%) patients were stable or partially responding to subsequent observation.  Of the 17 patients who underwent conservative management, one patient experienced disease progression (5%) and 94% of patients had no disease progression, including one patient with complete response and three patients with partial responses.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This retrospective analysis adds to growing data that observation of both primary and recurrent desmoid tumors is safe and effective with higher rates of stable disease than other published series.

There is a lack of consensus regarding the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes in HIV-infected patients with HCC. We compared the clinical presentation, treatment, and survival of patients with HCC, with and without HIV infection.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We linked the Texas cancer registry to the HIV/AIDS data for all years between 2001 and 2011. Patient demographics, socioeconomic status, cancer stage, and treatment were compared between patients with HCC and patients with HCC and HIV. Using a standard HIV population, we calculated annual age, sex, and race standardized incidence and all-cause mortality of HCC in patients with and without HIV.  We estimated standardized incidence and mortality ratios for the entire study period. We calculated the fraction of mortality related to the following cause-of-death categories: HCC, end-stage liver disease, and HIV. We used a shared frailty model to evaluate risk-adjusted survival in patients with HCC and HIV and with HCC only. We explored the association between HIV infection and treatment of HCC using a mixed-effects logistic regression model.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:18,291 patients with HCC were included in the study; 236 had HIV infection.

Increasing age and income were significantly associated with increased likelihood that the support received was just right (p&lt;0.006).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Most patients undergoing CRC treatment reported high social support from all sources. However, black and lower income patients were at risk for low support or support that did not meet their needs. Spouse/partner support was important and met needs, but was only available to 58% of respondents. In future work, we will examine how social support affects long-term outcomes for CRC patients.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Prior evidence demonstrates treatment and survival disparities between black and white patients.  Our study examines receipt of surgery and overall survival by race, using novel data from a large population cancer database.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using the National Cancer Data Base Participant User Files from 2003 to 2011, we identified PA patients with potentially resectable (T1-3M0) disease.  Only patients resected with curative intent were included.  Univariate, and multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were used to examine resection and survival.  Multivariate models were adjusted for demographic factors, comorbidities, T stage, tumor size, facility type, and facility volume (20 or more resections/year = high volume).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 33,255 patients with potentially resectable disease, 3,727 (11.2%) were black and 27,908 (85.2%) were white.  Black patients had lower odds of undergoing resection as compared with their white patients on univariate (OR 0.69 [95% CI 0.65-0.74, p&lt;0.0001] and multivariable logistic regression (OR 0.64 [95% CI 0.58-0.71], p&lt;0.0001).  There was no significant difference in the refusal of surgery by race.  By univariate survival analyses, resected patients survived 11.2 months longer in median survival time than unresected patients and had a lower hazard of death (HR 0.39 [95% CI 0.37-0.41], p&lt;0.0001) while across both resected and unresected, black patients had a higher hazard of death and a reduced median survival time (HR 1.10 [95% CI 1.02-1.17], p=0.007; 9 vs. 9.66 months).  This persisted in a multivariable Cox regression model that did not account for treatment factors (HR 1.10 [95% CI 1.01-1.21], p=0.03).  Survival by race was similar after controlling for method of treatment (Table 1). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our analyses demonstrate the importance of treating patients with resectable disease the same irrespective of race.  Black patients are at much lower odds of resection as compared with white patients, but they have similar survival in multivariate models when they do undergo resection.  These data highlight the importance of improving access to resection for all potential resectable PA patients.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Initial investigations on surgical decision-making reported that a patient's choice was related to socioeconomic status (SES), geographic location, patient characteristics, and physician influence. However, little research has been conducted on the influence of tumor characteristics on surgical decision-making.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective analysis of the 2002-2010 University of Nebraska Breast Cancer Collaborative Registry was performed. The demographic, medical history, and tumor characteristics of patients were compared between oncologic surgery decision groups (BCT, unilateral mastectomy, bilateral mastectomy) in a univariate analysis. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed on the predictor variables that were associated with the outcome variable of surgical decision to the 0.2 significance level. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:320 women were included with 100 receiving BCT, 176 unilateral mastectomy, and 44 bilateral mastectomy. On univariate analysis, factors associated with surgery decision were bilateral carcinoma (p=0.0001), staging (p=0.0006), tumor metastasis (p=0.02), tumor histology (p=0.03), BRCA mutation (p=0.04), unilateral multifocal lesions (p=0.047), and lymphoma history (p=0.04). On multinomial analysis, tumor stage and bilateral carcinoma were independently associated with treatment decision. Patients with bilateral tumors had 12.1 times higher odds of choosing bilateral mastectomy (95% OR CI: 2.3-63.3, p=0.003). When compared to patients with in situ tumors, stage II patients had 8.8 times higher odds of choosing bilateral mastectomy (p=0.048) and a 2.9 times higher odds of choosing a unilateral mastectomy (p=0.02). Subjects with stage III tumors had 32.1 times higher odds of choosing bilateral mastectomy than those with in situ tumors (p=0.007), and 13.6 times higher odds of choosing a unilateral mastectomy (p=0.0003). Stage IV patients had 36.1 times higher odds of choosing a bilateral mastectomy than those with in situ tumors (p=0.009), and an 11.5 times higher odds of choosing a unilateral mastectomy (p=0.004).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our findings suggest that our patients' decision of surgical procedure had greater association with tumor characteristics rather than demographic or medical history, as previously demonstrated in other studies. Women with stage II-IV BC and bilateral tumors are still more likely to opt for more extensive surgical interventions despite evidence to the safety, efficacy, and comparable survival rates of more conservative treatments in patients with stages I-III, and well established education on surgical options. Patients with in situ and stage I BC may be more willing to undergo BCT, underscoring the efficacy of current patient education endeavors.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

The aim of this study is to assess the correlation between the mathematical prediction model to and ultrasound and histopathology findings for in vivo ablations in a porcine model.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: IRE ablations were performed on porcine liver and spleen with probe spacings ranging from 0.6 to 2.6 cm.  Pre and 2 hour post-ablation ultrasound images were recorded and validated with histopathology confirmation.  Three dimensions of the ablation regions were recorded and ablation volumes were calculated and correlated with theoretical mathematical models for each given probe spacing.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In-vivo axial and anterior-posterior (AP) ablation distances were significantly greater than predicted for nearly all probe spacings (p&lt;0.05).  Ablation volumes were significantly less than predicted for the all probe spacings when modeled using both a cylinder and an ellipsoid.  Geometrically, mathematically derived ablation regions demonstrated more central tapering ('necking') and diminished volumes compared to their in-vivo counterparts.  The relationships between probe spacing and AP ablation dimensions were less linear (r<sup>2</sup>=0.57) than the relationships observed via ultrasound.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The current mathematical models poorly predict ablation regions observed in vivo.   They underestimate ablation dimensions and, by extension, ablation volumes.

Our objective was to assess incidence, demographics, treatment patterns, and long-term survival of this disease through a population based analysis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify patients aged 0-21 diagnosed with CWES from 1973-2011.  Patients were grouped by decade to assess changes in treatment patterns and outcomes.  The effects of clinical, demographic, and treatment variables on overall survival were assessed by the computation of Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test, with Cox proportional hazard regression used for multivariate analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 193 pediatric patients with histologically-confirmed CWES were identified.  The disease was more common in males (60.6%), whites (92.2%), and 11-17 year-olds (48.7%).  It was metastatic at presentation in 36.8% of patients.  When grouped approximately by decade, 10-year overall survival improved progressively from 38.2% in 1973-1979 to 65.4% in 2000-2011 (p=0.033).  The use of radiation decreased from 84.2% in the earliest time period to 40.0% in the most recent, while the proportion of patients receiving surgery increased from 75.0% to 84.9%.

Volumetric analysis of the liver in addition to standard assessment of patient performance status and liver function can help determine the ideal treatment plan for patients with  risk factors for postoperative liver insufficiency such as cirrhosis and hepatic steatosis. Analysis using Pathfinder Scout,&trade; which utilizes contrasted CT or MRI data, can provide accurate future liver remnant (FLR) volume and guide assessment of resectability.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Between 2009 and 2015, 50 patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center were evaluated for liver resection using Pathfinder Scout&trade;. After approval by the Institutional Review Board, the medical record of each patient was reviewed for pertinent clinical information. Data extracted from the records included preoperative diagnosis, laboratory data, type of resection planned, final pathological findings, and postoperative complications such as liver insufficiency. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Optimal candidates for liver resection were defined as good performance status, FLR&gt;35%, and limited risk factors. Risk factors for liver insufficiency were defined as hepatic steatosis by imaging or biopsy, fibrosis, or cirrhosis. Sixteen patients were deemed unresectable based on FLR &lt; 35% (n=12) or adequate FLR but possessed one or more risk factors (n=4). An additional 3 resections were intraoperatively aborted due to vascular invasion or additional lesions. Four of the unresectable patients underwent locoregional therapy (LRT e.g. radiofrequency ablation, chemoembolization, radioembolization) and/or systemic therapy; two of the patients were rendered resectable.   Eight patients underwent portal vein embolization (PVE) and 4 patients' FLR improved above 35% leading to resection. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Formal volumetric assessment prior to liver resection is an important consideration for patients with cirrhosis, steatosis, and multifocal disease.  Based on volumetric data 24 % of patients in our cohort underwent LRT rather than resection, mitigating the risks of liver failure postresection in these patients.  In addition to standard assessment of liver function and performance status, volumetric analysis of the FLR can determine the success of PVE as an adjunct to improve FLR.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Lew<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Miami,Division Of Endocrine Surgery, DeWitt Daughtry Family Department Of Surgery,Miami, FL, USA <sup>2</sup>University Of Miami,Department Of Radiology,Miami, FL, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Many recent studies suggest unenhanced CT attenuation values expressed in Hounsfield units (HU) are superior for differentiating between benign and malignant adrenal tumors. Surgical removal is warranted when the risk of malignancy is significant (i.e. adrenal tumor &gt;4cm), or if the tumor is hyperfunctional biochemically. With recent enthusiasm for its use to differentiate between benign and malignant adrenal tumors, the purpose of this study was to determine if HU are more effective than tumor size by unenhanced CT in predicting adrenal malignancy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of prospectively collected data of 40 patients who underwent adrenalectomies with reviewable unenhanced transverse CT scans at a single institution was performed. Based on final pathology, 32 patients had benign adrenal tumors and 8 had malignant tumors. CT densities were obtained in HU by placement of a region of interest (ROI) over the adrenal gland, avoiding any necrotic or hemorrhagic areas. Adrenal tumor size was determined using the maximum diameter on transverse CT views. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 cm; and at 10, 20, 30, and 40 HU were also compared. Size and HU on CT were compared for benign and malignant adrenal tumors using unpaired T-tests.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 40 patients studied, those with benign adrenal tumors had statistically (p&lt;0.001) smaller diameters (3.6cm +/- 1.5) than malignant tumors (7.7cm +/- 4.4) [ROC curve 0.813, p&lt;0.05]. The mean HU of benign tumors (26.5HU +/- 27) were not significantly different (p=0.28) compared to malignant tumors (37.8HU +/- 21) [ROC curve 0.659, p=0.169]. Unenhanced CT had a sensitivity of &gt;85% and specificity of &lt;55% for adrenal tumors measuring 2 to 4cm and a sensitivity of &lt;63% and specificity &gt;70% for tumors measuring 5 to 6cm. PPV, NPV, and accuracy for determining malignancy in adrenal tumors by size were: 24.2%, 100%, and 35.9% respectively at 2cm; 25.9%, 91.7%, and 46.2% at 3cm; 33.3%, 94.4%, and 61.5% at 4cm; 35.7%, 88%, and 69.2% at 5cm; and 80%, 88.2%, and 87.2% at 6cm. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for determining malignancy in adrenal tumors by HU were: 100%, 16.1%, 23.5%, 100%, and 33.3% respectively at 10HU; 87.5%, 32.3%, 25%, 90.9%, and 43.6% at 20HU; 62.5%, 54.8%, 26.3%, 85%, and 56.4% at 30HU; and 50%, 83.9%, 44.4%, 86.7%, and 76.9% at 40HU. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study suggests adrenal tumor size remains a better predictor for adrenal malignancy than HU on unenhanced CT. At 4cm, tumor size has a better sensitivity and specificity for predicting adrenal malignancy than HU. Furthermore, at 2cm or less, size is a more reliable predictor of adrenal benignity than HU. While use of HU has gained popularity, surgeons should remain confident in using tumor size as a criterion for those patients who require adrenalectomies.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Standard parametric and nonparametric statistical analyses were used to evaluate the 30-day morbidity and mortality associated with lung resection and compare outcomes among patients with and without DMa.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among DMa patients, 200 (33.2%) were diagnosed with primary lung cancer, 357 (59.2%) had metastases to the lung, and 46 (7.6%) were unspecified. Most DMa patients had independent functional status (99.2%) and were without any dyspnea symptoms (84.4%). Overall 30-day morbidity, serious morbidity and mortality for DMa patients were 12.1%, 7.6% and 1.8%, respectively, and 95.9% of patients were discharged home. DMa patients with a primary diagnosis of lung cancer had a significantly greater mortality compared to patients with lung metastases (3.5% vs. 0.6%, p &lt; 0.01). Pneumonectomy among DMa patients had far worse overall morbidity, serious morbidity and mortality compared to other types of lung resections (28.6% vs 12.1%, 28.6% vs 7.6%, and 7.1% vs 1.8%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05). Of most clinical significance, when comparing outcomes for DMa versus non-DMa, overall morbidity was lower among DMa patients (12.1% vs. 15.4%, p &lt; 0.05) and there were no significant differences in serious morbidity (8.3% vs. 9.8%, p &gt; 0.05) or mortality (1.8% vs. 1.8%, p &gt; 0.05) for all lung resections. Subgroup analysis by segmentectomy, wedge resection, lobectomy and pneumonectomy also demonstrated no significant differences in rates of overall morbidity, serious morbidity and mortality for DMa versus non-DMa patients (p &gt; 0.05 for all).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: With the exception of pneumonectomy, DMa patients undergoing pulmonary resections experienced low rates of overall morbidity, serious morbidity, and mortality. Moreover, surgical outcomes for pulmonary resections were comparable among DMa and non-DMA patients. Taken together, these data suggest that lung resections may be performed safely on select patients with DMa with both primary lung cancer and pulmonary metastatic disease, with important implications for both symptom palliation and multimodality care.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Kimchi<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Medical University Of South Carolina,Division Of Surgical Oncology,Charleston, Sc, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is one of the strongest prognostic indicators of survival in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC). Despite the improvements in imaging modalities, sensitivity of CT scan assessment for LNM still is low. The value of regional lymph node dissection for IHCC is an area of debate. Routine nodal dissection has been investigated to aid in prognostication and as a possible preventive measure for disease recurrence. In this study we investigate the incidence of LNM and factors affecting metastasis in a large epidemiological database.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A SEER (Survival Epidemiology and End Results) case listing was acquired for histologically proven IHCC diagnosed between 1988-2011. Patients over 18 years of age, who underwent surgical therapy  with known tumor size, T-stage, number of lymph nodes dissected, lymph node positivity, location of lymph nodes, M status, type of surgery performed, tumor grade, disease extension and vascular invasion status  were selected for analyses.  For patients with positive lymph a binary logistic regression analysis was performed with SPSS 21 and factors affecting lymph node positivity were analyzed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Of the 9846 patients, 569 fit our criteria of whom 53.6% were female. Mean age was 62.9 years (21-85), mean tumor size was 5.9 cm (0.3-19), and lymph nodes were sampled in 261(45.8%) patients (mean 4.5 nodes, n=1-32). Among the patients who underwent lymph node sampling, 115 (44%) had nodal disease (hepatoduodenal n=110, inferior phrenic n=1, unspecified n=3, combined n=1).  Binary regression analysis showed tumor grade, T stage (vascular invasion, extension of the tumor to extrahepatic bile ducts) to be significant factors associated lymph node positivity. The number of lesions, patient age, tumor size, involvement of contiguous sites, presence of metastatic disease and sex were found to be insignificant.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The number of LNM in this patient cohort was similar to other reports where findings of routine nodal dissections are published.  Identification of patients with high risk features such as high grade tumors, vascular invasion and extension to extrahepatic bile ducts may aid in selection of patients for lymph node dissection. Performed at experienced institutions, lymph node dissection may aid in staging of IHCC, however further studies are needed to confirm our findings.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Many studies with CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody have demonstrated antitumor activity in advanced melanoma and other solid tumors with varying degrees of treatment related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects. This study sought to determine the incidence of CTLA-4 blockade-associated severe GI adverse effects, risk stratified by the type of malignancy treated, and to investigate dosage related risk of severe diarrhea or colitis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials was completed. Keywords searched were &lsquo;ipilimumab', &lsquo;Yervoy', &lsquo;MDX-010', &lsquo;MDX101', &lsquo;tremelimumab', &lsquo;ticilimumab', &lsquo;diarrhea', &lsquo;colitis', and &lsquo;clinical trial'. All clinical trials were analyzed for patient recruitment, intervention, and outcomes. Incidence and risk ratio (RR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:13 single or double arm, phase II/III clinical trials involving 4,383 patients treated with ipilimumab or tremelimumab were identified. The incidence of CTLA-4 blockade associated severe (grade 3-4) diarrhea was 9.5% (95% CI [5.4-16.2]; p&lt;0.0001) and severe colitis was 6.3% (95% CI [4.9-8.0]; p&lt;0.001) among 1,464 patients in 9 clinical trials in which CTLA-4 blockade monotherapy was used in a single arm trial or RCT. Among 4,383 ipilimumab or tremelimumab treated patients in 10 RCTs, the risk of severe diarrhea in the treatment group was 9% compared to 1.5% in control (RR 4.18, 95% CI [1.44-12.15]; p=0.009) while severe colitis in the treatment group was 5.3% compared to 0.2% in the control (RR 11.53, 95% CI [3.65-36.44]; p=&lt;0.001). The incidence and risk of severe CTLA-4 blockade-associated GI adverse events were not significantly different between melanoma and solid tumor, between 3mg and 10mg dosage regimens, or when monotherapy and/or concomitant chemotherapy were used. Significant heterogeneity was found among identified trials with regards to underlying malignancies, the dosage of the treatment, and duration of the treatment.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:CTLA-4 blockade is associated with a significantly increased risk of all- and high-grade diarrhea and colitis. Altering in dosing regimens or combinational chemotherapy utilizing CTLA-4 blockade did not significantly reduce the risk of GI adverse events. Although adequately powered large studies are needed to further investigate contributing risk factors for the GI adverse events, GI adverse events should be carefully monitored in patients treated with CTLA-4 blockade.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Previous studies have reported conflicting results. Thus, we sought to evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on both short-term postoperative outcomes and long-term survival after potentially curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer in a large, single institution cohort of US patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We identified 442 patients who underwent potentially curative gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma between 1995 and 2014. Clinicopathologic characteristics, operative details, lymph node yield, postoperative complications, and oncologic outcomes were collected, and patients were stratified according to BMI as underweight (BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), normal weight (BMI 18.5 &ndash; 24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0 &ndash; 29.9), and obese (BMI &ge; 30). We controlled for clinically relevant confounders using Cox logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of five-year mortality. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Most patients had a normal BMI (n = 175, 39.6%), followed by overweight (n = 159, 36.0%), obese (n = 83, 18.8%), and underweight patients (n = 25, 5.7%). Overweight and obese patients were more likely to be young and male and to undergo esophagogastrectomy than underweight and normal weight patients, though there were no differences in tumor location, tumor stage, or extent of lymphadenectomy across groups. When stratified by BMI, there were no significant differences in the overall postoperative complication rates or in the rates of specific types or grades of complications. Specifically, there were no differences in the 30-day incidence of wound infection, anastomotic leak, or death across the BMI groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the length of stay or readmission rates across BMI groups. For the entire cohort, the median number of examined and positive lymph nodes was 18 and 2, respectively, and there was no difference in lymph node yield across the BMI groups. BMI was not an independent predictor of overall survival (P &gt; 0.05) (see Figure).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In contrast to what many groups have previously reported, we found that BMI has no impact on postoperative complication rates, nodal yields, or long-term survival in patients undergoing potentially curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

IntegriSense 750 (Perkin Elmer) is a targeted fluorescent imaging agent composed of a selective a<sub>v</sub>?b<sub>3</sub> antagonist and a near-infrared fluorochrome. We hypothesize IntegriSense 750 can effectively produce contrast for applications in fluorescence-guided surgery as demonstrated in flank xenograft, orthotopic tongue, and lymph node metastatic disease models of head and neck cancer. A dose escalation study was performed at three doses (1.25&mu;g/mouse, 2.5&mu;g/mouse, and 5&mu;g/mouse) in mice bearing luc+ SCC1 flank xenografts (n=5). Mice bearing orthotopic tongue (n=3) and lymph node (n=3) models received 2.5&mu;g of IntegriSense 750 per mouse. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Fluorescence imaging was performed twice daily after infusion using commercially available open-field NIR and closed-field NIR imaging systems. NIR renderings of resected specimens were compared to bioluminescence images to confirm localization of probe to tumor. Tissue fluorescence was correlated with histology. Progressively smaller tumor fragments were re-introduced into the wound bed in order to determine the smallest cancerous mass detectable using this agent. Exploratory surgeries were performed to demonstrate agent localization to orthotopic tumors and lymph node metastases. A biodistribution study was performed four days after dosing. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Intraoperative imaging successfully differentiated tumor from normal tissue with mean tumor-to-background ratios of 3.73, 5.35, and 9.62 on day 4 for the 1.25&mu;g, 2.5&mu;g, and 5&mu;g doses, respectively. Tumor-to-background ratios for all three groups peaked at four days post-infusion. Tumor fragments as small as 0.5mg were visualized in all three dosing cohorts. 3/3 diseased lymph nodes were fluorescently visible in situ in mice during exploratory surgeries. The 5&mu;g dose was found to be the optimal dose for applications in fluorescence-guided surgical oncology in this study.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:IntegriSense 750 appeared to be effective for use in fluorescence-guided surgical applications as demonstrated in flank xenograft, orthotopic, and lymph node metastatic disease models of head and neck cancer.","Basic Science","Growth Factors/Receptors/Signal Transduction","Oncology"

Frequently, the appendix is not fully visualized, and these equivocal US result in subsequent computed tomography scans (CT) or admissions. Our purpose was to determine if the inclusion of secondary signs (SS) observed in equivocal RLQ US reports improves diagnostic accuracy.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using retrospective chart review, we identified 825 children (ages 5&ndash;18 years) presenting to a pediatric emergency department with concern for appendicitis and a RLQ US. Final US reports were evaluated for primary and SS of appendicitis. The primary sign of appendicitis was a fully visualized appendix (unequivocal US) with a diameter &ge;6mm. SS included fluid collections representative of an abscess, significant free fluid, echogenic fat, regional hyperemia, enlarged lymph nodes, hypoperistalsis of adjacent bowel, and appendicoliths. US reports were classified into four categories: 1. Normal; 2. Equivocal without SS; 3. Equivocal with SS; and 4. Appendicitis. Review of operative and pathology reports confirmed appendicitis. Logistic regression models identified which SS were associated with appendicitis, and test characteristics were calculated.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 825 patients, 530 (64%) had equivocal US reports resulting in 114 (22%) CT and 172 (32%) admissions. Of the 114 patients with equivocal US undergoing CT, those with SS were more likely to have appendicitis (48.6% vs 14.6%, p&lt;0.001). Of the 172 patients with equivocal US admitted for observation, those with SS were more likely to have appendicitis (61.0% vs 33.6%, p&lt;0.001). On univariate analyses, all SS were associated with appendicitis except enlarged lymph nodes. After fully adjusting for age, sex, race, and other SS, the SS that were associated with appendicitis included fluid collection (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 13.3, 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) 2.1-82.8), hyperemia (OR 11.97, 95%CI 1.5 &ndash; 95.5), free fluid (OR 9.78, 95%CI 3.8 &ndash; 25.4), and appendicolith (OR 7.86, 95%CI 1.7 &ndash; 37.2). Wall thickness, hypoperistalsis of adjacent bowel and echogenic fat were not associated with appendicitis in the fully adjusted model.   There was no difference in accuracy in the categorization of cases as normal or appendicitis between unequivocal US and equivocal US when SS were used (Table).  Equivocal US that included hyperemia, a fluid collection, or an appendicolith had a specificity of 96% and accuracy of 88%.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is potential to improve the diagnosis of appendicitis. When using SS, equivocal US are as accurate as unequivocal US. Appropriate use of SS can guide clinicians and reduce unnecessary CT and admissions.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

DeUgarte<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>UCLA And Harbor-UCLA,Department Of Surgery - Division Of Pediatric Surgery,Los Angeles, CA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Several non-operative strategies have been described to repair gastroschisis  including 'sutureless', 'ward reduction', 'plastic', and 'flap' techniques. Non-operative strategies have the potential advantages of avoiding intubation and general anesthesia, decreasing pain, and improving cosmesis.  Their disadvantage is that the majority of patients without formal fascial closure will develop hernias, a proportion of which will require delayed repair. We hypothesized that routine utilization of non-operative strategy results in cost-savings in uncomplicated cases of gastroschisis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   We constructed a decision tree to compare three different strategies for the management of uncomplicated gastroschisis: non-operative management, primary operative closure, and routine silo placement.  Model variables (including probability of management failure and hernia development as well as anticipated length of stay and treatment costs) were abstracted from a literature review and the Medicare Physician Fee schedule. Uncertainty surrounding model parameters was assessed via one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  According to our model, non-operative management of uncomplicated gastroschisis was the least costly strategy, which cost $198,085 per patient. Primary closure cost $208,763 per patient. Routine silo placement was the most costly, $239,038 per patient.  One-way sensitivity analysis suggested the cost of primary closure would be less costly than non-operative management if the initial success rate of non-operative management was less than 35.4% or if the initial success rate of primary operative closure was greater than 87.8%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that non-operative management was the least costly strategy among 97.4% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Non-operative management of uncomplicated gastroschisis appears to be more cost-effective than attempted primary closure and routine silo placement strategies.  Furthermore, given the potential for avoiding general anesthesia, routine adoption of non-operative management of uncomplicated gastroschisis should be considered and deserves prospective evaluation.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

There is a paucity of strong evidence supporting the efficacy of iNO for CDH patients. We sought to identify the spectrum of iNO use among CDH patients and the correlation between iNO use and important clinical variables and outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed an analysis of data from the international CDH Study Group registry, which comprises voluntary and prospectively collected data from over 60 international centers. We analyzed the following variables: iNO use/dose, gestational age, defect size, pulmonary hypertension (pHTN) as defined by right ventricular systolic pressure &gt;2/3 systemic systolic pressure, operative characteristics, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use.  Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U test, and regression analyses were performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 3,367 patients were identified from 2007-2015. iNO was used in 2,047 (61%) of all patients.  The median (range) iNO dose was 20 (0.1-80 ppm), treatment duration was 8 (0-100 days), and day of life at initiation was 1 (0-189 days). Seventy (3%) patients received 2 iNO treatments, and 7 had &gt;2 treatment periods. Of those patients with evaluable pHTN data (n=3117, 93%), 2,174 (70%) had pHTN, of which 1,613 (74%) were treated with iNO. Of the 943 patients without pHTN, 343 (37%) were treated with iNO. On multivariate regression analysis, iNO use was associated with worse pHTN on initial echocardiogram, larger defect size, ECMO use, and center (all p&lt;0.05).  Mean iNO use by center was 62% (0-100%) and its use was inversely associated with the trend in survival (Figure). On multivariate regression analysis, mortality was significantly associated with iNO use (OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.9-4.1), ECMO use (OR 4.1, 95%CI 3.1-5.3), and defect size (A: reference; B: OR 3.4, 95%CI 1.2-9.6; C: OR 8.9, 95%CI 3.2-25; D: OR 18, 95%CI 6.7-52).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our analysis revealed that iNO use is associated with pHTN, ECMO use, and defect size.

Fluid restriction is typical on ECMO, and on occasion ultrafiltration (UF) is used as a rescue measure. Since early 2012, our institution established a protocol introducing the routine use of ultrafiltration on ECMO (ECMO-UF). We hypothesized that routine ultrafiltration on ECMO (ECMO-UF) is associated with better fluid management, shorter ECMO duration, improved nutritional status and ultimately better long term outcomes without compromising renal function post-ECMO.   <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review of CDH cases from January 2004 to January 2015 was conducted at a pediatric tertiary center. Neonates with CDH who required ECMO therapy were included in the analysis. ECMO-UF was started within the first 6-12 hours of ECMO initiation in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Prior to this, UF use was rarely used as rescue modality (ECMO group). Outcomes of patients admitted after 2012(ECMO-UF) were compared to the ECMO group. Net fluid balance, nutritional status after 48 hours on ECMO, renal function, survival and long term pulmonary outcomes were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U Test for continuous measurement and Fischer's exact for categorical measurement. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:During the study period 214 CDH patients were cared for, 62 (29%) patients required ECMO. Of these, 15 (24%) had UF initiated within 6-12 hours after ECMO cannulation. Patients in the ECMO-UF group had significantly greater caloric intake with higher TPN rates at 48 hours, 47.7+11.1 vs 65.7+11 (p&lt;0.01), and greater total fluid output on ECMO (p=0.017). There was no significant difference in renal function. No significance was seem in length of tracheal intubation, with a median number of days of 37 (20-359) in the ECMO group vs 42 (20-186) in the ECMO-UF (p=0.91). Overall 6 month survival was equivalent in both group 62.2% vs 60.9%, (p=0.25).      <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The use of routine UF allows for better optimization of parenteral nutrition while maintaining a more favorable net fluid balance without adverse effect on renal function.

This study aimed to determine whether 1) the propensity for concurrent fundoplication during gastrostomy varies among hospitals, and 2) whether postoperative morbidities differ significantly among institutions performing fundoplication more or less frequently. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (ACS-NSQIP-P) dataset was queried to identify children who underwent gastrostomy with or without concurrent fundoplication.  We created a hierarchical multivariate regression to model the propensity for concurrent fundoplication.  The model included preoperative clinical variables associated with concurrent fundoplication after gastrostomy.  The excess effects that hospitals exerted over the propensity of concurrent fundoplication were estimated as odds ratios.  Hospitals were identified as having low, intermediate, or high odds ratios for the use of concurrent fundoplication. The risk-adjusted postoperative morbidity rates were compared among hospitals designated as low outliers, average hospitals, and high outliers in odds of concurrent fundoplication.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 3,775 children underwent gastrostomy at 54 ACS-NSQIP-P participating hospitals between 2011-2013.  The mean concurrent fundoplication rate was 11.7% (unadjusted range 0% to 64%). There was no significant difference in unadjusted morbidity rate in children with concurrent fundoplication, 11.0% compared to 9.7% in children without concurrent fundoplication.  After controlling for clinical variables, 8 hospitals were identified as low outliers (mean observed fundoplication rate of 0.4%) and 16 hospitals were high outliers (mean observed fundoplication rate of 34.6%). The average unadjusted morbidity rate among hospitals with low, intermediate and high odds of concurrent fundoplication were 9.6%, 10.6% and 8.6% respectively (p=0.78). The added morbidity rate attributed to a concurrent fundoplication among hospitals with low, intermediate and high odds of concurrent fundoplication were 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.1% respectively (p=0.34).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Hospitals appear to vary significantly in propensity for concurrent fundoplication during gastrostomy in this small observational dataset yet short term morbidity did not differ significantly among the groups.  These findings could demonstrate the need to clarify indications for concurrent fundoplication and the need for longer follow up to evaluate the success as well as morbidity of the procedure over time.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

As such, health systems must optimize value without sacrificing safety or outcomes. Elective surgical procedures represent one healthcare area that may be value-enhanced by moving to a more cost-efficient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and cost of performing the removal of implantable central venous access devices ('ports') in settings other than the main OR.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We compared port removal in three settings, specifically: 1) Main OR, 2) Satellite OR, and 3) Clinic procedure room. This was a mixed-methods study, including a retrospective review of health records and prospective observation/interviewing. To calculate cost without the inherent biases of hospital charges, costs, and payments, we utilized the methodology of Time-Driven Activity Based Costing. Specifically, we recorded time spent by the patient in hospital facilities and with hospital personnel. This duration was weighted with the hourly cost of each professional and hospital space. Demographic information and 30-day procedure-related complications data were obtained retrospectively. Time spent by the patient was obtained retrospectively from electronic timestamps. When this information was unavailable, a proxy was obtained from the median time spent during prospective observation. The Mann-Whitney U test compared the continuous variables of time and cost across the three sites. Overall cost at each site was divided by overall cost at the referent site (Main OR) to obtain a ratio of cost savings.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 120 patients (40 per site) were included in the analysis. Demographic and clinical factors were not significantly different between sites. No complication occurred with port removal at any site. Patients in the Main OR spent more time in the procedure room, which was the highest-cost space (Main OR median 56 min vs. Satellite OR 42 min, P&lt;0.001; vs. Clinic 41 min, P&lt;0.001). Median overall cost was decreased by 25% in the Clinic (ratio=0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.66-0.87) and by 6% in the Satellite OR (ratio=0.94, 95% CI=0.89-1.02), compared to the Main OR (referent; P&lt;0.01). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this study, port removal in the Clinic procedure room was significantly more cost-effective and not significantly associated with an increased risk of negative outcomes, compared to port removal in the Main OR. Re-locating routine port removal to a non-OR setting, such as a clinic procedure room, appears to be safe and may result in substantial cost savings.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Methods of RRT in neonates include peritoneal dialysis (PD), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and intermittent hemodialysis (HD). The purpose of this study was to assess morbidity and mortality following initiation of dialysis in newborn patients (&lt;30 days) on those modalities.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who had RRT initiated in the first 30 days of life between 2006 and 2014, excluding patients receiving RRT following congenital heart surgery. All charts were queried for birth history, underlying etiology for RRT, operative history, and route of RRT (HD and/or PD). We also reviewed the surgical complications associated with RRT and mortality rate.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Total of 49 patients were identified, 39 boys and 10 girls. Median gestational age and birth weight were 36 (30-41) weeks and 2.85 (1.66-4.52) kg respectively. Thirty-two patients (65%) had end stage renal disease (ESRD), 11 (22%) had inborn errors of metabolism and 6 (12%) required dialysis due to other pathologies. Initial therapy was continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) in all patients. Median age at onset of RRT was 6 (4-14) days and median weight of 3.1 (2.7-4.0) kg. Patients with ESRD spent a median of 8.5 (2-38) days on CVVH, while metabolic error and other etiology patients spent a median of 4 (3-7) days and 4.5 (1-10) days respectively. Overall mortality was 65.3% (71.9% among ESRD patients, 45.5% metabolic disease). Fifty-six percent (18 of 32 total deaths) of all deaths occurring within the 1<sup>st</sup> 30 days of life and 94% (30 of 32) occurred within the 1<sup>st</sup> year of life. Most common cause of death was sepsis (30%) among ESRD patients, and ARDS (40%) among metabolic patients. Total of 201 surgeries were performed. Excluding catheter revisions, 83 new HD lines and 28 new PD catheters placed, with a maximum of 6 HD lines and 4 PD lines placed in a single patient. Two patients died within 24 hours of catheter placement due to respiratory failure. Catheter-associated morbidities occurred in 100% of patients. Most common complications for HD included circuit clotting (87%), bleeding (68%) and bacteremia (40%), and for PD patients included peritonitis (83%), catheter complications (72%), and PD catheter leaks (55%). Among 9 survivors that required long term RRT (median follow-up of 5.3 years), 4 were severely and 2 were moderately developmentally delayed.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: RRT is increasingly utilized for the neonatal population with renal and metabolic diseases. However, while RRT is becoming more technically feasible, it remains associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

However, it is controversial whether complicated appendicitis is associated with prehospital factors (age, symptom duration, serum sodium, and WBC count) or in-hospital factors (time from admission to appendectomy).  We investigate which of these factors are associated with predicting complicated appendicitis.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of all pediatric patients (&le;12 years) with appendicitis treated with appendectomy between 2000-2013 was performed.  The main outcome measure was intraoperative confirmation of gangrenous or perforated appendicitis.  A multivariable analysis was performed and the main predictors of interest were age, symptom duration &gt;24 hours, leukocytosis (WBC count &gt;12 10<sup>3</sup>/ml), hyponatremia (sodium &lt;135 mEq/L), and time from admission to appendectomy. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 392 patients, 179 (46%) had complicated appendicitis at the time of operation. Results of univariate analysis are listed in Table 1.  Predictors of complicated appendicitis on multivariable analysis included symptom duration &gt;24 hours (OR=5.1, 95% CI=3.2-8.2, p&lt;0.001), hyponatremia (OR=3.2, 95% CI=2-5.1, p&lt;0.001), age &lt;5 years (OR=2.7, 95% CI=1.3-5.4, p=0.007), and leukocytosis (OR=1.9, 95%CI=1-3.4, p=0.04).  Increased time from admission to appendectomy was not a predictor of complicated appendicitis (OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.5-1.1, p=0.2).<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Complicated appendicitis is a prehospital occurrence. Hyponatremia is a novel marker associated with complicated appendicitis and may be more predictive than WBC count or age.  Delaying appendectomy does not increase the risk of complicated appendicitis.  This information may help guide resource/personnel allocation, timing of appendectomy, and decision for non-operative management of appendicitis in children.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

However, these practices are not always adopted by non-pediatric specialties. We hypothesized that within a metropolitan hospital system (one children's hospital (CH) and eight non-children's hospitals (NCHs)), use of pre-operative CT is much higher in NCHs. We aimed to determine differences in pre-operative imaging and any associated demographic variables.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective study of patients &lt;18 years undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis from April 2012 to April 2015 in a 9-hospital system was conducted. Patient demographics, pre-operative location, and imaging modality (computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US)) were evaluated. Patients were attributed to the hospital in which the pre-operative imaging was performed and not the location of appendectomy. Chi-squared, Student's t-test, and multivariate regression were performed; p&lt;0.05 was significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1448 pediatric patients were identified (CH=215, 15%; NCHs=1233, 85%). The median (range) number of patients triaged per NCH was 154 (85-193). Children seen at the CH were younger (mean 10.2 &plusmn; 4.0 vs 12.2 &plusmn; 3.9, p&lt;0.01), more likely non-white Hispanic (68% vs 46%, p&lt;0.01), and publically insured (58% vs 49%, p=0.04). CH patients underwent significantly fewer CT scans (23% vs 70%, p&lt;0.01) and more US (75% vs 20%, p&lt;0.01). For all patients, on multivariate regression, increased preoperative CT use was significantly associated with NCHs (OR 7.5, 95%CI 5.3-10.6), older age (age &gt;10: OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.8-2.9), and female gender (OR 1.34, 95%CI 1.05-1.71). For patients triaged at NCHs, older age (age &gt;10: OR 2.4, 95%CI 1.8-3.1) and female gender (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.02-1.73) remained significantly associated with CT use. No patient characteristics were associated with increased CT use at CH. Children presenting at CH were more likely to undergo US (OR 11.8, 95%CI 8.3-16.9). Younger age (age &le; 10: OR 1.9, 95%CI 1.5-2.5) and female gender (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.1-1.9) were predictive of US use overall.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Within our hospital system, there are significant differences in utilization of imaging modalities for suspected pediatric appendicitis between CH and NCHs.

About 10-13% of premature babies will have an inguinal hernia diagnosed, and the timing of repair of these is controversial, as the data balancing risks of general anesthesia vs. incarceration are not clear. The purpose of this study was to understand outcomes from inguinal hernia repair in premature babies performed before or after discharge from the NICU.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective analysis was performed on all babies who had inguinal hernia repair performed at a single institution over a 5 year period. Babies with a gestational age at birth less than 35 weeks were included in this analysis and data regarding clinical course, surgery, and postoperative course were collected and analyzed. Primary outcomes of incarceration and anesthesia related complications were chosen. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 226 premature babies had inguinal hernia repair, with a 3.3:1 male preponderance, mean birth weight of 1.24 kg, and mean gestational age of 29.3 weeks. The cohort was stratified by timing of repair into before or after NICU discharge. Those repaired before discharge were significantly smaller, had more comorbidities, repaired earlier, longer postoperative hospital stay, and higher rates of delayed extubation. Complication rates, use of laparoscopy, gender, and race were similar, but operative times tended to be longer in the group before discharge (table). More babies were on oxygen at the time of surgery in the NICU group. Incarceration rates were similar, and none required a bowel resection. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While there was no difference in recurrence, complications or incarceration rates whether surgery was performed before or after discharge, the operations tended to take longer and there were more respiratory issues in those repaired in the NICU. Despite the retrospective nature of these data, it suggests that delayed repair in selected neonates may be warranted.

Patient data, including demographics, CVAD type (subcutaneous port or tunneled catheter), complications, and patient outcomes were collected. Peri-operative complications (&le;24 hours of surgery) include pneumothorax, hematoma, hemothorax, arterial puncture, and catheter malposition. Long-term complications (&gt;24 hours after surgery) include deep venous thrombosis (DVT), line-associated infection (blood stream and/or port site infection), and line malfunction (kinks, leaks, breaks).

Over 70% of lines had at least one long-term complication (thrombosis, catheter-related blood stream infection, or unexplained line malfunction). Seventy-five lines were removed prematurely: 31 due to infection, 36 due to malfunction, and 8 due to malposition. Obesity (OR 6.9, 95% CI 1.62-29.43), pre-operative dosage of packed red blood cells (OR 3.13 , 1.07-9.21), blood stream infection (OR 5.75, 1.69-19.56) were associated with increased risk of premature catheter removal; unexplained malfunction was associated with a lower risk (OR 0.28, 0.09-0.93).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While the rate of peri-operative complications is low, our observed long-term complication rate was higher than expected. Obesity, the preoperative dosage of packed red blood cells, presence of a blood stream infection, and unexplained line malfunction are significant predictors of premature CVAD removal in a pediatric leukemia population. Patients with these characteristics may represent a subset population that warrant closer CVAD surveillance and may benefit from additional prophylatic thrombolytic therapy.

Delays in care increase the chance that a patient will undergo orchiectomy rather than orchidopexy. Interhospital transfers represent a potential delay in care, and the patient and hospital level factors influencing the decision to transfer remain unclear. This population-based study aimed to determine patient and institutional factors associated with transfer for pediatric testicular torsion.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This retrospective cross-sectional study utilized the National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) from 2006 to 2012. Encounters by males aged 1 to 21 years with one of the diagnosis codes for testicular torsion (608.2, 608.20, 608.21, or 608.22) were included.

Associations of interhospital transfer with patient and institutional characteristics were evaluated using Rao-Scott chi square tests then multivariable logistic regression.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During 2006 to 2012, there were 11,435 ED visits for testicular torsion by males aged 1-21 years who were either admitted or transferred to another hospital. In multivariable logistic regression, we found that the probability of transfer decreased significantly with increasing age (Figure) and was lower for patients living in zip codes in the highest income quartile (OR=0.69, p=0.003), or who had  any listed comorbidity (OR=0.55, p&lt;0.001). Patients were less likely to be transferred at hospitals in the Northeast region of the United States (OR=0.28 compared to the Midwest, p&lt;0.001), at urban hospitals (OR=0.31, p&lt;0.001), at teaching institutions (OR=0.55, p&lt;0.001), and at level 1 or 2 trauma centers (OR=0.31, p&lt;0.001).

Patient demographics, drowning characteristics, level of trauma activation, transfer, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and body temperature at arrival, cervical spine and head imaging, admission and discharge details, mortality, need for surgical intervention in first 24 hours, and other associated injuries were recorded. Univariate analysis using chi-square or Fisher exact test for nominal variables and student t-test for continuous variables was performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:104 patients, with a median age of 4.0 years (range, 18 days to 17 years), met the inclusion criteria. 27 (26%) were female and 77 (74%) were male. The most frequent site of drowning was the pool (78.1%), followed by bathtub (14.4%), and natural water (6.7%). A witnessed fall or dive was reported in 35.6% patients, 39.4% patients did not fall or dive and 25% had an unwitnessed near-drowning event. Most (72.1%) patients did not undergo any cervical spine imaging. Brain/Head imaging was obtained in 33.7% patients. Notably, none of the patients, at either site, required any form of surgical intervention in the first 24 hours after presentation, other than placement of monitoring lines. Only 6.7% patients were admitted to the Pediatric Trauma Surgery service. The majority of patients (59.6%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, or to general pediatric floor (34.6%). A small proportion of patients (5.8%) were discharged home from the emergency department. Overall mortality was 17.3%. Factors associated with mortality included transfer from outside hospital (p=0.016), presence of hypothermia on arrival (p&lt;0.0001), GCS of 3 on arrival (p&lt;0.0001), or drowning in a pool compared to bathtub or freshwater (p=0.013).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The incidence of associated traumatic injury in drowning and near drowning patients is low. In this series, we did not find any traumatic injures requiring immediate surgical attention. Additionally, the majority of patients are admitted to non-surgical services for their inpatient management. These data suggest that routine Pediatric Trauma Surgery service involvement in patients with near-drowning accidents may be unnecessary.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Surgical resection remains the standard of care.  However, evidence-based recommendations for post-operative follow up are lacking.  In some centers, patients may receive no long term follow up; whereas at others institutions, long-term care for several years may be provided. Our aim was to review outcomes of patients that have undergone therapy for benign teratomas in an effort to generate a decision tree for the follow up of these patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: After IRB approval, the electronic medical records of patients at the Lurie Children&#39;s Hospital of Chicago (January 1st, 2005 to January 1st, 2015) were queried.  Patient age, sex, classification of teratoma, surgical procedure, alpha fetoprotein levels (AFP), pathology, follow up plan, follow up time, and recurrences were recorded.  Patients with the pathological diagnosis of sacrococcygeal teratoma were excluded. Statistical analysis was completed with Student's T-test and ANOVA using Graph Pad Prism 6 software.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We identified 73 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of a teratoma. Of these, there were 65 ovarian teratomas (4 immature, 61 mature), 5 mediastinal teratomas (all mature), and 3 retroperitoneal (1 immature, 2 mature). Ages ranged from 2 days to 21 years.  There was a significant difference in the initial AFP level between the groups. The immature teratomas had an average AFP of 2239.2 and the mature teratomas had an average AFP of 3.15 (p&lt;0.0004). There were no significant differences in follow-up time (p=0.895). There was one recurrence in the immature group and no recurrences in the mature group (p=0.0001). Overall, there was a 1.3% recurrence rate. The only recurrence was that of an immature ovarian teratoma with an initially elevated AFP of 1978. Post-operative AFP levels were not elevated, even during episodes of recurrence. We identified high variability in the recommended follow up (10 different strategies). Most commonly, an ultrasound and AFP every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for the next 2 years, and then yearly till 5 years postoperatively.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our data indicates that patients with a diagnosis of ovarian, mediastinal, or retroperitoneal teratoma are at a low risk of recurrence after complete surgical resection.  Our findings correlate with current literature in that immature teratomas may have an increased risk of recurrence as compared to the mature teratomas. Based on our review, patients with mature teratomas do not need to be followed past the initial post-operative period. However, surgeons may consider following patients with benign teratomas with immature elements, especially patients with elevated preoperative AFP, for at least one year post-operatively.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

A Cochrane review on this topic noted a lack of evidence and recommended further studies. The purpose of this report was to assess outcomes in infants who underwent a gastrostomy alone vs. gastrostomy plus fundoplication.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of all neonates and infants who had a gastrostomy placed at a single institution from 2009-2014 was conducted. Demographics, comorbidities, hospital course, procedure, and outcomes were recorded. The cohort was then divided into gastrostomy and gastrostomy plus fundoplication. Main outcome variable was need for further antireflux procedures.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 226 cases - 104 gastrostomy and 122 with fundoplication. The cohorts were similar in gender, gestational age, race, weight, median age, LOS, and proportion neurologically impaired. Preoperative diagnosis of reflux was significantly higher in the fundoplication cohort (22 vs. 87%). There was a trend to increased overall complications in the gastrostomy group (31 vs. 20%), including minor issues. Postoperative need for antireflux medications was significantly increased for gastrostomy patients compared to preoperative use (p=0.01). Readmission for respiratory issues or aspiration events was equivalent (Table). Post-op reflux requiring a fundoplication or GJ tube was noted in 21/104 gastrostomy cases (25%), and compared to the remaining gastrostomy patients (n=83), the incidence of neurologic impairment, type of feeds, and age at surgery, were similar.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There was a high rate of reflux in patients who had a gastrostomy alone with a significant number requiring a secondary antireflux procedure, despite the &lsquo;high-risk' patients undergoing a fundoplication already.

This study aimed to define morbidities and costs related to modern-day care for children with vascular anomalies.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We reviewed the 2003-2009 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) for pediatric patients (age &lt; 21 years) hospitalized with hemangiomas, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), or lymphatic malformations (LM) as a primary diagnosis. Patients were grouped by type of vascular anomaly. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, complications, and hospital charges were compared. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In total, 7,485 pediatric patients with vascular anomalies were identified. Within this cohort, frequently associated comorbidities included chronic anemia (4.0%), hypertension (2.4%), and coagulopathy (1.8%). They also had nontrivial rates of sepsis (4.6%) and cellulitis (1.4%) associated with hospital care. Notably, children with AVM had the highest rate of in-hospital mortality (1.0%, p &lt; 0.001). AVM also were associated with the highest median hospital charge ($38,574, p &lt; 0.001), more than twice the cost for hemangiomas or LM. AVM care also had the greatest increase in median hospital charge (38.8%) from 2003 to 2009 (Figure).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:We found a significant rate of morbidity in children with vascular anomalies, most often from blood loss and infection. The greater cost of AVM care may be related to the higher mortality rate as well as the complexity of procedures required to treat them. Cost-effective management of vascular anomalies should target prevention and early recognition of both chronic comorbidities and acute complications.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Thymectomy may eliminate the production of auto-antibodies, but its role among pediatric patients has never been defined by a prospective, randomized trial. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the complications and outcomes of thymectomy for JMG.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a computerized search of MEDLINE from January 2000 to March 2015, supplemented with manual searches. Using a priori criteria, we evaluated 118 studies. Case series with fewer than 10 thymectomies were excluded. Data extraction was performed by independent reviewers and included demographic characteristics, timing of thymectomy, serology data, severity of JMG, peri-operative complications, surgical pathology, study design, and potential confounders.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Twelve retrospective studies met inclusion criteria. Of 653 total participants with JMG, 400 (61%) underwent thymectomy. The majority of thymectomies were performed via transsternal approach (n=295, 69%). Median (or mean) time to thymectomy was less than one year in 4 (44%) of 9 studies that specified time to thymectomy. Pre-operatively, patients were primarily Osserman stage I (n=135, 45%), followed by stages II (n=99, 33%), III (n=47, 16%), and IV (n=21, 7%). Elevated anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies were found in 87% (n=65/75) of thymectomized patients tested. Surgical pathology most often showed thymic hyperplasia (n=283, 87%), followed by normal thymus (n=35, 11%), and thymoma (n=8, 2%). Mean post-operative follow-up ranged from 2 to 5 years. Post-operative complications were not well documented. Post-operative improvement in JMG severity was recorded in 89% (n=281/316), including 28% (n=90/316) patients with complete sustained remission. Twenty-four (8%) patients had unchanged symptom severity post-operatively and nine (3%) patients had worsening of symptoms post-operatively. Two patients died post-operatively. Comparisons of thymectomy to non-operative management were mixed. One study reported a trend toward higher remission rate with thymectomy (55% vs. 38%, p=0.06). A second reported similar incidences of complete remission with and without thymectomy. One study found no effect of anti-AChR antibody status on response to thymectomy. Outcomes specific to surgical pathology findings were limited. No study stratified outcome of thymectomy by severity of JMG or timing of thymectomy for JMG.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Existing data studying thymectomy for JMG is entirely retrospective and does not support a clear benefit toward decreasing severity of disease. Reported complications were rare. Overall, the included studies were limited by power and heterogeneity with respect to timing of surgery, serology, patient age, and severity of JMG. Prospective, randomized study of thymectomy for JMG is warranted.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

The purpose of the study was to explore this relationship in the post-operative setting using measures of resource utilization as surrogate markers for disease severity.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Intraoperative findings were collected prospectively from attending surgeons using a standardized survey at a single children's hospital from 2011 to 2014. Peritoneal contamination (defined as the presence of purulent fluid or fibrinous exudate) was categorized as 'localized' (confined to the right lower quadrant and pelvis) or 'extensive' (extending to the liver as a marker for uncontained perforation) in patients with perforated disease. Imaging utilization, postoperative length of stay (PLOS), hospital cost, and readmission rates were compared using chi-square statistics for proportions and the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous data.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Eighty-eight patients were identified with perforated disease, of which 38% (34/88) were found to have extensive peritoneal contamination. Groups were similar on the basis of age, weight, gender, race, insurance status, preoperative WBC count and maximum temperature. Patients with extensive peritoneal contamination had significantly higher rates of postoperative abdominal imaging (58.8% vs 27.7%, p&lt;0.01) and a 30% higher median hospital cost ($17,663[IQR $12,564-$23,697] vs $13,516[IQR $10,546-$16,686], p&lt;0.01, figure) compared to patients with localized contamination.

The incidence of obesity-related comorbidities in the pediatric population has also increased with a concomitant decrease in age of onset. Nonsurgical options do not result in significant or sustained weight loss in these children and thus bariatric surgery has become an increasingly utilized option. Bariatric surgery is known to be a safe and effective weight loss solution in morbidly obese adults, however, limited data exists regarding safety and efficacy for pediatric bariatric surgery outside of NIH-funded centers. We sought to assess the perioperative outcomes and safety of children and adolescents undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity at a free-standing children's hospital which is not part of the NIH consortium.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We retrospectively reviewed demographics, comorbidities, and 30-day complications for all patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy during a 5 year period from 2010-2015 at a single free-standing children's hospital that is not a member of the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) study.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 105 patients underwent 107 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy procedures (2 revisions). The mean age was 17.3 years (4.5-24.8). The male to female ratio was 1:3.6. The majority of the patients were Black (56.2%), followed by White (22.9%), and Hispanic (17.1%). The mean Body Mass Index was 51.0 m2/kg (37.4-86.8). The most common comorbidities included obstructive sleep apnea (61.3%), hypertension (14.2%), diabetes (11.3%), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (9.4%), and dyslipidemia (6.6%). Average length of stay (LOS) was 1.8 days (1-7). One patient was excluded from LOS as she was awaiting heart transplant and her LOS exceeded the 30-day outcome period. There were no deaths. Major complications occurred in 3 patients (2.9%) during their initial postoperative hospitalization requiring reoperation and in 1 patient (1.0%) after discharge before the 30th postoperative day.  The reoperations were for gastric leak, epigastric bleed, and splenic parenchymal laceration.  The fourth patient did not require reoperation but did require anticoagulation for pulmonary embolus and deep venous thrombosis. Minor complications were observed in 4 patients (3.8%).  These included one submucosal hematoma requiring 2 weeks of TPN and three patients with decreased oral intake secondary to edema which required readmission for intravenous fluid hydration and steroids.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>:Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a safe treatment option for morbidly obese children and adolescents and can be successfully performed at a non-NIH funded center.

Multiple attempts at reduction are sometimes required, however intussusceptions are successfully treated with therapeutic enemas in 75-90% of cases. We hypothesized that patients who transferred from outside community hospitals (OSH) to a large academic children's hospital with intussusception were more likely to require operative management for their intussusception than those who were directly admitted.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: After IRB approval the electronic medical record was queried for patients presenting to Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children&#39;s Hospital of Chicago with a diagnosis of intussusception (July 1st, 2009 - July 1st, 2014). Age, sex, symptom duration, radiologic management, and surgical care were recorded. Additionally, OSH and transfer reports were analyzed for those patients that presented as a transfer. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's T-test and ANOVA using Graph Pad Prism 6 Software.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:We identified 270 patients with intussusception confirmed radiographically with ultrasound or CT. Of these patients, 212 (78.5%) were successfully treated non-surgically, and 58 (21.5%) required surgical management.  Of the patients requiring surgery, there were 38 reductions (24 laparoscopic, 14 open) and 20 bowel resections (1 laparoscopic, 19 open).There were 120 (47.2%) transfers from OSH. Of those patients requiring surgery, 37 (63.8%) had presented as a transfer from an OSH. We found that transferred patients, requiring surgery, spent a mean 7.77 hours at the OSH compared to 4.03 hours for the transferred patients that did not require surgery (p=0.0188). There was no significant difference in transport time (p=0.44).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In conclusion, intussusception can be managed non-operatively 78.5% of the time based on our experience. We have identified the amount of time patients spend at hospitals without pediatric surgical capabilities as an independent risk factor necessitating surgical management of intussusception. These data suggest that patients with the diagnosis of intussusception who present to hospitals without pediatric radiology or pediatric surgery, should be transferred in an expedited fashion.  Furthermore, in the event of a failed enema reduction at an OSH the transport of the patient should not be delayed as this may result in a higher likelihood of surgical management.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Electrolytes are used as a marker of resuscitation of prior to general anesthesia induction.  Often multiple fluid boluses and electrolyte panels are needed, delaying operative intervention.   We have attempted to predict the amount of IV fluid boluses needed for electrolyte correction based on initial values.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A single center retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with HPS from 2008 through 2014 was performed.  Abnormal electrolytes were defined as Chloride &lt; 100 mmol/L, bicarbonate &ge; 30 mmol/L or potassium &gt; 5.2 or &lt; 3.1 mmol/L.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the study period 542 patients were identified with HPS.  Of the 505 that were analyzed 202 patients had electrolyte abnormalities requiring IV fluid resuscitation above maintenance, and 303 patients had normal electrolytes at time of diagnosis.  Weight on presentation was significantly lower in the patients with abnormal electrolytes (3.8 vs 4.1kg, p&lt;0.01). Length of stay was significantly longer in the patients with electrolyte abnormalities, 2.6 vs 1.9 days (p&lt;0.01).  Fluid given was higher over the entire hospital stay for patients with abnormal electrolytes (106 vs 91 ml/kg/d, p&lt;0.01). The number of electrolyte panels drawn was significantly higher in patients with initial electrolyte abnormalities, 2.8 vs 1.3 (p&lt;0.01).  Chloride was the most sensitive and specific indicator of the need for multiple saline boluses.  Using an ROC curve, parameters of initial Cl<sup>-</sup> &lt; 80 mmol/L and the need for 3 or more boluses AUC was 0.71.  Modifying the parameters to initial Cl<sup>-</sup> &le; 97mml/L and 2 boluses AUC was 0.65.

This study reveals high sensitivity and specificity of presenting chloride in determining the need for multiple boluses.  We recommend the administration of two 20ml/kg saline boluses  separated by an hour prior to re-checking labs in patients with initial Cl<sup>-</sup> value &le;97 mmol/L.  If the presenting Cl<sup>-</sup> &lt; 85 three boluses of 20ml/kg of saline separated by an hour are recommended.

The possibility of missing an alternative or co-incidental diagnosis such as carcinoid tumor in the non-operative management of appendicitis merits knowing the actual risks of nonoperative management.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  An IRB-approved (062012-049) retrospective review of pediatric patients (n=6816) who underwent appendectomies at an independent children's hospital over an 11 year period from January 2000 to December 2010 was performed.

In 224 subjects (3.4%), diagnoses other than appendicitis were identified: non-inflammatory obstruction (n=71), other infectious etiologies (n=58), non-specific inflammatory changes (n=58), extra-appendiceal pathology (n=31), tumors (n=4), and foreign body (n=2). Additionally, 6 patients with true appendicitis had co-existing carcinoid tumors. 325 specimens (5.0%) were documented as negative appendicitis. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the largest analysis of the incidence of pathologies that masquerade as appendicitis in the pediatric population conveying a broad overlap of diagnoses that present similarly or coincidently. Given the common diagnosis of appendicitis, follow-up for routine appendectomies has been streamlined and expedited in such a way that review of pathology may be overlooked; the number of infectious etiologies and tumors detected reinforces the increasing importance of pathology review in post-operative follow-up to appropriately diagnose uncommon conditions that may necessitate further work-up and treatment.  Incidence of carcinoids and infections was low but will need to be considered in nonoperative management with persistence of symptoms or in follow up.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

No differences between levobupivacaine and bupivacaine are observed in regards to the efficacy of the blocks (p = 0.570), time to first micturition (p = 0.196), duration of prolonged motor blockade (p = 0.098), and risk of vomiting (p = 0.825).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  CB and PB offer equivalent anesthetic outcomes in pediatric patients' age 16 months to 18 years undergoing circumcision.  CB is associated with a longer time to urination and ambulation.  Additional adequately powered studies are needed to further investigate optimal medication dose and anesthetic choice.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Literature regarding ultrasound guided CVC placement in children remains limited and conflicting. This meta-analysis examines the impact of ultrasound guided CVC placement among pediatric patients in regards to success rate, number of attempts required, incidence of accidental carotid artery puncture, and time to cannulation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A comprehensive literature search of all published randomized control trials (RCTs) assessing the use of real-time ultrasound guided CVC insertion in pediatric patients &lt;18 years of age was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar (1966-2015). Keywords searched included 'ultrasound guided' and 'central venous catheter'. Studies comparing the use of real-time ultrasound CVC insertion with anatomic landmark CVC placement in pediatric patients &lt;18 years of age were included. Primary outcomes analyzed were cannulation success rate, number of attempts required, incidence of carotid artery puncture, and time to cannulation.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 8 RCTs involving 760 patients (367 via ultrasound guidance and 393 via anatomic landmark placement) were analyzed. Ultrasound guided CVC insertion significantly increased success rates by 31.8% (Relative Risk (RR) = 1.318; 95% CI, 1.101 &ndash; 1.576; p=0.003) and decreased the mean number of attempts required (Mean Difference (MD) = -1.261; 95% CI, -1.711 to -0.812; p&lt;0.001). A trend towards a decrease in the risk of accidental carotid artery puncture with the use of ultrasound guided CVC insertion was also observed (RR = 0.359; 95% CI, 0.118 &ndash; 1.093; p=0.071). Ultrasound guided CVC insertion was not associated with a significantly longer time to CVC placement (MD = 1.175 = -0.287 to 2.636; p=0.115).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Ultrasound guided CVC placement is associated with significantly higher success rates and decreased mean number of attempts required for cannulation. There is also a trend towards a decrease in accidental carotid artery puncture, which was not statistically significant likely due to inadequate sample size. Ultrasound guided CVC insertion improves success rates, efficacy, and safety among pediatric patients. Additional studies are required to determine the efficacy and safety of ultrasound guided CVC insertion in specific age populations of neonates compared to older children, and in the various healthcare settings.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

The aim of this study was to compare the head ultrasound (US) and MRI of these patients and correlate neuroimaging findings to neurodevelopmental outcome.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective review of all patients treated at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital between 2006-2015 with a diagnosis of CDH who required ECMO. Patients were included if they had a head US and MRI in the neonatal period. Baseline patient characteristics, hospital course, and survival data were collected.  Neurodevelopmental impairments were classified as 0=normal, 1=mild, 2=moderate, or 3=severe based on Peabody scores and clinical records from a multidisciplinary CDH clinic. MRIs were graded based on severity of abnormality as 0=no abnormality, 1=mild (ventricular dilation or small extra-axial hemorrhages), 2=moderate (large parenchymal hemorrhage or combination of mild hemmorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic abnormalities), or 3=severe lesions (multiple large parenchymal hemorrhage, diffuse atrophy, diffuse leukomalacia). Spearman's rho was used to calculate a correlation coefficient between neurodevelopmental impairments and MRI grades.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 64 patients with a diagnosis of CDH that required ECMO. 22 of these patients had both head US and MRI evaluation. The overall survival of this cohort was 77%. The defect was left-sided in 77%. The mean length of stay was 99&plusmn;60 days, and the mean ventilator-free days in 60 days of life was 16&plusmn;17. The mean duration on ECMO was 15&plusmn;7 days. Median follow up among survivors (17/22) was 1,038 days (IQR 196-1,665). US did not demonstrate acute bleeding in any patients, but did identify dilated ventricles and prominence of extra-axial spaces in 14%. MRI of these patients also did not show significant bleeding, but found 2/22 (9%) with no abnormality, 7/22 (32%) with mild lesions, 3/22 (14%) with moderate lesions, and 10/22 (45%) with severe lesions. Neurodevelopmental impairment was mild in 6/17 children (35%), moderate in 3/17 (18%), severe in 5/17 (29%), and absent in 3/17 (18%).  Spearman's rho correlation coefficient between neurodevelopment impairments and MRI grades was 0.55 (Figure).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study suggests that brain MRI and US correlate in the detection of major findings such as bleeding, however MRI is more accurate than US in detecting subtle changes such as volume loss in CDH patients that required ECMO. Correlation between MRI and neurodevelopmental outcomes was weak. These data suggest the importance of close surveillance for neurodevelopmental outcome regardless of early MRI findings.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Treatment includes the Ladd procedure to correct intestinal malrotation for symptomatic patients. However, debate remains regarding the timing of the procedure for asymptomatic infants with known malrotation. We hypothesized that the benefits of prophylactic Ladd procedure outweigh the risks of post-symptomatic repair.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients undergoing the Ladd procedure was performed. Prophylactic Ladd procedures were identified as those that occurred prior to any malrotation-related symptoms (i.e. abdominal pain, distention, nausea, emesis, constipation, or feeding intolerance). Results were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U and chi-squared tests.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 2011-2014, 42 patients (prophylactic=19, post-symptomatic=23) underwent the Ladd procedure for intestinal malrotation. The median (interquartile range) age of patients was 9.6 (3.9-18) months and 18 (2.4-52) months for prophylactic and post-symptomatic patients, respectively (p=0.38). In patients who underwent post-symptomatic Ladd procedures, 9 (39%) were found to have volvulus and 1 (4.3%) had bowel necrosis at time of surgery. No prophylactic Ladd procedure patients required reoperation while 6 (26%) post-symptomatic patients required reoperation for gastrointestinal-related complications (p=0.02). Prophylactic versus post-symptomatic Ladd procedure patients required a median (interquartile range) of 5.0 (3.3-6.8) days vs 7.4 (5.0-11) days to tolerate full enteral feeds (p=0.11) and 8.0 (6.1-11) days vs 11 (7.5-32) days until discharge (p=0.09).

Although several studies address the uses and outcomes of ECLS, no studies have specifically evaluated the impact the time of cannulation has on clinical outcomes.  We sought to compare the incidence of complications based on timing of cannulation during the work day.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A retrospective review was conducted in patients less than 18 years of age who were placed on ECLS at a pediatric tertiary care center between May 2004 and May 2015 by the pediatric general surgery service.  Data analyzed included gender, age at cannulation, timing of cannulation and decannulation, total duration of ECLS, diagnosis, complication and survival to discharge.   Patients placed on ECLS during the work day were compared to those placed on ECLS after hours using 2-tailed Student t-tests and Pearson chi-square.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  There were a total of 176 patients placed on ECLS.  The most common indications for cannulation were congenital diaphragmatic hernia (n=58), primary pulmonary hypertension (n=41), meconium aspiration (n=19), and respiratory failure (n=18).  There was a male predominance (61%), and the median age of cannulation was 2 days (0, 5526 days).  One hundred sixty two patients underwent preoperative echocardiogram; 83% of these had cardiac dysfunction, most often pulmonary hypertension.  Forty one (23%) patients were placed on ECLS between the hours of 12 AM to 7:59 AM, 56 (32%) patients between 8AM and 3:59 PM, and 79 (49%) patients between 4 PM and 11:59PM (p &lt; 0.01).  When comparing scheduled operative hours (8 AM-3:59 PM) versus off hours (4PM-7:59AM), there was no statistically significant difference in total complications, central nervous system derangement, mortality on ECLS, hemorrhage (non intracranial source),  or cannula repositioning (Table).  Conversion from venovenous to venoarterial bypass (1.8% versus 3.4%, p=0.35) and survival to discharge (62.5% versus 60.0%, p=0.75) were also similar.

Chang<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital,General Surgery,Boston, MA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Small bowel volvulus in children is a devastating condition that most commonly occurs in patients with congenital malrotation.  Failure of normal rotation and fixation of the intestine leads to a narrowed mesenteric root, which predisposes these patients to midgut torsion. The resultant bowel ischemia and obstruction require expedited surgical management to avoid the serious consequences of short gut syndrome, sepsis and death.  Small bowel volvulus predominately affects the pediatric population with up to 80% of patients affected within the first month of life and 90% within the first year. Current clinical knowledge of this disease is based mainly on analyses of single institution experiences or case studies. Using a national database inquiry, we aim to characterize the epidemiology and outcomes of this disease at the population-level and to define predictors of mortality.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database, was retrospectively reviewed for patients 18 years old or less with small bowel volvulus (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition [ICD-9] code 560.2 excluding gastric/colonic procedures) from 1998 to 2010. Bivariate analysis was performed to define the demography of patients with small bowel volvulus. Baseline characteristics of patients who required small bowel resection were compared using bivariate statistical tests (Fisher Exact and Student's T-tests). Predictors of mortality were modeled using logistic regression.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 2422 hospitalizations for small bowel volvulus, and of these, 1751 (72.3%) required surgical intervention. Small bowel volvulus occurred more frequently in male (61.3%) than female (38.7%, ratio 1.6 to 1) patients.  Most cases presented emergently (86.1%), and the majority of patients were treated at urban (91.3%) and teaching hospitals (72.3%). The overall mortality rate was 3.1%. Mean age was 7.2 years (SD 6.4 years), and this average was unchanged when the cohort was restricted to only those patients with volvulus as their primary diagnosis. Patients who required small bowel resection were more likely to present with shock (50% vs. 19.5%, p&lt;.0001) or peritonitis (46.9% vs. 19.6%, p&lt; .0001), and more likely to be premature (20.3% vs. 33.3%, p&lt;.014).  On multivariate regression, predictors of mortality identified included vascular insufficiency (incidence 18.5%, OR 30.5, 95% C.I. 10.3 - 90.1, p&lt;0.001) and shock (incidence 3.7%, OR 8.8, 95% C.I. 2.6 -29.3, p&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This epidemiological study demonstrates an analysis of the trends of small bowel volvulus in a pediatric populace that accurately represents the national population. Male predominance of this disease is confirmed and a real world mortality rate of 3.1% is defined. Mean age for this cohort is higher than has been described previously. Vascular insufficiency and shock were strong predictors of mortality, and should be incorporated in future clinical nomograms and risk-calculators.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

However, benefits of clinical guideline implementation for surgical procedures and post-operative care in the pediatric population have not yet been well documented. One area of patient care with significant variability in physician practice is the postoperative management of infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We established clinical practice guidelines for the postoperative care of patients with pyloric stenosis as agreed upon by faculty consensus. A retrospective chart review was designed to evaluate the effects of the implementation of the guidelines. All infants diagnosed with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis at our two major referral children's hospitals from October 2012 to March 2013 were included in the control group. We allowed for a 6 month period for implementation of the protocol.  Those diagnosed with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis from September 2014 to February 2015 were included in the protocol study group. Exclusion criteria for both groups included significant co-morbidities. Charts were reviewed for compliance to the protocol, post-operative complications (as defined by NSQIP), re-admission rates, and length of post-operative hospital stay. The two study groups were then compared using standard statistical analysis, including student t-test to compare the mean length of hospital stay between the control and protocol groups.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 41 patients eligible for the study.

However, how the HI may be affected by growth of the chest wall over time is unknown. Understanding this effect would be valuable in determining if the HI is a useful and objective measure of correction in pectus excavatum; specifically, patients undergoing investigational techniques for repair such as magnetic correction which results in a more gradual change of the chest wall<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A single institution, retrospective chart review from 2004-2014 was conducted. Patients aged 0-18 years without known chest wall deformities that underwent at least 5 computed tomography (CT) scans were included to assess for changes in the anterior-posterior (AP) dimension, transverse dimension, and the HI.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Forty-four patients were identified. All patients had an oncologic diagnosis for which serial chest CT scans were obtained.  59 percent of the patients were male. The mean age at initial CT evaluation was 12 years (range: 4-16 years). The mean time between initial and 5th CT scan was 41 months (range: 7-80 months). Over that period, the mean change in height was 10 cm (range: 0-32 cm). Thirty two patients grew more than 5 cm during this time. The mean AP diameter changed at a different rate than the mean transverse diameter (0.9 versus 1.6 cm, p=0.005). This affected the HI over that time which differed by a mean of 0.2 (range: 0.0-0.8). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Based on serial CT imaging, the rate of growth of the AP diameter and the transverse diameter of the chest varies over time which can affect the HI by as much as 0.8. Therefore, other objective measures should be sought that may more effectively measure pectus excavatum severity for use in investigational trials.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

The purpose of this study was to understand the optimal management of a first episode of spontaneous pneumothorax. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective cohort at a single center over 12 years (2002-2014) was studied. Cases of PSP in the 5-19 year age group were selected and other pneumothoraces excluded. Data regarding pre, hospital, and post hospital course was collected and analyzed, with recurrent PSP the primary outcome variable. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 362 cases of pneumothorax in children were found, and 81 met the inclusion criteria for PSP. An overall recurrence rate of 44.4% was noted, with 89% within 12 months of the initial PSP. Recurrent PSP cases were older and taller, but were similar to the non recurrent ones in use of chest tubes, and in the proportion of initial CXR being moderate or larger pneumothorax. CT scan use was not significantly different between recurrent and non recurrent groups, and 5/6 CT scans read as &lsquo;normal' had recurrence. Thoracoscopic surgery resulted in a significantly lower rate of recurrent PSP (Table). Patients who did not undergo surgery had a 50% recurrence rate with 90% within 12 months of the initial PSP. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Recurrence after PSP in children and adolescents was high and a majority occurred within a year requiring readmission. A negative CT scan for subpleural blebs still had a high recurrence, while thoracoscopic blebectomy and pleurodeisis had significantly lower recurrence.

Neonatal and pediatric patients requiring extracorporeal life support (ECLS) represent a subset of critically ill patients whose nutritional delivery by enteral (EN) and parenteral (PN) routes has not been well characterized. Barriers to providing nutrition, particularly EN, exist although multiple studies document the feasibility and safety and current guidelines recommend EN for neonates on ECLS. This study describes nutritional delivery in neonatal and pediatric patients who received ECLS with a focus on NA and outcome.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A single-center, retrospective review of all neonatal and pediatric patients who underwent ECLS from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014 was performed. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data was abstracted. Daily energy and protein prescriptions and amount administered were recorded. NA for energy and protein was defined as the mean percentage of what was prescribed and defined as low (&lt;50%), moderate (50-80%), and high (&gt;80%). Patients whose duration of ECLS was &lt; 48 hours were excluded. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia patients were excluded from EN analysis. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: We identified 70 patients; 57.1% were male and median age was 4 months (IQR 72 months). 54 (77.1%) were initiated on venoarterial and 16 (22.9%) on venovenous ECLS. Overall survival was 62.9%. Mean ECLS duration was 220.1 hours; mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 20 days. Categories included: 12 (17.1%) neonatal respiratory, 14 (20.0%) pediatric respiratory, 16 (22.9%) neonatal cardiac, and 28 (40.0%) pediatric cardiac. 23 (32.9%) received nutrition prior to ECLS, but only 8 (11.4%) achieved goal EN prior to ECLS. Mean time to initiation of nutrition was 1.1 &plusmn; 1.3 days; mean time to initiation of EN was 4.2 &plusmn; 3.4 days. Mean time without any nutritional prescription was 1.4 &plusmn; 1.4 days; when nutrition was prescribed, mean energy NA was 92% of the daily goal for energy and 100% for protein. Energy NA, when prescribed, for neonatal respiratory, pediatric respiratory, neonatal cardiac, and pediatric cardiac was 89%, 88%, 95%, and 92%, respectively. However, EN only accounted for 24% of the NA goal. However, when all ECLS days are accounted for, including days without nutrition, only 27.1% achieve high NA.  There was no direct correlation with survival. Gastrointestinal complications occurred in 13.6% of survivors and 26.7% of non-survivors.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: NA in this neonatal and pediatric ECLS population is poor and utilization of enteral nutrition is low. When nutrition is prescribed, NA is met, but overall NA remains poor due to delayed onset and days without nutrition. Survival was not directly associated with NA as there are confounding variables, but improving NA may represent an opportunity to improve outcome in these critically ill patients.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

The primary outcome evaluated was the length hospitalization, and secondary outcomes evaluated included: time to extubation, age at return of bowel function, and time to tolerance of oral feeds.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This work was performed as a ten-year retrospective chart analysis including patients from 2005 to 2013. Inclusion in the study required a pre-operative diagnosis and a surgical intervention for gastroschisis. We identified 29 patients of interest who were filtered based on availability of the specific timing of each intervention. Chi-square test was used to determine statistical differences amongst categorical variables and the student t-test was used to determine differences amongst continuous variables.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The major factors influencing the Length of hospitalization were age at return of bowel function (p = 0.0213) and age at tolerance of oral feeds (p = 0.0116). Further early extubation was also correlated to a shorter hospital (p = 0.0003).  Analysis of mode of delivery, comparing vaginal delivery to Cesarean section, showed that patients delivered by Cesarean section had a reduced length of hospitalization as compared to those delivered vaginally (p = 0.0080). Mode of delivery did not significantly impact the other patient outcomes but we did find that time to oral feeds was increased in those patients undergoing unplanned deliveries (p = 0.0176).  No other outcomes were impacted by undergoing a planned versus unplanned gastroschisis delivery. Further, our results show a significant and positive correlation between birth weight and gestational age (p = 0.0164).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our data suggests that patients delivered without prior planning will have an extended time to tolerance of oral feeds. In addition, we find that patients delivered by Cesarean section will have shorter lengths of hospitalizations. Factors influencing length of stay after gastroschisis, such as return of bowel function and time to tolerance of oral feeds may be related to mode and timing of delivery. Many present studies focus solely on the impact of silo and primary closure in determining gastroschisis outcomes. We recommend that future analysis of larger databases should focus also on peri-partum factors that may influence outcomes in gastroschisis.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Visceral involvement, including sulphatide deposition in the gallbladder wall, is known to occur in MLD.  Our objective was to examine the incidence and outcomes of gallbladder abnormalities in children with MLD compared with children with similar LSDs, such as adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and Krabbe Disease.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a retrospective review of 24 consecutive children with MLD and 64 consecutive children with either ALD or Krabbe disease who underwent HSCT at our institution between 1994-2009.  Baseline characteristics and unadjusted outcomes were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and Pearson &chi;<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables, with significance defined as p &lt; 0.05.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In total, gallbladder abnormalities were present in 17 (71%) MLD patients compared with 17 (27%) ALD/Krabbe patients (p &lt; 0.001).  In the MLD group, these abnormalities included sludge (54%), wall thickening (38%), contracted gallbladder (42%), cholelithiasis (12%), and polyposis (8%).  Prior to HSCT, gallbladder abnormalities were found in 5 (21%) MLD patients and 2 (3%) ALD/Krabbe patients (p = 0.006).  After HSCT, an additional 12 (50%) MLD patients and 12 (19%) ALD/Krabbe patients developed gallbladder abnormalities (p = 0.008). Follow-up imaging was available for 14 of the 17 MLD patients who had gallbladder abnormalities. In 13 (93%) MLD patients with follow-up imaging, the gallbladder disease persisted or progressed.  Definitive management&mdash;laparoscopic cholecystectomy or percutaneous cholecystostomy&mdash;was ultimately recommended for 3 (13%) MLD patients and 1 (2%) ALD/Krabbe patients.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Children with MLD have a significantly greater incidence of gallbladder abnormalities than children with other LSDs, both prior to and after HSCT. Given these findings, children with MLD undergoing HSCT should receive gallbladder imaging pre-transplant and at regular intervals post-transplant. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be considered for persistent, symptomatic gallbladder abnormalities.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

The true incidence of malrotation outside of this age is difficult to estimate because the majority either have an atypical presentation or are asymptomatic, being recognized only intraoperatively during other procedures.  We sought to first determine the incidence, patterns of presenting symptoms, and what led to a final diagnosis of malrotation in patients over the age of one. We also analyzed anatomic intraoperative findings and its correlation with resolution of symptoms. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A retrospective review was conducted in patients older than one year of age who were treated for malrotation at a single pediatric tertiary care center between January 2000 and January 2015 by the pediatric general surgery service.  Data analyzed included age at presentation, presenting symptoms, radiographic imaging performed, surgical intervention, intraoperative findings and postoperative follow-up.  Patients predisposed to malrotation (situs inversus, gastroschisis, omphalocele and congenital diaphragmatic hernia) were excluded. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 246 patients were diagnosed with malrotation, of which 77 patients (31%) were found to be older than one year of age.  Out of this population, 25% were found incidentally during investigations for other disease processes.  The most common presenting symptoms were vomiting (68%), abdominal pain (57%), gastroesophageal reflux (18%), bilious vomiting (17%), constipation (17%) and failure to thrive (14%).  56% of patients had similar episodes of these symptoms in the past and 19% had chronic abdominal pain. The method leading to diagnosis included UGI (61%), CT (26%), intra-operative finding (6.5%) and other (6.5%) which included barium enema, esophagram, ultrasound, and CT angiogram. Sixty patients had an UGI during their workup, of which 83% were diagnostic for malrotation, 13% were 'suspicious for' malrotation and the remainder was non diagnostic. Out of these UGI's obtained, 27 commented on the position of the ligament of treitz, 11 were reported as a low lying ligament or low duodenojujunal junction.  Out of these 11 patients 10 were confirmed to have malrotation, with the 11<sup>th</sup> not receiving surgical exploration. Out of those patients radiologically diagnosed, 75 had surgical intervention with 97% confirmed to have malrotation.  Sixty percent were found to have a malrotated intestinal orientation, 33% with nonrotated, and 1% with reverse rotated orientation.  Twenty two percent were found to be obstructed with 12% having a volvulus.  Of the 68 patients with postoperative follow up, 59% reported alleviation of symptoms, 15% remained asymptomatic, and 26% had persistence of preoperative symptoms. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Malrotation should be on the differential list despite age given the highly variable clinical presentation.  An UGI should be conducted first for a prompt diagnosis and surgical correction should be undertaken despite atypical presenting symptoms.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

However, less is known about the reasons for readmission in children.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This was a retrospective review of pediatric patients (n=113,102) undergoing surgery (January 1, 2012 &ndash; December 31, 2013) at US hospitals enrolled in the Pediatric National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP-P). Patient characteristics and clinical data were abstracted from the NSQIP-P participant use data file and compared, stratified by the occurrence of an unplanned readmission related to the index procedure. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model factors associated with 30-day readmission. Reasons for readmission were reviewed to determine the most common causes of readmission across the represented surgical specialties.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: While the prevalence of unplanned readmissions was 4.2% (n=4,727), only 58.8% (n=2,781) of these readmissions, or 2.5% of children overall, were identified as readmitted within 30-days for a reason related to the index procedure.  Readmission was significantly associated with patient level factors such as comorbidities, as well as the urgency of the operation, and the occurrence of postoperative complications.  Overall, the most common causes for readmission were surgical site infections (SSI) (36.2%), ileus/obstruction or gastrointestinal etiologies (14.2%), and graft/implant/prosthesis-related complications (12.1%). The median time from discharge to readmission was 7 days (IQR: 3-13 days).  The most common causes for readmission and time until readmission varied between surgical specialties. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The reasons for readmission in children undergoing surgery are varied and influenced by multiple factors, such as patient characteristics, surgical specialty, and the occurrence of postoperative complications, particularly SSI. These data provide the opportunity for risk-stratification for readmission in pediatric surgical populations and help to identify potential areas for targeted interventions to improve quality in the care of children.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

Krishnaswami<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Oregon Health And Science University,Pediatric Surgery,Portland, OR, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Laparoscopic appendectomy has become the preferred management for acute appendicitis.  The use of a single laparoscopic umbilical incision (SPA), where the appendix is suture ligated in an extracorporeal manner similar to open appendectomy, has been proposed as a more cost effective alternative to 3-port appendectomy (3PA) which typically uses more ports and expensive surgical staplers.  However, there have been concerns surrounding postoperative outcomes between the two techniques.  We sought to review our experience with SPA and 3PA to identify any difference in clinical outcomes between the two techniques.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The charts of all children (ages 0-17) with a suspected diagnosis of acute appendicitis who underwent appendectomy at a tertiary pediatric referral center from January 2011-January 2014 were retrospectively reviewed.  The surgical technique (SPA vs 3PA) was identified, as were any infectious complications.  Data was analyzed using Chi square analysis to compare the outcomes in the two groups.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Three-hundred thirty seven patients underwent appendectomy (141 SPA and 197 3PA), 35.6% of whom (40 SPA, 80 3PA) had perforated appendicitis. Of patients with perforated appendicitis, 20.8% developed intra-abdominal abscesses (5 SPA, 20 3PA, p=0.15).  Eleven patients developed wound infections (4 SPA, 7 3PA, p=0.77). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:SPA does not result in increased infection rates for acute or perforated appendicitis and should be considered an equivalent technical alternative to 3PA in the surgical management of appendicitis.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Pediatrics"

ABG is necessary to achieve stability of maxillary segments and provide the necessary bony support for tooth eruption. Delays in ABG can adversely affect orthodontic treatment and overall outcomes.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We conducted a retrospective study of patients receiving ABG surgery at a large, urban cleft referral center. Patient charts were reviewed for demographic and clinical data. The primary outcome of interest was age at ABG. Race was defined as Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, or African American, with minority status given to Hispanic and African American. Insurance status was defined as public or private. Only non-syndromic patients with clefts involving the alveolus who received all cleft care at our institution were included in this study. A multivariate regression model was used to determine the impact of clinical and demographic variables on ABG timing. For purposes of comparison, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used with P values &lt;0.05 considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 233 patients underwent ABG surgery at 8.1 &plusmn; 2.3 years of age.

It has been shown in the past that the metallic component can cause radiation scatter, but it unclear if the effect of scatter is clinically observable in recurrence rates.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data was collected for patients with breast cancer treated with mastectomy and post-operative radiation over the time period of 2000-2008 from a community hospital and surgery center. CPT codes searched include 19303, 19304, 19307; which correlate respectively with simple, subcutaneous, and modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Chart review was undertaken to categorize data into four groups: (1) no expander used, (2) muscle flap reconstruction, (3) expander with IMP or integrated port, and (4) expander with EMP or remote port. All patients included had similar radiation dosing. Each patient's record was reviewed for findings of recurrence with follow-up minimum of 60 months. Chi-square test was used for comparisons. Inclusion criteria: modified radical mastectomy for local invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma, mastectomy with post-operative radiation, immediate breast reconstruction. Exclusionary criteria: re-operation for breast cancer, incompletion of radiation prescription or non-adherence to radiation prescription, those receiving radiation dosage of less than 50cGy, use of pre-operative radiation, mastectomy without radiation, tissue expander removal, exchange, or failure prior to completion of radiation therapy; other sources of en vivo attenuation; metastatic disease; inflammatory breast cancer; multifocal or bilateral breast cancer; less than 60 months of follow-up.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 102 cases that met inclusion criteria.

Descriptive statistics are reported in the form of mean &plusmn; standard deviation (SD), median (interquartile range, IQR), or counts (percentages) when applicable. Technical considerations to improve the reach of the PALT are described.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:21 patients (76% males) underwent PALT flap for  locoregional reconstruction. Mean duration of follow up was 20 months (range 0.4-64). Reconstruction after oncologic resection was the most common indication of PALT flap usage (n=13), followed by coverage of infected joints/prosthesis (n=8) and pressure ulcers (n=3). PALT was used for hip (n=5), groin (n=4), proximal thigh (n=3), trochanteric (n=3), lower abdomen (n=2), posterior thigh (n=2), ischial (n=1), and vaginal (n=1) reconstructions. In 28% of patients, the recipient site received pre-operative radiotherapy. A pattern of septocutaneous and musculocutaneous perforators existence in the same patients was observed in 3 patients only, the remaining 18 patients had an exclusive septocutaneous (n=9) or musculocutaneous (n=9) perforators vascular pattern. Musculo-fascio-cutaneous flaps were designed in 16 patients (4 of these were chimeric flaps), fascio-cutaneous flaps in 4 patients, and a cutaneous flap in one patient.  Technical considerations to improve the reach of the PALT to cover groin, lower abdominal, perineal defects are described, including passing the flap under the rectus femoris muscle, division of the Sartorius muscle, subcutaneous tunneling of the flap, and trans-femur tunneling. The rectus femoris branch of the descending circumflex femoral artery was divided in 7 patients after confirming rectus muscle viability via clamping the vessel for 20 minutes with no evidence of any muscle necrosis. We present an algorithm to improve the reach of the PALT for various anatomic locations (Table 1).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The PALT is a safe and reliable flap for locoregional reconstruction. Designing a flap with a distal skin paddle, Subcutaneous, submuscular and intermuscular tunneling and ligating the rectus branch are all technical details that help extend the reach of the PALT.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Plastics"

Additionally, there is a growing body of evidence showing equivalent oncologic outcomes between nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) and TM, with up to 10 years of follow-up. In contrast, oncologic and cosmetic outcomes of NSM and BCS have never been directly compared. Our study addresses this critical need by comparing NSM to BCS and TM. We hypothesize that there is no significant difference in recurrence, survival or cosmesis between these groups.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained, IRB approved (PRO12110356) database of all NSM performed at a single institution from 2009 to 2015. 116 patients undergoing NSM were compared to 115 undergoing BCS and 124 undergoing TM. 56% (n=67) of patients undergoing TM had reconstruction. Subjects were matched by age, tumor size and histology. Patients were excluded if they had metastatic cancer, severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, or if they were not eligible for BCS. The primary endpoint, locoregional recurrence rate, was defined as ipsilateral breast, chest wall or axillary recurrence within the follow-up period. Secondary endpoints included total (locoregional and distant) recurrence rate, overall survival rate and cosmetic outcome. Cosmetic outcome was determined using a 4 point Likert scale (excellent, good, fair, poor) by physician extenders as part of our yearly Wellness Clinic appointment or at post-operative visits. Outcomes were compared using Pearson Chi square test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Average (&plusmn; standard deviation) age was 48&plusmn;9 years. Tumor size was &lt;2cm for 82%, 2-5 cm for 15%, and &gt;5 cm for 3% of patients. Histology was invasive ductal cancer for 51%, invasive lobular cancer for 9% and ductal carcinoma in situ for 40% of patients. Follow-up was 15&plusmn;10, 27&plusmn;15 and 34&plusmn;21 months in the NSM, BCS and TM groups respectively. No significant difference was seen in locoregional recurrence rate between NSM (0.9%), BSC (0.8%), and TM (1.6%) or in total recurrence rate, NSM (7.8%), BCS (7.8%), and TM (5.6%) (p=0.7). Additionally, overall survival rates, (98.3%, 96.5% and 98.4%, p=0.6), were similar between NSM, BCS and TM, respectively.

Currently, however, the best resources for PSITE preparation are unknown.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Digital syllabi of 10 consecutive exams (2006-2015) were analyzed for recommended references. Each answer is accompanied by one or more references used to support the tested concept and direct interested readers for further reading. References were categorized as journal, textbook, or miscellaneous (webpages, package inserts, etc) and trends were noted over time. The most-referenced sources were noted by section (comprehensive, craniomaxillofacial, extremity, cosmetic). <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 2000 questions and 5385 recommended references were analyzed. The average number of references per question was 2.69 &plusmn; 1.02 (range = 0 &ndash; 11) with no differences among sections (p &gt; 0.05). Annual PSITE journal citations increased from 63.1% of all references in 2006 to 84.7% in 2015 (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.841). PSITE textbook references decreased from 36.5% in 2006 to 11.4% in 2015 (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.853). Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (PRS) comprised the plurality of journal references (38.5%) followed by Clinics in Plastic Surgery (5.6%), and Journal of Hand Surgery (American) (5.1%). PRS articles were used to support 47.0% of all PSITE questions and had highest yield in the cosmetic section (69.0%, p &lt; 0.05). Publication lag was shortest in the cosmetic (8.0 years) versus comprehensive (9.2 years) section (p = 0.003).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Plastic surgery faculty and residents may utilize these data to facilitate knowledge acquisition during residency. Residency curricula focused on recent PRS articles may afford an effective means for PSITE preparation.","Education","Resident Education","Cross Disciplinary"

Coffman<sup>1</sup>, T. R. Howdieshell<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of New Mexico HSC,Department Of Surgery,Albuquerque, NM, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Inability to close the abdominal wall after laparotomy for trauma may occur as a result of visceral edema, retroperitoneal hematoma, use of packing, and loss of tissue.  When direct fascial closure is not feasible at initial admission, skin grafting of visceral granulation tissue provides temporary cutaneous coverage.  Definitive abdominal wall reconstruction is planned when palpation yields graft separation from underlying viscera suggesting resolution of peritoneal inflammation.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Following laparotomy for trauma, patients with persistent visceral distension or abdominal wall tissue loss precluding fascial closure underwent index admission visceral split thickness skin grafting and readmission graft excision and reconstruction.  Real-time visceral skin graft perfusion and functional revascularization was determined by serial laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI).  Image analysis of CD-31 and &alpha;-SM actin immunostained histologic sections of harvested skin (nongrafted control) and excised visceral skin grafts was utilized to determine microvascular density and morphology.  Quantitative RT-PCR arrays were performed on nongrafted control skin and excised visceral grafts to analyze the expression of a focused panel of genes involved in tissue injury and repair.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Five patients (3 male, 2 female) ranging in age from 26 to 45 years (mean 36 years) underwent visceral skin grafting for cutaneous coverage of an open abdomen.  Time to graft excision ranged from 5 months to 1.5 years (mean 6.5 months).  LSCI documented mean perfusion of pre-graft visceral granulation tissue of 1100 PU (range 900-1200 PU), and immediate skin graft application perfusion of 150 PU (range 120-190 PU), primarily a result of background perfusion through meshed interstices.  By POD 5, skin graft perfusion doubled to a mean value of 300 PU, peaked at a mean of 350 PU by POD 14 concomitant with closure of meshed interstices, and remained unchanged until excision.  Histologic examination revealed a 5-fold increase in excised graft thickness (mean control 400 &micro;m vs. mean excised 2100 &micro;m).  Immunostaining documented a 2-fold increase in vessel number, a 3-fold increase in vascular surface area, and a dramatic increase in percentage of vessels covered by smooth muscle in excised grafts compared to control skin.  RT-PCR demonstrated statistically significant up-regulation of genes involved in matrix structure and remodeling, cytoskeleton regulation, and WNT signaling; and down-regulation of key inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our preliminary data documents early visceral skin graft revascularization with a plateau in perfusion over the study interval.  Histology reveals a marked increase in the mass of graft subdermal matrix composed of a complex supporting vascular network.  The excised graft transcriptome is rich in extracellular matrix remodeling enzyme gene activity which may be important in graft separation from peritoneal contents.","Basic Science","Wound Healing/Fibrosis","Plastics"

As ASCs are a significantly heterogenous cell population, identification of cell subpopulations with enhanced secretion of pro-angiogenic growth factors would facilitate their use in strategies to further improve fat graft take.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Human lipoaspirate was enzymatically digested in order to obtain SVF cells. Individual ASCs were isolated via flow cytometry based on an established surface marker profile. As we have previously described, single cell transcriptional profiling of select angiogenic and adipogenic genes, as well as multiple cell surface markers, was employed. Applying a Fuzzy C-Means algorithm to this data allowed for partitioning of ASCs into multiple, functionally distinct clusters. Linear discriminant analysis was then performed to correlate surface marker expression with cluster definition. We then utilized flow cytometry, a cell proliferation assay, qRT-PCR, and an in vitro endothelial tube formation assay, to evaluate CD248, the most promising of these markers, for the potential to isolate cells with enhanced angiogenic potential.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Using this strategy, we identified multiple markers with the potential capacity to delineate functional subgroups of ASCs based on angiogenic gene expression. Analysis of freshly harvested SVF cells by flow cytometry using CD248, the strongest correlating surface marker, showed 16% of cells were CD248<sup>+ </sup>and 84% were CD248<sup>-</sup>. Proliferation, gene analysis, and endothelial tube formation assays were performed, showing differences between CD248+, CD248-, and unsorted cell populations. qRT-PCR showed CD248+ cells to have significantly higher VEGFa secretion (**p&lt;0.01) compared to both unsorted and CD248- cells. CD248+ cells additionally were found to promote increased endothelial tube formation in vitro in comparison to unsorted and CD248- cells.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our methodology has identified multiple cell surface markers associated with ASC angiogenic capacity. The most highly correlated marker, CD248, characterizes a cell population with significantly enhanced angiogenic potential, suggesting that it may be used in in vivo applications for improvement of fat graft retention.","Basic Science","Wound Healing/Fibrosis","Plastics"

The aim of this study was to create a model of pharmacological delay that would induce vascular remodeling and decrease overall flap necrosis.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A modified caudally based McFarlane flap was created using a rat model.  Seven groups of random flaps were created (n=8) that included application of topical minoxidil and iloprost for various durations beginning 2 weeks prior to flap elevation.  A standard surgical delay group was performed for a positive control.  Surgical flaps were elevated, re-inset and observed at various time points until postoperative day 7.  Gross viability, histology, perfusion analysis, tissue oxygenation and vascular casting were performed for analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Pharmacologic delay with preoperative application of topical minoxidil and iloprost were found to have equivalent flap viability when compared to standard surgical delay.  A significant increase in viability was observed when comparing these groups to a negative control using a topical vehicle.   Pharmacologic delay was found to increase blood flow during the preoperative period through vascular remodeling rather than acute vasodilation.  These changes were not observed in flaps that were only treated in the postoperative period.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Preoperative topical application of vasodilatory agents, minoxidil and iloprost, yield equivalent viability in a random cutaneous flap model compared to the gold standard surgical delay.  We have created a model of non-invasive pharmacological delay that improves tissue viability and potential postoperative complications without an additional surgical procedure.","Basic Science","Wound Healing/Fibrosis","Plastics"

Although originally thought to be a purely soft tissue disorder, recent evidence suggests that orbital dysmorphism is also part of the disease. This includes a more lateral orbital wall, deeper orbits and flattened projections of the orbital rims. The lateral orbital wall is vertical, the orbit is deeper than normal and there is flattened projection of the orbital rims. The orbital volume can be less than normal and the supraorbital rim can be notched. The constellation of physical features are generally isolated to the periorbital region and may have some or all of the listed traits.The physical manifestations were originally described as the result of a mutation a transcription factor gene&mdash;FOXL2 -3q23. However, 105 mutations have been associated with BPES-like phenotypes. Here we investigate a novel, previously unreported pair of genes which result in BPES when mutated.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A male patient with BPES was identified along with the parent and siblings who had similar facial morphology. Physical features and anthropometric measurements were recorded. Whole blood samples were obtained and genomic DNA extracted.  Whole exome sequencing was performed and candidate mutations identified. Sanger sequencing was performed with appropriate primers to confirm. The entire coding region of the FOXL2 gene was resequenced via the Sanger method to confirm the absence of FOXl2 mutations.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Phenotypic features of this disease were found in 2 generations of living relatives (father, 2 male children and female child) As well as documented in the grandparents as well. The inheritance demonstrated a Mendelian autosomal dominant pattern with 100% penetrance. Genetic analysis confirmed that a conserved mutation was responsible for the progression of disease, while whole exome sequencing identified candidate genes ZC3H13, and RERE with a nonsense and missense mutation, respectively.We have identified a patient with orbitoblepharophimosis and, together with the father, the subjects were found to have a normal FOXL2 gene sequence, which was originally thought to manifest the disease. Whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing confirmed that FOXL2 was normal. The point mutation in ZC3H13 results in a premature stop codon of a gene which is known to be a strong transcription factor for FOXL2. Addition the single point mutation in RERE changes a cytosine for a thymine resulting in a proline to serine amino acid change.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:We have identified a missense and a nonsense mutation that together result in the BPES phenotype. Furthermore we have shown that FOXL2, a gene initially thought to be responsible for the mutation, to be completely normal in these patients.","Basic Science","Wound Healing/Fibrosis","Plastics"

There are times in which to achieve proper cytoreduction, abdominal wall resection is required.  These resections in part the need for abdominal wall reconstruction while some patients require reconstruction for other reasons as well. It is known that chemotherapy and hyperthermia in part increased risks for wound infections, poor wound healing and further complications. Therefore, we looked at the outcomes in our series of CRS-HIPEC patients taking a look at the outcoomes, morbidity and mortality of those patients requiring abdominal wall reconstruction compared to those who did not. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Demographics, comorbidities, intraoperative variables, and post-operative outcomes for all patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC at a single institution from 2012 to 2015 were analyzed.  Variables were examined with chi squared or Wilcoxon Ranked Sum Test where appropriate.  Survival was analyzed with Kaplan Meier curves and Cox Proportional Hazards Regression..<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:During this time frame, 27 individuals underwent CRS-HIPEC. There were 11 patients which underwent reconstruction, while 16 patients had no reconstruction. These patients were similarly aged and gender distribution.  They had similar epidural use and similar number of organs removed.  There was no difference in Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index for the two groups (22 vs 19 p=0.74). Patients undergoing reconstruction tended to have increased operative time (663min vs 489min p=0.01) as well as increased blood loss (1000ml vs 500ml p=0.02). Both groups had similar complication rate (72.7% vs 57.1% p=0.42).  Median follow up for the no reconstruction group was 4 months compared to 1.7 months for the reconstruction group.

Technology-based transitional care that allows digital image-based wound monitoring has the potential to detect and facilitate treatment of SSI at an early stage. We undertake a study to validate the use of smartphone digital photography to evaluate postoperative vascular surgery wounds. MethodsWe developed a wound assessment checklist using previously validated criteria. All patients 18 and older who underwent a vascular surgery procedure involving a surgical incision at least 3cm in size between May and December 2014 were recruited from a high-volume tertiary-care academic vascular surgery service. Vascular surgery attending surgeons, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses evaluated wounds using the assessment checklist in-person; a different group of providers evaluated the wound via a Smartphone digital photograph. Inter-rater reliability for (1) wound assessment and (2) treatment plan was measured using Gwet's Agreement Coefficient (AC) for the in-person group, the photograph group, and between groups. We used 1000 bootstrap samples with replacement to calculate 95% CI of Gwet's AC; the samples were drawn by wound. ResultsWe assessed 80 wounds (23 lower extremity wounds, 20 groin wounds, 18 abdominal wounds, 10 neck wounds, 5 upper extremity wounds, and 4 amputation stumps) in-person with a median 2 raters per wound (minimum of 1 rater and maximum of 4 raters), and via photograph with 9 raters per wound. Agreement between in-person and image-based assessments was high with respect to course of treatment with substantial agreement for antibiotics (AC=0.76) and need for debridement (AC=0.89). Relative to in-person raters, raters evaluating high-quality images were more likely to detect redness (OR=2.23, p&lt;0.001), drainage (OR=2.1, p&lt;0.01), and indicate the need for an ED visit (OR=6.42, p&lt;0.001). Raters evaluating low-quality images were more likely to indicate the need for an ED visit (OR=5.69, p&lt;0.001), but less likely to detect drainage (OR 0.13, p=0.005), than in-person raters. Less experienced clinicians were more likely to indicate the presence of ecchymosis (OR=1.47, p=0.03), more likely to indicate a need for wound drainage (OR=1.89, p=0.03), and less likely to suggest surgical debridement (OR=0.51, p=0.03). ConclusionsSmartphone digital photography is a valid method for evaluating postoperative vascular surgery wounds that is comparable to in-person evaluation across most domains of wound abnormality. The inter-rater reliability for determining treatment recommendations was universally high. Remote wound monitoring and assessment may play an integral role in future transitional care models to decrease readmission for SSI in vascular surgery patients.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Alkaline burns, which penetrate deeper and faster into the cornea, are the most severe form of chemical burn, and are associated with significantly poorer outcomes than acid burns. Currently, there are no large-scale epidemiologic studies that describe the incidence and burden of alkaline ocular burns in the United States. We sought identify and characterize trends, incidence, and characteristics related to patients presenting to Emergency Departments (EDs) in the US from 2006-2012 with alkaline ocular burns. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Using the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), we identified all patients who presented with an ICD-9-CM diagnosis of alkaline ocular burn from 2006-2012. We examined burden and trends related to age and sex to determine which populations were at highest risk of alkaline ocular burn injury. Age-specific population-based rates were calculated using the US Census Bureau's intercensal and postcensal estimates. Chi square tests were used to compare subsets across time and between age and sex groupings. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Patient age at ED presentation for treatment of alkaline ocular burns followed a bimodal distribution, with the highest population-based injury rates occurring among 1-year old infants (1.29 per 100,000), with a lower rate among two-year-olds (0.811 per 100,000). The second-highest injury-rates were found among adults in their twenties (e.g., 1.28 per 100,000 among 28-year olds). Overall, 55.2% of alkaline burn injuries occur among 20-45 year olds, and among this group, 67.9% of patients were male. Mean patient age at presentation was 35.5 years (95% CI: 34.7-36.3), and did not vary by sex (p=0.991). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Alkaline ocular burns are among the most critical and severe forms of ocular injury. Earlier studies and reviews in the literature identified working-age men as a high-risk cohort; however, we discovered that the single highest-risk age-based rate of ED presentation with alkaline ocular burns is found among one-year-old children. These findings may be used to aid in the design and implementation of appropriate prevention efforts, which may range from appropriate storage of chemicals in the home to policies on protective eyewear in the workplace.  Special attention must be paid to preventing access to alkaline agents among the youngest of children and educating parents on the need for rapid appropriate response when alkaline ocular burn is suspected in an infant.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

The development of post-operative AF is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. There are no well established guidelines for treatment of NCPO surgical patients who develop AF with RVR. The objective of this study was to evaluate the practice patterns for evaluation and treatment for NCPO surgical patients diagnosed with new onset AF with RVR in the surgical ICU (SICU). <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All adult patients (&ge; 18 years) admitted to the SICU from June 2014-June 2015 were retrospectively screened for the development of new onset AF with RVR (HR &gt;100). AF with RVR was confirmed by cardiologist reviewed EKG. Patient medical records were reviewed for demographics, hospital course, evaluation and treatment of AF with RVR, and outcome (cardiology consult, rate and rhythm (R/R) control within 48 hours, and in-hospital mortality). Data are presented as mean&plusmn;SD with statistical comparisons performed with student's t-test or Fisher exact test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 1070 patients admitted to the SICU during the study period. Fifty-seven patients developed AF with RVR, 33 of whom were new-onset AF with RVR (3.1%). For these 33 patients, the average age was 71&plusmn;11 with 19 males (58%). Cardiology consult was obtained for 18 patients (55%). Twenty-six patients (79%) had R/R control within 48 hours of AF with RVR onset. Seven patients died while hospitalized (21%) with 8 discharged patients (31%) readmitted within 30 days. &beta;-blockers were the most commonly used initial medication (67%). When used first, &beta;-blockers were successful at R/R control in only 27% of patients (6/22). Amiodarone had the highest rate of success if used initially (5/6, 83%), and if used as a second treatment (11/13, 85%). Cardiology consult was not associated with improved mortality (28% vs. 13%; p=0.41) or success with R/R control within 48 hours (61% vs. 100%; p=0.009). Failure to control R/R was associated with a greater number of cardiac comorbidities (100% vs 57%; p=0.06), increased BMI (31.8&plusmn;3.6 vs 26.1&plusmn;4.4; p=0.006), and less volume overload (3260&plusmn;2484 mL vs. 6630&plusmn;4131 mL; p=0.06).  In-hospital mortality was associated with being a trauma/acute care surgery patient (71% vs 15%; p=0.009), need for vasopressors at AF onset (71% vs. 27%; p=0.07), and higher SAPS II score (40.7&plusmn;9.5 vs. 29.7&plusmn;12.2; p=0.04). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: New onset AF with RVR was an uncommon development in the SICU but was associated with a high mortality. Treatment with amiodarone, rather than traditional &beta;-blocker, was associated with R/R control.  Failure to establish R/R control was associated with cardiac comorbidities, but not volume overload. These results will help to form our future algorithm for the treatment of AF with RVR in the SICU and will be prospectively studied.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Because many patients require initial stabilization followed by transfer to a higher level of care, administration of VTE prophylaxis may often be delayed. It is unclear if these patients are actually at increased risk for VTE. As VTE has become a quality metric for trauma centers, it is important to know if there is an actual increased risk for patients transferred.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The National Trauma Database (NTDB) v6.2 (2007-2012) was used to identify patients admitted to Level I and II trauma centers.  Patients receiving anticoagulants, &lt;18 years, or pregnant were excluded.  Patients transferred &lt;24 hours were compared to non-transferred patients with respect to age, sex, race, patient-level risk factors for VTE, and VTE rates. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and VTE. All calculations were done with SAS 9.3 SURVEYLOGISTIC and SURVEYFREQ procedures to include NTDB weights, strata and clustering to create nationally representative estimates. Alpha was set on P= 0.05. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 736,374 trauma patients identified for analysis during with 189,166 (25.7%) patients transferred to a level I or II trauma center within 24 hours of injury. A total of 11,619 (1.5%) developed VTE including 9,149 (78.8%) with DVT and 3,167 (21.2%) with PE.  The VTE rate was significantly higher in the transferred group compared to the non-transferred group (1.73% vs. 1.42%, p=0.002).  Significant differences exist with respect to DVT (1.39% vs. 1.14%, p=0.004) and PE (0.45% vs. 0.37%, p=0.003) between transferred and non-transferred patients respectively.  Multivariable analyses adjusting for patient-level risk factors demonstrated that transferred patients were independently associated with a higher likelihood of VTE (OR 1.15; 95% CI: 1.06 &ndash; 1.25, P=0.001 ), PE (OR 1.18; 95% CI: 1.08 &ndash; 1.30, p&lt;0.001), and DVT  (OR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.04 &ndash; 1.25, p=0.007).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Adult trauma patients transferred to a level I or II center that initially presented to another facility are at increased risk for VTE. Further studies are necessary to determine the causes for this increased risk.  Accepting a transferred trauma patient results in an increased VTE risk and may not be reflective of the quality of trauma care at the receiving facility.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

A factor that may affect patients' ability to address all their healthcare needs following a TSCI, particularly the potential life-long need for neuro-rehabilitation to improve neurological and functional outcomes, is their insurance status. We sought to describe time to insurance loss after TSCI in a population with employer-sponsored insurance.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We used the 2010-2012 Truven Health Systems MarketScan&reg; database which includes approximately 45 million patients under the age of 65 years who are covered through an employer-sponsored insurance plan. All hospitalized patients with a primary diagnosis of TSCI or a secondary diagnosis of TSCI accompanied by a primary diagnosis of other major trauma were included in the sample. Patients were followed in the database until discontinuation of enrollment in a MarketScan-affiliated insurance plan or until December 31, 2012, and the duration of insurance coverage was calculated. Log-rank tests and univariable Cox proportional hazards regression were used to compare TSCI patients with the general population and to compare the time to coverage loss for patients with and without spinal fracture and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for age, sex, and injury beneficiary status (e.g., employee, spouse, or child).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 5,231 patients were hospitalized for a TSCI during the study period. Of these, 44.8% had a primary diagnosis of TSCI, 70.5% had an associated vertebral fracture, and 21.0% had a complete TSCI. Two-thirds of the patients (67.1%) were male and the median age was 41 years (IQR: 23-54). An estimated 43.8% of the population with TSCI lost their insurance before the end of the study period, compared to 33.9% in the general population (HR=1.18, p&lt;0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, the hazard ratio was 1.23 (95% CI: 1.17-1.29, p&lt;0.001). Among patients with a TSCI, there was no difference in the risk of insurance loss between those with and without a concomitant spinal fracture (HR=1.03, p=0.61), but there was a significant difference between those with and without a concomitant TBI (HR=1.17, p=0.026).  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Approximately 4 in 10 patients with TSCI lost their employer-sponsored health insurance during the study period, a proportion significantly higher than that seen in the general population. Further research is needed to identify modifiable factors that could mitigate the extent of, and rate of loss of insurance among patients with TSCI.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

In 2014, our university-based American College of Surgeons verified Level 1 trauma center developed a 'Trauma Activation Checklist' as a joint project between the Departments of Emergency Medicine and Surgery. The checklist included three sections: 'sign in' for introductions and preparation prior to patient arrival; 'EMS timeout' for attention to handoff by prehospital providers; and 'sign out' for planning imaging, consults, and patient disposition upon leaving the trauma bay. The checklist was posted prominently in each trauma bay and discussed during annual and monthly trauma team orientations. We sought to evaluate checklist use during the transition to new teams in July 2015.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  During July 2015, trained observers monitored arrivals and evaluations of a convenience sample of patients seen as Level 1 (severely injured) and Level 2 (moderately injured) trauma activations. For each patient, they recorded the level of activation, time of day, and use of each checklist component as 'checked' or 'not checked'. Failure to verbally acknowledge a checklist component led to its recording as 'not checked'. No personally identifying data regarding patients were recorded. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze use of the checklist.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our center evaluated 130 patients via trauma activation in July 2015. 46 evaluations (35%) were observed for checklist adherence, divided between daytime (7am-5pm, 16 patients, 35%), evening (5-10pm, 23, 50%) and nighttime (10p-7a, 7, 15%). The least frequently completed section was the sign out; only 7 (15%) of the trauma activations completed this section in its entirety. All sections of the checklist were more commonly completed in Level 1 trauma activations than in Level 2 trauma activations (sign in: 41% vs 24%; EMS timeout: 65% vs 38%; sign out: 24% vs 14%).The most commonly missed individual components in the sign in section were placing pre-arrival orders and obtaining equipment access. In the EMS timeout section, obtaining referring institution records was most commonly missed, while assuring intensive care unit handoff was the component most overlooked in the sign out section.<br><br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Despite prominent incorporation into trauma team training and its highly visible position in the trauma bay, a trauma activation checklist is used suboptimally in organizing the arrival and initial evaluation of injured patients at our academic medical center. Teams are particularly deficient in completing the sign out section and verbalizing forthcoming plans for patient care, especially for patients deemed less critically injured. Improvements to the checklist itself and to checklist adherence and its effects on information exchange and patient care are ongoing.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

We sought to use the TPCR in conjunction with Trauma Registry data to examine which criteria were predictive of patient outcomes and resource use.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We conducted a retrospective study of adult TPCR cases matched with the County's regional Trauma Registry. All patients with a TPCR from 2003 to 2007 were eligible for inclusion. Outcomes included severe injury (Injury Severity Score &gt; 16), need for major OR procedure (MOR), and death. Univariate analysis of triage criteria vs. outcomes was shown as relative risks. Multivariate analysis was performed using stepwise logistic regression analysis. Predictors were included if they were significant at the 0.05 level. Stepwise receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also made using triage criteria as discrete (binary) predictors. At each step the sensitivity and specificity of each remaining criterion was calculated, and the criterion with the largest YI was accepted as the next predictor. This method was repeated until all remaining predictors had a YI of &lt; 5.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:17001 TPCR's were analyzed. The most common cause of injury was due to motor vehicle collision.  Nearly every trauma triage criterion was significantly associated with need for MOR, severe injury, and death.  GCS &lt;14 and flail chest were the most related to mortality (OR=12.4 CI 5.8-25.6; 11.4, 2.3-57.3 respectively).GCS &lt;14 and vehicle deformity were associated with every outcome and often the first criteria accepted into an outcome model. Mechanism criteria were included in 3 of the 6 outcome models.  Speed over 40 mph was a useful indicator for ISS&gt;15 or Major OR, but not death. The model with the highest sensitivity and specificity used mortality as the outcome (81% / 85%).

Pandya<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Grant Medical Center,Trauma Services,Columbus, OH, USA <sup>2</sup>The Ohio State University,College Of Medicine,Columbus, OH, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  Extubation failure and subsequent reintubation is associated with longer intensive care unit and hospital stay and worse outcomes when compared to successfully extubated patients.  For many institutions, a successful spontaneous breathing trial is the primary criteria to determine readiness for extubation.  Patients with traumatic injury, however, represent a unique population that requires special consideration.  It seems reasonable that injury types such as rib fractures and cervical fractures could influence success of extubation.  Relatively few studies on this topic have focused on the trauma patient population and their specific injury types.  The purpose of this investigation is to determine if specific types of traumatic injury predispose patients to extubation failure.  We hypothesize that rib fractures and cervical spine fractures are risk factors for failed extubation despite having a successful spontaneous breathing trial. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This study was a retrospective chart review of all trauma patients admitted to Grant Medical Center over a 6 year period from January 2009 to December 2014.  All injured patients on mechanical ventilation over the age of 15 were considered for the study.  Patients that were endotracheally intubated and subsequently passed a spontaneous breathing trial were included.  Exclusion criteria were self-extubation, tracheostomy placement prior to attempted extubation, palliative withdrawal of life support, or death prior to an extubation attempt.  Patients requiring re-intubation within 72 hours of extubation were determined to have failed extubation and were compared to patients who had successful extubation.  Differences between the two groups were analyzed with a p value &lt; 0.05 signifying statistical significance. Multiple regression analysis was used to control for age, injury severity score, and vent days prior to extubation.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1,613 patients met inclusion criteria with 103 (6.4%) of those in the failed extubation group.  Patients who failed extubation were older, had higher injury severity score, more ventilator days prior to extubation, and more intensive care unit and hospital days.  Patients who failed extubation were more likely to have cervical spine fractures (21.4% versus 8.2%, p = &lt;0.0001) and more likely to have rib fractures (39.8% versus 23.4%, p = 0.0002).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Cervical spine fractures and rib fractures are risk factors predictive of failed extubation despite successful spontaneous breathing trial.  These patients may require additional weaning criteria to better determine chances of successful liberation from mechanical ventilation.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Practice patterns including indications for prophylaxis, agents used, and duration of extended VTE prophylaxis were studied.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 80 surgeons, the majority (80%) of whom staff Level 1 trauma centers, responded from 56 hospitals.  Nearly all (98%) respondents believed the risk of VTE was elevated following traumatic injury. All respondents utilized VTE chemoprophylaxis for trauma inpatients.  Although 72 (90%) responding surgeons believed certain trauma patients should receive chemoprophylaxis following discharge, only 50 (62%) routinely discharged these patients on extended prophylaxis.  The most common indications for extended VTE prophylaxis identified by respondents were prolonged immobility and orthopedic trauma.  The most common agents utilized were low molecular weight heparin and aspirin.  Specific drug dosage and duration were highly variable.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Current practice patterns surrounding extended VTE prophylaxis in trauma patients are highly variable despite widespread belief that extended prophylaxis is warranted in certain patients.

To augment ongoing efforts to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), we sought to limit durations that CVCs are in place by placing PIVs and removing CVC as quickly as possible. Because PIV placement in critically ill patients is often difficult, we developed a team of surgical intensive care unit (SICU) nurses trained to use ultrasound (US) to place PIVs in SICU patients. We hypothesized that training SICU nurses to use US guidance for PIV placement in critically ill patients would reduce CVC catheter days and thereby reduce the rate of CLABSI. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We retrospectively reviewed data gathered prospectively from 2011 through 2014 regarding individual attempts by the nursing team at US-guided PIV (US-PIV) placement and further evaluated pre-existing SICU quality databases of central line usage, patient census, and incidence of CLABSI from 2009 to 2014. Monthly rates of central line usage were calculated from central line days and patient days.  Rates of CLABSI were evaluated quarterly as infections per 1000 central line days. Differences between rates before and after implementation of the US-PIV team were analyzed via Kruskal-Wallis testing.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From 2011 to 2014, 2748 attempts at US-PIV placement were recorded, with placement of 2440 PIVs in 1646 patients (success rate 89%).  Rates of central line usage trended down from 61.8 central line days per 100 patient days before US-PIV team implementation (monthly range 49.6-76.0) to 58.7 central line days per 100 patient days after its implementation (38.6-81.5, p=0.208).  CLABSI incidence decreased substantially from a rate of 2.40 per 1000 patient days prior to US-PIV team creation (quarterly range 1.48-3.46) to 0.85 per 1000 patient days thereafter (0-2.43, p=0.0009).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Properly trained SICU nurses can be highly successful at US guided PIV placement. Implementation of this technology was associated with decreased central line usage and CLABSI when used in conjunction with other infection-reducing efforts. Effective CLABSI prevention requires a multifaceted approach; creation of a nursing team trained to place PIVs using ultrasound may be a useful adjunct to standard practices in improving these quality measures.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

The relationship between this biomarker and outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, however, is still unknown. This retrospective study examined the association between lactate clearance and mortality in trauma patients with and without TBI.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Lactate values of trauma patients admitted to the emergency department between 2010-2014 were retrieved from patient files. Patients without initial lactate drawn within 30 minutes after admission, or without a second lactate measurement within 8 hours after admission, were excluded. Lactate clearance was calculated based on modified methods described by Odom et al. (2013) [(Lactate<sub>initial</sub> &ndash; Lactate<sub>delayed</sub>) / Lactate<sub>initial</sub> &times; 100%]; R&eacute;gnier et al. (2012) [(Lactate<sub>initial </sub>&ndash; Lactate<sub>delayed</sub>) / Lactate<sub>initial</sub> &times; 100% &times; Delay<sup>&minus;1</sup>]; and Billeter et al. (2009) [four groups: (1) always below 2.5mmol/L, (2) decreasing below 2.5mmol/L, (3) increasing above 2.5mmol/L, and (4) always above 2.5mmol/L]. We studied the association between lactate clearance and in-hospital mortality in patients with isolated TBI, TBI combined with extracerebral injuries, and trauma patients without TBI.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of the 3000 admitted trauma patients, 818 (27.2%) had an initial lactate measurement. 367 patients (12.2%) were eligible for lactate clearance calculations. A high initial lactate was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality [OR = 1.20, 95% CI: (1.13 &ndash; 1.27), P&lt;0.001]. We found a significant relationship between the lactate clearance method of Billeter et al. and in-hospital mortality (Wald chi-square = 14.614, P=0.002). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons only revealed a significant difference between groups 1 and 4 [Bonferroni corrected P=0.002, OR = 3.59, 95% CI: (1.86 &ndash; 6.93)]. There was no association between lactate clearance and in-hospital mortality using the methods of Odom et al. and R&eacute;gnier et al. Initial lactate value and Billeter's lactate clearance method did not differ in their ability to predict in-hospital mortality [AUC 0.64, 95% CI: (0.56 &ndash; 0.71) vs. AUC 0.64, 95% CI: (0.57 &ndash; 0.71), P=0.71]. Neither initial lactate nor lactate clearance differed between isolated TBI, polytrauma + TBI, and general trauma without TBI patients.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the first study to investigate the relationship between lactate clearance and outcome in TBI patients, and the first to compare three previously described lactate clearance metrics. In contrast to the available literature for the general trauma patient, only lactate clearance using the method of Billeter et al. predicted mortality in trauma patients with and without TBI. However, in our patient population we found no clinical advantage of using Billeter's lactate clearance method, as the initial lactate value was equally effective in its ability to predict in-hospital mortality.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

We assessed whether our transfusion practice varied respective of which primary service admitted the patient to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU).  We hypothesized that average pre-transfusion hemoglobin levels for patients on elective surgery services, Otorhinolaryngology (ENT), Vascular, and general surgery, would be significantly higher than hemoglobin triggers for Emergency General Surgery (EGS) and Trauma services, despite the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) operating as a closed unit.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The expected practice of the SICU team is to transfuse packed red blood cells (PRBCs) according to the standards established by the TRICC trial. We used a semantic layer construct to identify pre-transfusion hemoglobin levels for SICU patients between June 2014 and May 2015. Patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage were excluded. Self-service electronic health record (EHR) data reporting was used to aggregate patients by primary surgical service and retrieve medical history, BMI, and age for transfused patients. Independent samples T-tests and Fischer's exact tests were used to assess differences between groups<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:403 surgical patients were transfused &ge; 1 units of PRBCs during the study period.  Average pre-transfusion hemoglobin level was significantly lower for EGS compared to the ENT and Vascular services. The average pre-transfusion hemoglobin level for Trauma was also significantly lower compared to Vascular (see Table). Two or more units were transfused in 37% of transfusion instances. EGS was the only service found to have a significant difference in average pre-transfusion hemoglobin for patients that received one unit (7.19 &plusmn; 0.28) versus two units (6.72 &plusmn; 0.44; p=0.042).  The prevalence of coronary artery disease was similar between all services.  ENT patients were significantly older than EGS (p=0.016) and Trauma (p&lt;0.01) patients, while Vascular patients were significantly older than Trauma patients (p&lt;0.01).  EGS patients were more likely to have a history of diabetes mellitus as compared to both Trauma and ENT patients (p=0.01, p=0.039) and more likely than Trauma patients to have hypertension (p=0.041).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:This review of the transfusion practice in our SICU demonstrates variability in transfusion practice for patients on ENT and Vascular services as compared to the other services and is not justified by an increased incidence of comorbid conditions. We also have a high incidence of multiple unit transfusions.

This problem is even more magnified in elderly patients with cervical spine fractures as neck positioning and altered physiology may further predispose these patients to complications.  Fractures of the cervical spine can span the entire length of the neck from C1 to C7.  It stands to reason that injuries at different levels of the cervical spine could influence swallowing function in unique ways.  This study seeks to investigate how the level of cervical fracture in elderly patients who are non-operatively managed impacts the incidence of dysphagia.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Medical records of all  trauma patients age 65 and older admitted with cervical fractures between January 2008 and April 2014 to a level 1 trauma center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a past medical history of dysphagia or stroke or who had operatively managed fractures were excluded, leaving 123 patients for analysis.  Bedside evaluation of swallowing function was performed and any patients with evidence of swallowing dysfunction had formal speech therapy consultation.  Dysphagia was defined as any restriction or diet modification as a result of swallowing dysfunction after speech therapy assessment.  Demographic data, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit days, ventilator days, injury severity score, mortality and level of cervical fracture were analyzed. P values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  Multiple regression analysis was used to control for confounding variables.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 123 patients met inclusion criteria and 19 (15.4%) of those patients had dysphagia Patients with dysphagia were older (86.3 &plusmn; 8.01 vs. 80.6 &plusmn; 8.76, p = 0.007), had higher hospital length of stay (7.4 &plusmn;4.23 vs 4.3 &plusmn; 4.21, p = 0.016), and were more likely to have intensive care unit days (47.4% vs 20.2%, p=0.01)..  Patients with C1 fractures were more likely to have dysphagia than patients with other cervical fractures (29.2% vs 7.1%, p = 0.0008).  After using regression analysis to control for total length of stay, any intensive care unit days, and age, C1 fracture increased the likelihood of dysphagia by 4 times (OR = 4.0; 95% CI 1.2-13.0)<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Incidence of dysphagia is significant in geriatric trauma patients with cervical spine fractures and has important ramifications for patient outcomes such as hospital length of stay.

Readmissions after traumatic injury are frequent, and older trauma patients are at increased risk for poor outcomes in both morbidity and mortality. Determining an appropriate destination after discharge in this population is difficult, and may impact readmission rates. Prior literature evaluating discharge destination's impact on patient outcome is limited and conflicting; no prior study has evaluated this relationship in older trauma patients. The objective of this study was to explore the association between the discharge destination and rate of 30-day readmission in older trauma patients.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A database of all patients age 45 years or older undergoing trauma evaluation at our American College of Surgeons verified level 1 trauma center over a 1-year period was used to retrospectively compare frequency of 30-day readmission to the center between patients discharged to home, to inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and to other extended care facilities (ECFs, including long term acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and nursing homes). Further abstracted potentially confounding factors were trauma activation level, injury severity score, comorbidity-polypharmacy score, age, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, Glasgow coma score, gender, pre-trauma functional status (independent, partially dependent, or dependent), and pre-trauma residence (home, rehab, or ECF). Inmates, patients who died during their hospitalizations, and patients who were discharged to hospice were excluded from analysis. Univariate analysis was undertaken using chi-square testing. Multiple logistic regression was performed with all the above variables to evaluate for independent contribution to readmission risk.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 960 patients age 45 and older were evaluated over the study period; 81 (8.4%) were excluded and 879 patients age 45-103 were included in the analysis. Seventy-six patients (8.6%) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, including 6% of patients discharged to home, 14% discharged to ECF, and 19% discharged to rehab (p=0.00009 on univariate analysis). 557 (63%) patients had data recorded for all variables analyzed using multiple logistic regression; among these, only discharge destination was independently associated with the rate of readmission (p=0.019).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Unplanned hospital readmission following traumatic injury is common in older patients and is used as a marker of hospital quality. In this first study of outcomes based on discharge destination of older trauma patients, discharge to inpatient rehabilitation or other extended care facilities was a strong independent risk factor for hospital readmissions. Though causes of this association are likely multifactorial, recognition of this risk factor may aid in the disposition planning of these patients and suggests the need for further evaluation of this correlation at other centers.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

At our Level 1 Trauma center, the primary method used is placement of a pelvic binder followed by angioembolization. Angioembolization is performed by a interventional radiology (IR) team which is not in house at night or on weekends. We hypothesized that individuals with pelvic hemorrhage requiring embolization who present to the emergency department (ED) after business hours have an increased time to angioembolization, require more blood products, and have a higher mortality compared to those presenting during business hours.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: The IR database was used to identify individuals who underwent emergent pelvic angioembolization secondary to blunt trauma from January 2008 to December 2013. These were divided into, the business hours (BH) group, defined as those presenting to the ED between 7:30 AM and 5:30 PM Monday to Friday and the after business hours group (ABH) defined as those presenting to the ED on weekends, holidays or between the hours of 5:30 PM and 7:30 AM. A chart review was used to obtain the time of ED presentation, presence of contrast extravasation on CT, start time of angioembolization, units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfused and if the patient went to the operating room prior to IR.  The trauma database was used to obtain initial vitals, demographics, ISS and mortality. Continuous variables were analyzed with the Mann Whitney U test and categorical data was analyzed using the Fisher exact test.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Ninety nine patients meet inclusion criteria (64 ABH vs 35 BH). There was no difference in initial vitals or demographics. The ISS was similar between the groups (median, 27 ABH vs 26 minutes BH). A blush was present on CT in 63% of the ABH vs 57% in the BH (p=0.67).  25% of the ABH went to the OR prior to IR vs 17% in the BH (p=0.45). There was no difference in PRBCs transfused (median, 6.5 ABH vs 5 BH, p=0.27). There was a significant difference in the time to IR (median, 304 minutes ABH vs 219 minutes BH).  Ten patients died within 30 days in the ABH vs 6 in the BH group (p=0.78). There were five deaths from hemorrhage in the first 24 hours in the ABH compared to one in the BH group (p=0.32).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Individuals who arrive after hours, on weekends, or holidays who require angioembolization to control pelvic hemorrhage, require more time to arrive in the IR suite for management.  Although they require more time to arrive in the IR suite, our data does not demonstrate an increase in 30 day mortality, the number of PRBCs transfused, or the number of patients who died from hemorrhage in the ABH group.  A limitation of our study is the ability to determine the number of patients who died in both groups while waiting for IR.  We have demonstrated there is an increased time to pelvic angioembolization in those presenting outside of business hours, however, there is no difference in mortality if the patient is able to arrive in IR.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

We sought to examine the impact of age on outcomes in TBI patients who do not require neurosurgical operative intervention.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This was a retrospective review of all patients with survivable head injuries undergoing nonoperative management at a Level I trauma center from 2008-2013. Patients were stratified by age into young and elderly groups using the age of 40 as a reference group based upon the current Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines. Logistic regression was used to adjust for baseline differences in demographic and injury variables to determine the effect of age on outcomes. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, worsening discharge GCS, and discharge disposition.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1,869 patients met inclusion criteria with 77% of patients being older than 40 years. Elderly patients were more likely to be victims of falls and presented with a higher GCS despite having a higher Head AIS. Immediate need for non-intracranial operative intervention was greater in younger patients. After adjusting for differences in characteristics, there was no significant difference in overall mortality (Elderly 3.6% vs. young 5%, p=0.209) or worsening discharge GCS (14% vs. 11%, p=0.926). However, younger patients were more likely to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility or home (91% vs. 70%, AOR=2.4, p=0.001). Stratification of mortality by decade revealed similar results, with adjusted mortality being lower in the sixth and ninth decades of life (Figure).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Survival of patients sustaining TBI not requiring neurosurgical operative intervention may not be age dependent. However, age is associated with a less favorable discharge disposition that is independent of discharge GCS.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Although minimally injured patients could potentially be discharged home, a recent regional study showed that 9.8% of these seemingly uninjured patients seen at level 3 and 4 trauma centers were transferred to a higher level of care prior to being discharged. We analyze these occurrences at the national level to identify patient characteristics and injury patterns which may facilitate the development of strategies to reduce overtriage rates. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data from the National Trauma Data Bank was obtained from 2008-2012 to isolate those who were: 1) discharged home within 48h of arrival, and 2) did not undergo a surgical procedure. We then identified those who arrived as a transfer to a Level 1 or 2 Trauma Center prior to being discharged (secondary overtriage) from those who were discharged directly from a Level 3 or 4 Trauma Center. Factors associated with transfer were analyzed using a logistic regression. Injuries were classified based on the need for a specific consultant.  Co-morbidities examined included: smoking status, functionally dependent status, diabetes, and history of cerebrovascular accidents.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Descriptive analysis showed a number of differences between transfers and non-transfers due to our large sample size. Those who were not transferred tended to be older than 65 years (21.3% vs. 15.5%) and female (35.3% vs. 26.9%).  Rates of hypotension (SBP&lt;90mmHg) were low (0.6% vs. 1.3%) and those with ISS&gt;15 were more likely to be transferred (10.5% vs. 3.7%). No clinically significant differences in co-morbidities were found between groups. We examined the more siginificant variables using a logistic regression controlling for age, gender, ISS, SBP&lt;90, and injury pattern (Table 1). Neurosurgical injuries, vertebral injuries, and facial injuries were associated to an increased risk of transfer, while orthopedic injuries were protective. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Secondary overtriage results from a combination of limited hospital resources, patient characteristics, and injury pattern.  Although some injuries such as mild traumatic brain injuries and stable spine fractures are managed expectantly, it seems that they may be the underlying reason behind many of these transfers.  A fear of an underdiagnosed or a progressing central nervous system injury may prompt a referral to a specialist for evaluation.  Orthopedic injuries may involve a mechanism isolated to a single limb and therefore be considered more stable.  Further studies into how these types of injuries are treated at Level 3 and 4 trauma centers may help reduce inefficiencies stemming from unnecessary transfers.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Britt<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Eastern Virginia Medical School,Surgery,Norfolk, VA, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>:  For many years, the rates of surgical site infections (SSIs) have been stratified according to wound classification by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and American College of Surgery-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP).  However, these predicted rates are used universally for all surgical procedures and may not be applicable to the emergency surgery population.  Acute care surgery (ACS) and trauma patients are at an increased risk for infection for a variety of reasons.  This study was designed to determine whether the rates of surgical site infections in ACS and trauma patients are higher than the accepted standards.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of patients admitted to the trauma and ACS services at a level I trauma center that underwent midline laparotomy between July 2011 and June 2013 was performed.   Patients were excluded if death occurred within one week of admission or if the abdomen remained open for over 72 hours.  Demographic data, risk factors, ASA classification, type of surgery, wound classification, length of stay and presence of either a deep organ space infection or superficial SSI were analyzed.  The rates of surgical site infections were stratified by wound classification and compared to the CDC rates of superficial SSIs and the ACS-NSQIP rates of deep organ space infections.  All results noted were significant if p&lt;0.05.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the study period there were 178 patients on the ACS service and 107 patients on the trauma service that underwent midline laparotomy and met inclusion criteria.  Rates of superficial SSIs were not significantly different between historic CDC rates and our trauma patient population across all wound classes.  Using the ACS-NSQIP reported data, there were significantly more deep organ space infections in contaminated wounds (27.3% vs 2.6%, p&lt;0.05).  In the ACS patient population, there were significantly more superficial SSIs in the clean/contaminated wounds (27.7% vs 11%, p&lt;0.05) when compared to CDC rates.  There were also significantly more deep space organ infections in the clean/contaminated, contaminated and dirty wounds when compared to the ACS-NSQIP data (10.8% vs 1.9%, 30% vs 2.6% and 25% vs 4.5%, respectively, p&lt;0.05).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Trauma and acute care surgery patients have a significantly higher rate of deep organ space infections than the standard estimates when compared to ACS-NSQIP published data.  This is likely due to the emergent nature of the cases and increased comorbidities in this patient population.  Larger studies should be done to determine if this is true nationwide.  If so, a different standard of surgical site infections should be adopted for these patient populations to more accurately reflect the true rate of postoperative infectious complications in these patients.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

However; the optimum size for NI remains unclear.  The aim of this study was to define the optimum size of isolated ICH (epidural [EDH] or SDH [SDH]) for NI in patients with TBI. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a 5 year retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of all patients with an isolated EDH or SDH to our level 1 trauma center. The outcome measure was need for neurosurgical intervention. . Neurosurgical intervention was defined as craniotomy and/or craniectomy.

In patient with SDH/EDH 6mm is the optimal threshold determining the need for NI while it is lower at 4.5mm in patient on AP/AC therapy. This will help establish guidelines based on the size of ICH for better defining the criteria for NI in patients with TBI and isolated ICH.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Current treatment consists of rapid transport to a trauma center and emergent laparotomy. Three potential prehospital hemorrhage control interventions that could lead to improved outcomes are resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA), self-expanding foam and the abdominal junctional tourniquet (AJT).  The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess the number of patients who had intra-abdominal injury and received a laparotomy that could have potentially benefited from one of these three new interventions.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   This retrospective study included patients who received an emergent trauma laparotomy between 1/1/2013 to 1/1/2015 at an urban Level 1 trauma center. We reviewed all the injuries found at laparotomy and based on the specific indications for each device determined if the patients would have been potentially helped or hurt by each of the three interventions. For instance, the AJT only controls bleeding from injuries below the aortic bifurcation (located below the umbilicus), while the foam is contraindicated in patients with large abdominal wall defects or diaphragm injuries.  McNemar's test was used with Bonferonni correction for statistical analysis (&alpha;=0.017).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  402 patients met the inclusion criteria. REBOA was potentially beneficial for 384, (96%) of patients, foam was potentially beneficial for 351, (87%), while the AJT was potentially beneficial for only 35, (9%).  There was no significant difference between REBOA and foam (p=0.022), while there was a difference between REBOA or foam and AJT (p&lt;0.001).  There were 170 (42%) patients with penetrating injuries, while only 9 (5%) patients with penetrating injuries would have been potentially helped by the AJT.  33 patients had cutaneous wounds located in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), while 45 patients had cutaneous wounds located in the left lower quadrant (LLQ).  Diaphragm injuries occurred in 58 (14%) of patients, with REBOA potentially of benefit in 55 of those patients, while foam would have potentially helped only 36.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  REBOA and foam both would potentially benefit the largest number of patients, (&ge; 87%) who had intra-abdominal injury and laparotomy.  AJT was found to be helpful in only 9% of patients in need of prehospital intervention for hemorrhage. These results suggest that the AJT should not be used for prehospital hemorrhage control unless it is absolutely sure that all injuries causing hemorrhage are below the aortic bifurcation.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

However, its effect on outcomes after trauma operations has never been explored. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of active smoking on outcomes in patients who underwent surgery after trauma.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We did a two year (2011-2012) analysis of national trauma data bank. We included all critically injured (minimum AIS&ge;3, and required ICU admission during their stay) adult trauma patients who underwent surgical procedure on day 1. Patients, who died in ED, arrived with no vital signs, intoxicated, and fatally injured (AIS&ge;6) were excluded from the analysis. Our outcome measures were in-hospital complications, mortality, failure to rescue (FTR), hospital and ICU length of stay, and days on ventilator. Patients were divided into two groups based on their smoking status. Groups were matched using propensity score matching after adjusting for age, gender, race, injury severity, head AIS, admission vitals, and comorbidities. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: After propensity score matching 17,198 patients (Smokers: 8,599, Non-Smokers: 8,599) were included in the analysis. Mean age of the population was 46&plusmn;18, 75% were male, median [IQR] ISS was 16 [10-25], median [IQR] AIS was 4[3-4], and overall mortality in our population was 8%. There was no difference in basic demographics of the groups. Overall rate of complications was significantly higher in smokers compared to non-smokers (52% vs 47%, p&lt;0.001) and they were more likely to develop surgical site wound complications compared to non-smokers (4% vs 3%, p=0.02). Smokers had longer ICU length of stay (Median [IQR]: 3[2-7] vs. 3[2-6], p=0.04) and ventilator days (Median [IQR]: 0[0-3] vs. 0[0-2], p=0.02) compared to non-smokers.

Of the 18.1% of trauma patients discharged to post-acute care, 19.5% are discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF). Admission to IRF is based on expected functional improvement, but there is little data that documents benefit in injured patients. The purpose of this study was to quantify functional improvements experienced by trauma patients after discharge from IRF and identify predictors of functional improvement.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data were retrospectively collected on patients &ge;18 yrs old admitted after injury to a Level 1 trauma center from January, 2012, to March, 2013, and discharged to IRF. Data included demographics, injury characteristics, hospital course (e.g. procedures, length of stay (LOS)), and IRF course (e.g. LOS). The functional independence measure (FIM) was used to measure change in physical and cognitive function from IRF admission to discharge. The FIM score is the sum of scores (range 1 (total assistance) to 7 (total independence)) from 18 domains (13 motor, 5 cognitive).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 136 patients with a mean (SD) age of 56 yrs (21.3). Most (99.3%) were living at home, alone or with support, at time of injury. Mean Charlson Comorbidity Score (CCS) was 0.17 (0.46). Fall was the leading mechanism of injury (44.9%). Median (range) injury severity score (ISS) was 9 (0-45). Median hospital LOS was 8 days (2-89). Mean IRF LOS was 14.3 days (8.07). Due to extenuating circumstances, 11 were transferred to other IRFs and not included. Of the remainder, FIM scores were available for 124. On IRF admission, 43.6% required moderate assistance or greater. From IRF admission to discharge, the mean intra-individual change in FIM score was 28.3 (18.0); 84.7% improved &ge;1 levels of independence. On discharge from IRF, 53.2% were at a modified independent level of independence or better; 49.6% were discharged home (with family or agency support); 20.8% were discharged to skilled nursing facility; 21.6% were readmitted to acute care; 8.0% were discharged home independently. Using multivariable analysis, for every 1 yr increase in age, improvement in FIM scores decreased by 0.15 (p=0.05) when adjusted for CCS, primary injury (PI), ISS, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and IRF LOS. For chest PI, improvement in FIM scores decreased by 17.2 (p=0.04) when adjusted for age, CCS, ISS, ICU stay, and IRF LOS. For every 1 day increase in IRF LOS, improvement in FIM scores increased by 0.65 (p=0.002) when adjusted for age, CCS, PI, ISS, and ICU stay.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Trauma patients experienced improved functionality after admission to IRF: 80.7% of patients experienced an increase in level of independence. However, despite this improvement, 42.4% of patients were unable to be discharged home. While significant predictors of functional improvement are non-modifiable, they are known at time of acute hospital admission and can help with early resource planning.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Therefore we examined trauma populations to determine whether patients demonstrated statistically significant differences in mortality under mono- and polytrauma conditions.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We examined data from an initial population of 38000 patient encounters from 1994 to present, yielding a final sample size of approximately 25000. Raw data were cleaned and analyzed using our RMM that describes the overall performance in relation to the anticipated mortality (benchmark TRISS threshold) and observed mortality, where RMM has a range from -1 to 1. Monotrauma (n=8606) and polytrauma (n=16250) were analyzed (defined as a single or multiple AIS-coded injuries in the registry). The relation was further evaluated by stratifying patients into subpopulations based on their overall number of injuries (1, 2-5, 6-10, and 11+) and evaluating mortality differences. Additionally, a second polytrauma definition (&gt;2 injuries with AIS score &gt;2) was used to assess whether patient group mortality differences held. Finally, head monotrauma was separated from the rest of the monotrauma patient population in order to determine if single high mortality head injuries could be driving monotrauma toward greater expected mortality.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: When each population was plotted across all AIS values and regions, no significant difference in RMM value between mono- and polytrauma was found (RMM values of 0.3392 and 0.3576, respectively) and each curve fell within the 95% confidence interval of the other. Furthermore, when data was divided by AIS region, the two largest groups (head+face and extremity) mirrored the overall trends. Subsequent analysis of injury number-stratified polytrauma subpopulations again showed no significant difference between mono- and polytrauma. Lastly, when head monotrauma was separated from the rest of the monotrauma population, there was again no significant shift of the curve toward increased patient survival relative to the polytrauma population.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We hypothesized that polytrauma would result in increased mortality due to the compounding effects of multiple sites of injury. However, it was seen that there is no notable difference in the mortality gap as defined by RMM value between different anatomical sites when comparing mono- and polytrauma. This trend held even when confounding factors such as differing levels of polytrauma and the sometimes more severe nature of singular head injuries were controlled for.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Using a standard protocol for documenting duration of tourniquet use, this study investigates outcomes following prehospital tourniquet application.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review was performed for prehospital tourniquet application in a metropolitan trauma system from 2011 to 2014.  Demographics, injury details, sensorimotor exam, transfusion data, operative treatment, complications and outcome were analyzed.  The need for a tourniquet was deemed appropriate if a major artery was injured or the attending trauma surgeon reapplied the tourniquet in the emergency room for significant bleeding.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 38 patients with a total of 39 extremities had tourniquets applied.  1 patient died (3%). Median transport time was 8 minutes. Median ischemia time from placement to removal in ED or OR was 49 minutes.  3 (8%) patients had a prehospital amputation and 4 (11%) had partial amputations.  A systolic blood pressure&lt;90 occurred in 9 (26%) prehospital and 12 (32%) in the ED.  5 (14%) required a massive transfusion. 18 (47%) had major arterial injury and 15 (40%) major venous injury.  30 (79%) required emergency surgery with 2 (5%) undergoing fasciotomy. Tourniquets were deemed appropriate in 16 (42%), likely inappropriate in 14 (37%) and questionable in 8 (21%).  17 (47%) patients survived with intact sensation. 11 (31%) survived with a sensation or motor deficit, and 7 (19%) required amputation.  No complication could be definitively linked to tourniquet use.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Tourniquet placement in the civilian setting is associated with a high rate of major arterial or venous injury, with a significant majority of patients requiring emergency surgery.  Tourniquet application was safe, as we did not identify a single case in which harm could be attributed to tourniquet use.

Based on studies that show 2-5 times the mortality in patients &ge; 65 with 2 or more rib fractures, our academic institution and Level I trauma center recommends intensive care unit (ICU) admission for the first 24 hours. In this study, we aim to evaluate the utilization of the protocol and outcomes of this patient population. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review was completed of all patients &ge; 65 years of age in our Trauma Registry who sustained isolated rib fractures from January, 2008 to March, 2015 at an urban Level I Trauma center. Data included basic demographics, comorbidities, injuries, length of intensive care unit and hospital stay (LOS), ventilator days, analgesic used, morbidity, mortality and disposition. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over the 7 year period, a total of 97 patients &ge; 65 years of age with at least one rib fracture and an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) of &lt; 2 for other regions were admitted. The median age of these patients was 80 years, 55% were female, and 90% had two or more rib fractures. Fall was the cause of 58% of injuries, while motor vehicle collision (MVC) accounted for 33%. Of the 87 patients with more than one rib fracture, 69 (71%) were not admitted directly to the ICU and 6 (9%) of those were subsequently transferred to the ICU with a mortality of 2.9% for patients with &ge;2 rib fractures not admitted directly to the ICU. Of the 4 (4%) mortalities, 3 were caused by falls and 1 by MVC. Patients who fell had a median hospital LOS that was 0.5 to 1 day longer than patients who suffered other mechanisms of injury or were involved in a MVC respectively. Patients aged 70 or older had a median length of stay of 4 days, twice the median length of stay for those between 65 to 69 years old. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: With an aging population, trauma in the elderly will continue to increase, likely with a high volume of rib fractures. It is critical to understand the best course of triage and management for this high risk population. We found that falls were the most common mechanism of injury and had the highest median LOS and median number of rib fractures. We also found that patients over the age of 70 had a longer median LOS than those younger and admitting all patients &ge; 65 years of age is likely not necessary, though further research is needed to determine more discrete age and fracture cut-offs.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

We aimed to determine the incidence of swallowing dysfunction in our elderly trauma patient population.  Additionally, we wished to evaluate the clinical impact of newly diagnosed swallowing dysfunction in this group and determine risk factors for dysphagia to identify patients that might benefit from screening. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective review of our trauma database from 2009 - 2012 was conducted. Injured patients &ge;75 years who had newly diagnosed swallowing dysfunction by video swallow study were identified.  A comparison group without dysphagia was also identified from this time period that was frequency matched by age, gender, injury mechanism, and injury severity score (ISS). Relevant demographics and injury characteristics were collected along with patient comorbidities, complications (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, stroke, etc.), hospital length of stay (LOS), and discharge disposition. The groups were compared using Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for interval or continuous variables.  Factors which reached statistical significance (p&lt;0.05) on univariable analysis were then used to create a multivariable logistic regression model to determine independent risk factors for dysphagia.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: In total, 1323 patients met age and injury criteria. Of these, 56 (4.2%) had newly identified swallowing dysfunction; the majority (n=38, 68%) were male. The average age and ISS were 84.38 (SD=4.54) and 11.29 (SD=6.26), respectively. The majority (85%) of patients were injured due to a fall. Comorbidities were similar between cases and controls. Regional injury patterns were also similar.  On univariate analysis, patients with dysphagia had higher rates of pneumonia (15 % vs. 4 %, p&lt;0.05), longer ICU LOS (5.6 vs. 1.9 days, p &lt; 0.01), and longer hospital LOS (11.4 vs. 5.8 days, p &lt; 0.01).

Prophylaxis against stress gastropathy is recommended in national guidelines, and the standard of care is pharmacologic acid suppressive therapy. There are data that support the concept that patients tolerating enteral nutrition have sufficient gut blood flow to obviate the need for prophylaxis; however, no robust studies exist. The current standard in our academic level 1 trauma center is to discontinue pharmacologic prophylaxis once enteral nutrition is providing full caloric requirements. This retrospective cohort study assesses the incidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding in surgical-trauma intensive care unit (STICU) patients at risk of stress gastropathy secondary to mechanical ventilation in this setting.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective chart review was performed of adult patients admitted to the STICU between 2008 and 2013.  The primary objective was to assess the incidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding. Secondary objectives include the rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and mortality. Patients were included if they received full enteral nutrition while on mechanical ventilation. Exclusion criteria included any coagulopathy, glucocorticoid use, prior-to-admission acid suppressive therapy use for other indications, direct trauma or surgery to the stomach, failure to tolerate enteral nutrition goal, and orders to allow natural death. Patients were excluded if pharmacologic stress ulcer prophylaxis was not discontinued during intensive care unit stay.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 239 patients were included. The median age was 42 years, 81.2% were male, and 96.7% were trauma patients. The incidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding was 0.42%, with a subset analysis of traumatic brain injury patients yielding an incidence of 0.57%. Rates of VAP and CDI were low at 1.24 cases/1000 vent days and 0.71 events/1000 patient days, respectively. Hospital all-cause mortality was 1.7%. An average $242 per patient was saved by discontinuing medication. The incidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding was comparable to historic rates of bleeding with provision of pharmacologic stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient population studied is limited to predominantly trauma patients with mechanical ventilation and/or traumatic brain injury as risks for stress gastropathy.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We conclude that stress gastropathy is rare in this population. Surgical trauma patients who are at risk for stress gastropathy may not benefit from pharmacologic prophylaxis once they tolerate enteral nutrition.

We sought to evaluate the prevalence and outcomes of extremity compartment syndrome at a suburban regional trauma center.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The trauma registry was retrospectively reviewed for all admitted adult (age&gt;18) blunt trauma patients admitted from 2010 to 2014.  Deaths in the emergency department and burns were excluded.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During this time period, there 6173 adult blunt trauma admissions, of which 87 developed extremity compartment syndrome and were further evaluated (table).  Their median age was 44 years [IQR 32.5-55] and the vast majority (90.8%) were male.  While 76.9% had a National Trauma Data Standard (NTDS) defined comorbidity, 36.8% had &ge;  2 NTDS defined comorbidities.  The most common mechanism was MVC (46.0%) followed by fall (23.0%).  The median ISS was 9 [IQR 5-17]. The primary severe injury (AIS &gt;3) locations in order of frequency were extremity (63.2%), followed by chest (16.1%), and abdomen (12.6%).  Further 96.5% of these patients underwent major surgery, with the overwhelming majority being major orthopedic surgery (96.5%), followed by major abdominal surgery (8.0%).  The median hospital LOS was 17 days [IQR 11-26], 34.5% required ICU admission with a median ICU LOS of 6 days [IQR 3.4-19.5], and 34.5% required mechanical ventilation.  Further 44.8% had a complication.  While 65.5% of admissions were discharged to home, 32.2% did require acute rehabilitation, and 2.3% died during hospitalization. This mortality rate was not significantly different from the rate in other blunt trauma patients (4.0%).The vast majority (82.7%) of patients had lower extremity compartment syndrome.  The most commonly injured bone associated with a compartment syndrome was the tibia (61.5%, n=48); in these 48 patients, it was associated with fibula fractures in 32 patients and with acetabular or other lower extremity fractures in 18 patients.

With up to 75% of car seats improperly installed nationally, we propose to characterize a novel valet parking attendant car seat safety injury prevention program and to assess the potential impact when established in a hospital setting.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: : A voluntary, 22 question, anonymous survey was distributed to drivers utilizing the valet parking service in a single suburban Children's Hospital on weekdays during August 2014.  Demographic information, previous car seat installation education or experience, and interest in using a free car seat inspection program were ascertained.  Concurrently, a valet parking attendant, who was also a trained car seat technician, offered to provide a free inspection of any car seats.  Any errors in installation were immediately corrected and the driver was educated about proper technique.  The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics using n Query Advisor 4.0 including a power analysis to determine the sample size. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Survey results were collected from 65 participants.  Among these, 16 car seats were inspected and only 3 (18.8%) were installed correctly.  A minority of participants reported that they had received car seat installation education (29 out of 63, 46%) or had their car seat installed by a trained technician (13 out of 65, 20%).  Most reported that they would use a car seat inspection program (63 out of 65, 96.9%) and that it should be provided by hospitals (61 out of 65, 93.8%).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Proper car seat installation in a suburban New York setting is lower than the reported national average of 25%.  Despite 97% stated interest in a free car seat inspection program, at most, only 25% completed car seat inspection when offered.

However, the risk of VTE after splenectomy for trauma remains largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the risk of VTE following splenectomy for trauma.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Adults with blunt/penetrating splenic injuries treated at Level I/II trauma centers included in the National Trauma Data Bank 2009-2011 were analyzed. The primary outcome was the development of a VTE. ICD-9-CM diagnoses codes were used to determine patients who underwent a splenectomy, as well as other major surgical procedures. Multiple logistic regression analyses, with VTE as the outcome, were performed, adjusting for patient level (demographics, injury severity characteristics, major surgical procedures) and hospital level factors (rate of hospital duplex ultrasound). Additional sensitivity analyses were performed stratifying by hospital length of stay and hospital duplex ultrasound rates.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 19,124 patients were included of whom 4,221 (22.10%) underwent a splenectomy. Only 198 (1.00%) patients underwent an isolated splenectomy. The overall VTE rate was 4.90% (932). On univariate and multivariate analyses, the odds ratios (95% CI) for the development of VTE were found to be 2.00 (1.74-2.30) and 1.48 (1.23-1.77), respectively. However, splenectomy was no longer associated with an increased risk of VTE when additionally adjusted for the presence of concomitant major surgical procedures [0.90 (0.76-1.08)]. Additional sensitivity analyses revealed qualitatively similar findings.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Splenectomy, in the presence of concomitant major surgical procedures, does not confer an additional risk of a VTE event.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Age, sex, ISS, injuries, operations, DVT prophylaxis, IVC filter placement, specific CTA findings of PE, septic episodes and blood products administered were recorded.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 77 patients had a diagnosis of 'PE', but 12 had incomplete data or previous underlying diseases that affected their VTE risk. The remaining 65 patients were placed into the four categories: Group 1: 29 patients (45%) patients represented cases where the protocol for prophylactic IVC filter placement was not followed. Group 2: 11 patients (17%) were identified as direct primary pulmonary thrombosis (PPT) from the patient's injury. All were diagnosed with a 'PE' within 48 hours of admission, had DVT and the thrombosis correlated with the location and severity of their chest trauma. All thrombi were in small segmental pulmonary arteries. Group 3: 19 patients (29%) had no high risk injuries and were not considered for filter placement, yet failed routine VTE prophylaxis. Most had prolonged immobilization, multiple surgeries or other risk factors. Group 4: 6 patients (9%) represent PPT with no high risk injuries, no direct lung trauma, and no DVT. All had thrombosis of small segmental vessels and only sepsis as a common factor.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:VTE remains a significant contributor to the morbidity and mortality of the trauma patient. One fourth of radiographic diagnosed 'PE' (groups 2 and 4) can be classified as PPT and not emboli.These VTE events are likely in situ pulmonary arterial thrombosis secondary to the patient's injury itself or a result of hypercoagulability.Prospective studies of the natural history and treatment of PPT are needed.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

The regional trauma system aims to match the distribution and level of designated trauma centers to meet the needs of its population. Population demographics vary substantially across regions and predict variation in trauma center demographics. The purpose of this study was to characterize the variation in Florida trauma center patient populations. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A statewide discharge dataset was queried for all injury related discharges from Florida acute care hospitals using ICD-9 codes in 2014. Hospitals were categorized as non-trauma centers (NTC), Level 2 (DTC2), pediatric Level 2 (DTC2p), and Level I (DTC1) Designated trauma centers.  Elderly patients with isolated hip fractures from falls were excluded. ICISS values were calculated for all ages based on survival risk ratios of the adult (age 16-65) age group for the 5 years preceding the reported year. An ICISS &lt;0.85 defined high mortality risk and predicts &lt;85% survival. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 133710 injured patients discharged from 211 Florida acute care hospitals in 2014; 54,478 (41%) from one of 24 designated trauma centers including 10226 (80%) of 12771 high-risk patients. Individual trauma center volumes are shown in the figure. Although there was variability within each group, DTC1's as a group had a higher proportion of high risk patients (22%) compared to DTC2p (16%) and DTC2 (17%), lower proportion of elderly patients (26%) compared to DTC2p (42%) and DTC2 (43%), and a lower proportion of injuries resulting from falls (35%) compared to DTC2p (48%) and DTC2 (47%). Among the high risk patients, DTC1 treated a lower proportion of patients with Traumatic brain injuries (19%) compared to DTC2p (23) and DTC2 (28%).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Although all trauma centers may meet level specific standards and serve distinct populations, there is significant variability in populations served among Level 1 and Level 2 trauma centers and substantial overlap between some Level 1 and Level 2 centers.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the choice of operation undertaken in the management of renal injuries may not impact subsequent renal function. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for the development of AKI among trauma patients sustaining renal trauma.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We performed a 10-year retrospective cohort analysis of our level 1 trauma center database to identify patients admitted to the hospital for &gt;24 hours with a diagnosis of renal trauma. Grade of renal injury was determined using the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) kidney injury scale, whereas AKI was defined according to the RIFLE classification (both glomerular filtration rate and urine output criteria). The primary outcome measure was the development of AKI. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of kidney-related complications and mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of AKI.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Of 246 patients, 191 patients (78%) were managed non-operatively. Forty-three patients (17%) developed AKI (Risk, n=25; Injury, n=9; Failure, n=9), of which 7 (16%) required renal replacement therapy. Patients with AKI were older (35 vs. 28 years, p=0.03), more likely to present following a penetrating mechanism (p=0.02), and had a higher Injury Severity Score (26 vs. 20, p=0.02). There was an increased incidence of high-grade (IV/V) injuries among patients with AKI and these patients underwent nephrectomy more commonly (both p&lt;0.03). Kidney-related complications (26 vs. 8%, p=0.0003) and mortality (14 vs. 2%, p=0.001) were increased among patients with AKI. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, high-grade injuries (OR=3.3, 95% CI=1.3-8.4; p=0.015) and nephrectomy (OR=3.0, 95% CI=1.1-8.7; p=0.04) were independently associated with the development of AKI.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  AAST high-grade kidney injuries are associated with an increased risk for AKI as defined by the RIFLE criteria.

Less is known about hospital readmission in pediatric patients after an index admission for trauma care. In this study, we examine pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission as a risk factor for hospital readmission after trauma care.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  This is a retrospective cohort study of patients aged 1-19 years discharged with a trauma diagnosis from hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database between March, 2010, and February, 2015. Patients with inadequate clinical information, those transferred to the PICU after initial ward admission, and those who died after admission were excluded. Demographic patient variables included age, gender, payer status, and race/ethnicity. Clinical variables included length of stay, presence of mechanical ventilation, APR-DRG severity of illness (SOI), and disposition upon discharge. The main outcome variable was hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated in both univariate and multivariate analyses with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (C.I.).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: During the study period, 87,401 patients were admitted with a trauma diagnosis. Of these, 14,770 (16.9%) were admitted directly to the PICU. The overall population was 65.3% male and 62.4% white, and had an average age of 9.26 (SD 4.83) years. The most common payers were private (43.9%) and Medicaid (43.4%). Nearly half of the patients had a low SOI (49.3%). Most were discharged without home health services (96.1%). Hospital readmissions within 30 days occurred in 3.4% of patients. On univariate analysis, patients directly admitted to the PICU had more than twice the risk of 30-day hospital readmission compared to those never admitted to the PICU, 6.4% vs 2.8% (OR 2.36, C.I. 2.18-2.56). On multivariate analysis, controlling for demographic and clinical variables (excluding SOI), the OR for hospital readmission in patients initially admitted to the PICU was 1.45 (C.I. 1.32-1.59) compared to those never admitted to the PICU. When including SOI, the OR dropped to 1.11 (C.I. 1.002-1.228).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Direct admission to the PICU during an index hospitalization for trauma care is an independent risk factor for hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge. The majority of this effect is likely related to the patient's severity of illness. Further risk stratification may help appropriately focus resources on high risk patients in order to improve clinical outcomes and reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

We reviewed a single center's experience with these injuries to determine if the patterns of presentation have evolved from reported historical trends.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  All patients that sustained diaphragmatic injuries and presented to an American College of Surgeons verified Level I Trauma Center over an 8 year period (January 2004 &ndash; December 2011) were identified from the Trauma Registry.  Demographic data, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, laterality, method of diagnosis, length of stay, mortality and other data points were abstracted from the patient records. Comparisons where necessary were performed by Student t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and Fishers exact test for categorical ones.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:In the studied time period, there were 23,578 trauma admissions with 126 patients identified with diaphragmatic injuries. These represented 0.53% of all trauma admissions. The mean age was 37.0 years and 82% were male.   Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) - 40.5%, gunshot wounds - 36.5%, and stabbings - 11.1% were the most common etiologies of injury. Blunt mechanisms overall represented 50.8% with a mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 32.9. Penetrating mechanisms occurred in 49.2%. (mean ISS 21.5) Left-sided diaphragmatic injuries (65.9%) were more common than right sided (25.4%) and 7.9% were bilateral. Exploratory laparotomy was the most frequent method of diagnosis (45.2%). Chest X-ray (18.3%), CT (15.1%), Thoracotomy (6.3%) and Laparoscopy (4.8%) were the other diagnostic methods. Delayed diagnosis (&gt;12 hours) occurred in 14.5% of patients with 10.3% of these found at autopsy.  The overall mortality rate was 30.2%. Mortality was higher in blunt trauma - 40.6% vs. 19.4% in penetrating trauma. (p= 0.012) Patients who were stabbed had the lowest mortality rate (0%) while pedestrians trauma had the highest (80%). The laterality of the injury had no effect on mortality.  <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Diaphragmatic injuries are uncommon and can occasionally present a diagnostic challenge with delayed diagnosis &ndash;as seen in 14.5% of patients in this series. Left sided injuries predominate and mortality is higher with blunt trauma mechanisms &ndash; related to associated injuries. Exploratory laparotomy remains the most frequent method of diagnosis. Our findings are consistent with prior series in the literature with no major shifts in trends noted. Mechanisms due to penetrating injuries are higher in our study than has been historically reported.No optimal imaging diagnostic technique has emerged for diaphragmatic injuries and a high index of suspicion remains necessary to avoid delayed diagnoses and missed injuries.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

It created copious amounts of snowfall and crippled parts of Western New York, given the code name 'Snowvember'. We describe the relationship between this snow blizzard and emergency hospital admissions for falls and motor vehicle related injuries in Western New York. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We obtained data on adult trauma patients with ICD-9 codes for external causes of injury (E880-888, E810-819, and E820-825) over a period of one month (Nov 13-Dec 12) in 2013 and 2014 from our trauma registry.  The data was analyzed after the removal of identifiers.  <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Figure 1 shows snowfalls in Western NY in 2014 and 2013. The number of admission in 2014 for falls from height and MVA was double what it was in 2013 (110 vs 61) and MVC (78 vs 41).  There was no difference in male percentage and age.   The ISS was lower (6.5 vs 9.0, p&lt;0.01) for falls, but higher for MVA (59 vs 50, p&lt;0.05) in 2014 than in 2013 (Table).  The hospital LOC was shorter in 2014 than 2013 for patients sustaining falls (p&lt;0.05). The most common cause of MVA in 2014 was due to loss of control without collision on the highway (E-code 816). Furthermore, the percentage of this cause was significantly higher in 2014 than in 2013 (29.5% vs 10%, &chi;2 p=0.015).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our study demonstrates that this epic snowstorm in Western New York significantly increased the hospital admission for falls from height and MVA.  Although the State government imposed a driving ban during this snowstorm, hospital admission for and the ISS of motor vehicle related injuries were significantly higher, with a higher proportion being due to loss of control of the vehicles.  To prevent similar unnecessary injuries during snowstorms in the future, a public service campaign and media reports to advise the public on the risks of injury is advisable.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

The survey was administered to patients in a kidney transplant clinic. Following consent, the patient was provided with an iPad to complete the survey. Standard descriptive and comparative statistics were utilized for data analysis.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Between May and July 2015, a total of 139 kidney transplant recipients participated in the survey. The results indicate that 96% (129/135) of respondents own a mobile phone, 61% (82/135) own a smartphone, 30% (40/135) had prior knowledge of mHealth and 7% (10/135) were already using a mHealth app. The majority of respondents (78%, 105/135), reported a positive attitude toward the use of mHealth for medication management. Smartphone ownership has increased over the past three years (61%, 82/135 vs. 35%, 35/99; p=0.0002) and smartphone owners were more likely to strongly agree with the use of mHealth (52%, 43/82 vs. 43%, 23/53; p=0.006).

LA was performed in 44% of KTR and 55% of NTP. KT centers performed 49.6%(663) and non-KT centers performed 50.4%(673) appendectomies on KTR. Although the overall rate of complications in KTR was significantly higher than in NTP undergoing OA (22.2% vs 14.8%), they were similar for LA (10.6% vs 8.7%). Compared to NTP, KTR were not at greater risk of complications overall (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.65-1.37). However, they were more likely to have infectious (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.00-3.31) or wound (OR 3.25, 95% CI: 1.41-7.48) complications. Median LOS was longer in KTR regardless of surgical approach (KTR: 3 days for LA vs 4 days for OA; NTP: 2 days for LA vs 3 days for OA). Median hospital costs were higher for KTR for both LA and OA ($8600 and $9900 for KTR vs $7100 and $6300 for NTP). Transplant centers and non-transplant centers had similar complication rates (14.8% vs 19.2%), LOS (median 3 vs 3 days), and hospital charges ($6700 vs $6800) for KTR.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Though KTR are more likely to have an OA, they have better outcomes following LA and are comparable to NTP.  This suggests that when indicated and technically feasible, LA should be favored. KTR have a longer LOS and higher hospital charge regardless of surgical approach or type of center. Outcomes do not differ significantly between transplant and non-transplant centers suggesting it is safe to perform appendectomy on KTR at either type of center.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Brayman<sup>1</sup>, A. Agarwal<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>University Of Virginia,Charlottesville, VA, Virgin Islands, U.S.","<strong>Introduction</strong>: Modern induction immunosuppression protocols for renal transplantation balance the risks of over-immunosuppression, namely drug toxicity and infection, against graft rejection. There is limited literature on induction therapy optimization with polyclonal antibodies in the elderly population (&ge; 65 years). Rising health care costs and fixed payment are pressuring transplant programs to balance quality and fiscal management. Beyond the surgery, medications such as anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) are the largest expense in transplantation. The aim of this study is to evaluate graft outcomes and associated cost savings of reduced immunosuppression in elderly renal transplant patients as part of a risk stratified immunosuppression protocol. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a retrospective cohort study of elderly patients undergoing solitary renal transplants from 2011 to 2014. Risk-stratification (RS) was based on immunological risk (sensitization and age) with varying ATG dosing utilizing adjusted body weight as opposed to total body weight. All patients were maintained on tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisone. MMF target dosage was reduced from 2 g/day to 1.5 g/day. Patient (PS) and graft survival (GS), acute rejection (AR), total dosage (TD) and ATG cost are reported. Univariate analysis was performed and p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:21 elderly patients underwent transplantation: 4 in the historical (HT) and 17 in the RS group.  Mean follow up was 34&plusmn;3 months in the HT and 23&plusmn;8 months in the RS group. One year patient and graft survival were comparable (HT: 100 vs. RS: 100%; p=ns). Demographics were similar between groups, including mean age (67&plusmn;2 years vs. 69&plusmn;1; p=ns), % patients undergoing living donor transplants (0 vs. 6%; p=ns) and % patients with delayed graft function (25% vs. 31% p=ns). The HT group received two-fold total ATG dosage per patient vs. the RS group (450&plusmn;92 mg (5.3 mg/kg) vs. 209&plusmn;57 mg (2.6 mg/kg), p&lt;0.05). MMF dosage was reduced in RS by 30% (1875&plusmn;216 mg/day vs. 1312&plusmn;258 mg/day; p=0.01). Renal function, as determined by eGFR, remained excellent at 3 and 6 months (52&plusmn;13 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> vs. 65&plusmn;23; 46&plusmn;16 vs. 62&plusmn;21; p=ns). Acute cellular and humoral rejection was similar between groups at 6 months (25% vs. 6% p=ns; and 0%vs. 12%; p=ns). Overall 6 month infection rates were similar between cohorts (75% vs. 58%) with urinary tract infections as most common infection. The 53% reduction of ATG use in the RS cohort translated to a savings of $5825 per patient.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:The data would suggest that future modifications with immune monitoring could allow further optimization of immunosuppression. These data demonstrate that an individualized approach to immunosuppression with reduced dose ATG appears to maintain excellent clinical outcomes with low rejection rates and improved value of care with quantifiable cost savings.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Intraoperative hemodialysis (IOHD) has been utilized to aid these patients undergoing LT.  We sought to analyze outcomes after LT for patients requiring IOHD.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective analysis from our prospective database of 82 adult LTs between October 2012 and August 2015.  The median follow up was 12 months.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Among those 82 LTs, 37 (45.1%) patients had a MELD score &gt; 35.  Thirty-three patients had pre-LT renal dysfunction: 25 (76%) underwent IOHD (Grp I) and 8 (24%) did not (Grp II). Hepatitis C and alcohol were the commonest etiologies for liver failure.  While the mean MELD scores were comparable between groups I (43 + 5) and II (41 + 5), patients in Grp I were acutely ill compared to Grp II: there was a higher need for ICU management and urgent HD prior to LT (96% in Grp I versus 50% in Grp II, p=0.002), and an increased requirement for immediate post-transplant HD (92% in Grp I versus 50% in Grp II, p=0.007).  In Grp I, 48% received a combined liver-kidney transplant (CLK) compared to 87.5% in Grp II, p=0.04.  Among those who are alive at 3 months posttransplant, the HD-free recovery of renal function was 100% in Grp I and 75% in Grp II, p= 0.018.  The organ preservation ischemic times and intraoperative blood transfusion requirement were comparable for both groups.  There was a trend towards a lower intraoperative post-liver reperfusion hemodynamic instability in Grp I (16%) versus Grp II (37.5%), p=0.19.

We gathered pre and post transplant data and conducted univariant and multivariant analysis to assess variables predicting HCC recurrence after OLT.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Between 2003 and 2015, 141 patients underwent OLT for HCC at our institution.  We identified 9 cases of documented HCC recurrence (6.4% of patients).  Univariant analysis indicated that the mean serum alphafetoprotein (AFP) difference (maximum pretransplant value minus most recent prior to transplant value) was significantly lower in the HCC recurrence group (157.7 vs 0.64; p=0.018), as well as the mean maximum pre-transplant cholesterol (162.9 vs 119.3; p=0.038), and mean days between HCC treatment initiation and transplantation (146.9 vs. 37.9; p=0.025).  Maximum tumor size was larger in the HCC recurrence group (3.1 vs. 2.2 cm; p=0.14) as well.

The impact of MELD in predicting post liver transplant outcomes has been criticized. Several better predictive scoring systems using donor and recipient data have been developed. The aim of this study is to assess how donor quality impacts the outcomes of  liver transplant recipients with a MELD &gt;35 or acute liver failure (Status 1a) under the current allocation system.Materials and Methods This is a retrospective IRB approved study, of adult patients with MELD &gt;35 or Status 1a who received LT from 7/2006 to 7/2015 were included. We excluded pediatric transplant and living donor recipients. Recipient demographics, etiology, previous transplant, combined liver-kidney transplant, quality of donor were analyzed. ECD donors were defined as age &gt;65yrs, BMI &gt;35, HBcAb positive, HCV seropositive, DCD (donation after circulatory death), split liver, CIT (Cold Ischemia Time) &gt;12 hrs, Total Bilirubin &gt;2mg/dl, and/or requirement of more than 2 vasopressors. Survival rates in recipients transplanted with high-risk donors (ECD) and standard criteria donors (SCD) were compared using the Kaplan-Meier methods.Results 56 patients with MELD &gt;35 received LT during the study period (35 male and 21 female). Mean age was 51 years. 11 (19.6%) patients had acute liver failure (ALF)  and 20 (35.7%) were in ICU at time of transplant.  Six (10.7%) patients needed ventilator support. Ten of the 56 (17.8%) patients received combined liver-kidney transplants (CLKT) and Three patients had previous LT.Mean MELD for patients with chronic liver disease was 41.4. Most common indication was HCV(37.5%) followed by ETOH (16.07%). In ALF cases, 1 (9.2%) had HBV related, 4 (36.3%) had drug induced, and 6 (54.5%) were unknown etiology. Seventeen (30.3%) patients were transplanted with ECD grafts. Patient survival at 90 days was equal in both ECD and SCD groups (93% and 97% ns). There was no statistical significance between SCD and ECD groups in terms of 1 and 3 year patient survival (85.7% and 57.1% in ECD vs 76.4% and 56.8% SCD. (p=0.661)Conclusions Donor organ quality does not seem to play a role in early patient survival after LT, although patients with MELD &gt;35 may have worse long-term survival. Our analysis showed no significant difference when we use marginal or standard donors for high MELD or Status 1 recipients. This fact suggests that recipients with high MELD scores or fulminant liver failure may benefit from this pool of grafts. Accepting well selected ECD livers and having timely LT may result in better patient outcomes rather than waiting SCD for a longer period; however, long-term outcomes need to be considered.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Severity of illness has been shown to increase LOS in this population.  We examined how severity of illness at time of transplantation as demonstrated by medical condition at the time of transplant affected overall, pre-transplant and post-transplant length of stay (LOS) in the pediatric liver transplant population at a single center.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  We examined outcome in all pediatric patients who underwent liver transplantation between January 2010 and July 2014. Recipient and donor demographic data, and outcome data were examined. Demographic and outcome data included age, race, sex, weight, blood type, cold storage time (CST, time from donor aortic cross clamp to out of ice) in minutes, anastomotic time in minutes, estimated blood loss (EBL) at transplant, intraoperative transfusion requirement, presence and number of rejections, graft survival, liver disease, total LOS, medical condition at time of transplant (admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), to the ward, or coming from home), pre-transplant LOS, and post-transplant LOS. Categorical differences were compared using the unpaired Student&#39;s t-test and nominal variables using either the Chi Square or the Fischer&#39;s exact test. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Forty-six pediatric patients underwent liver transplantation. The recipient age in months at transplantation was 62.7+/-59.5 months, weight was 20.2+/-15.5 kg, CST was 432+/-98 minutes, anastomotic time was 57+/-17 minutes, EBL was 399+/-501 mL, intraoperative transfusion requirement was 360+/-371 mL, donor age was 89.5+/-115 months, and donor weight was 26.3+/-20.7 kg.

The average pre-transplant LOS in the ICU, ward, and home groups were 13.3+/-7.8, 14.8+/-11.7, and 0.7+/-0.5 days respectively.  The overall LOS and pre-transplant LOS were significantly longer in the ICU and ward groups compared to the home group (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively).  The post-transplant LOS was 18.5+/-10.5, 14.2+/-4.1, and 19.6+/-11.1 days for the ICU, ward, and home groups (p=NS).  There was also no significant difference between the etiology of liver disease and LOS.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients who had increased severity of illness had an increased overall length of stay.  The length of stay pre-transplant did not differ significantly between the ICU and ward groups.  Despite the ICU and ward patients being more ill pre-transplant, this did not translate into a longer post-transplant length of stay.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Immunonutrition, such as vitamins and amino acids, act to increase immunity, decrease inflammation, and decrease oxidative stress. This meta-analysis examines the impact of immunonutrition on the incidence of GVHD and post-operative infections among transplant recipients.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A comprehensive literature search for all published randomized control trials (RCTs) was conducted using Pubmed, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar (1966-2015).

Readmission was defined as hospitalization within 90 days of discharge. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of readmission and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate overall survival. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Over the 10-year study period, 325 patients underwent LT with an overall 90-day readmission rate of 46%.  Upon multivariable analysis, independent predictors of readmission were age at transplant (OR 0.97[0.94-1] per year), male gender (OR 0.48[0.26-0.88]), hospital length of stay after LT (OR 1.03[1-1.05] per day), hepatitis C as a primary cause of liver failure (OR 2.33[1.40-3.86]), and death (OR 2.19[1.18-4.09]). On overall survival analysis, readmitted patients were noted to have a significantly lower survival compared to those who were not readmitted (p=0.008 on log-rank test, Figure 1) with five-year survival being 74% vs. 88%, respectively. Of those readmitted, only one patient (2.5%) died at the time of initial readmission.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:LT recipients are at substantial risk for readmission with nearly half of all patients re-presenting within 90 days of discharge. As readmission is associated with decreased long-term survival, an emphasis should be placed on optimizing those at increased risk prior to discharge.  Furthermore, if readmission does occur, it appears to present an opportunity to intervene, as virtually no patients died during initial readmission.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Inconsistencies in information delivery during patient discharge is generally blamed for high number of 30-day readmissions among kidney transplant recipients. A standardized discharge process comprises activities that have clearly defined content, sequence, timing and outcome. In this research, a new standardized discharge process was developed through the participation of nurses performing discharge planning in five structured workshops, and supplemented with inputs from patients. We collect and analyze pre- and post- process standardization patient data to understand the efficacy of the new discharge process.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: This is a three year study and we are currently in year 2. In year 1, we collected pre-intervention data (qualitative and quantitative) from over 100 kidney transplant recipients at a major kidney transplant center in the United States. In addition, we shadowed nurses during the delivery of discharge instructions and collected data on their job satisfaction. In Year 2, we conducted five structured workshops involving inpatient and outpatient nurses (with inputs from patients) to design and develop a standardized discharge process. We also standardized various teaching aids, IT systems and patient-books to reflect the newly developed standards. These new standards were adopted starting July 27, 2015. At this time, we also initiated continuous improvement activities (using morning huddles) in these units to discuss the implementation and further improvement of discharge procedures. In year 3, we will collect patient data on readmissions and quality of life upon discharge as well as data from nurses on their quality of work. Comparisons will be made with the pre-intervention data. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Preliminary results using pre-intervention data from 100 patients indicate that patient anxiety one week following discharge strongly predicts the occurrence of readmissions. Readmission rates prior to our intervention were approximately 27%. Specifically, the odds of getting readmitted increase by 38% for a one unit increase in anxiety levels of the patient after discharge. We also found that patient anxiety levels primarily depend on both having a standardized discharge process and empathy shown during their hospital stay. We are in the process of collecting patient and caregiver data after implementation of the new standardized discharge process. We expect that patient anxiety levels, readmissions, and caregiver job satisfaction will show improvements as a result of the intervention. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our study aims to result in an efficient, patient-centric discharge process that will improve kidney transplant patient discharge experiences and higher compliance with discharge instructions resulting in reduced readmissions.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

Patients with high MELD scores are often considered too sick for LDLT while those with low MELD scores may be considered 'too early'.  We compared characteristics of LDLT recipients with those patients without LDs who died on the waiting list during the same time period.  The purpose of the study was to determine if patients with end-stage liver disease and availability of a LD are less likely to die on the waitlist.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Demographic and clinical data of patients who received LDLT (LD) or who died on the waitlist (DOW) between 2002 and 2013 were compared.  Statistical analysis was performed sing SPSS; p values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 204 LDLT recipients and 198 patients who DOW were identified. Both groups were male predominant (72% LD vs. 62% DOW) and had similar MELD scores at evaluation (14.1+6.0 LD vs.15.7+6.5 DOW).  Patients who died while waiting had lower platelet counts (105 vs. 149 LD, p=0.009) and albumin (2.6 vs. 3.2 LD, p=0.01) at evaluation and higher incidence of SBP (43.3% vs. 26.9% LD, p=0.001) than patients with LD. Their MELD at death was 24.9+12.9 vs. 14.8+6.0 at LDLT (p=0.001).  Mean platelet count at death was 70.1 vs.136 at LDLT (p=0.002).Additional comparisons are shown in Table 1. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patient with an available LD are referred, listed and transplanted significantly earlier that those waiting for a deceased donor.  Despite similar initial MELD scores, patients with LD were transplanted with improved nutritional status, less portal hypertension, fewer decompensating events such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and were less likely to be temporarily inactivated.

Maluccio<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Indiana University School Of Medicine,Surgery/Tranplant,Indianapolis, IN, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: The absolute impact of given a given treatment for cancer is measured by how long a patient lives compared to their expected survival. For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), life expectancy is often determined by the combination of liver related and tumor related variables. The Cancer of the Liver Italian Program Investigators (CLIP) score is one validated measure of survival in patients with HCC and has been used to assess disease free and overall survival in a large cohort of patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of transplantation on survival of HCC patients by comparing preoperative CLIP score estimates of life expectancy to post transplant survival. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Records from a database of 1572 consecutive adult liver transplants performed at Indiana University between July 2001 and June 2015 were reviewed. Of these patients, 376 had HCC. CLIP scores were calculated for all patients, and patients were stratified by scores 0-1 (low risk), 2 (intermediate risk), and 3-4 (high risk). Life expectancy was estimated based on published survival rates for each CLIP score category. Post transplant survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The absolute survival benefit for each group was evaluated by comparing the average survival of all patients in each group compared to the estimated survival by CLIP score analysis. <br><br><strong>Results</strong>:The mean death-censored follow up for the entire population was 61 months from the date of transplant. The median survival has not yet been met. The mean actuarial survival was: 112 months, 108 months, and 77 months for CLIP 0-1, 2, and 3-4 respectively. This was compared to pre-transplant life expectancies of 38 months, 17 months, and 4 months, respectively. Therefore, for the three study groups, survival is increased by a minimum of 74, 91, and 73 months, respectively. 10 year survival is shown in the figure.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Liver transplantation prolongs survival in the vast majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma compared to pre-transplant survival estimates. For the individual cancer patient with HCC, transplantation is the most promising treatment currently available.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Transplantation"

These factors are believed to play a major role in promoting T-lymphocyte growth and replication, modulating cytokines to produce less inflammatory and immunosuppressive mediators, and providing a source of purine and pyrimidine bases for DNA/RNA production. We sought to evaluate outcomes associated with utilizing enteral IMPACT<sup>&reg;</sup> for patients undergoing pancreatectomies.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Retrospectively collected data on pancreatectomy patients who received IMPACT<sup>&reg;</sup> preoperatively for 5 days (3 cans/d) was analyzed and compared to pancreatectomy cases in our institutional NSQIP database who did not receive IMPACT<sup>&reg;</sup>. Data collection included demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status, rates of 30-day postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) and length of hospital stay (LOS). IMPACT<sup>&reg;</sup> patients without NSQIP data had data on postoperative complications validated from chart reviews using NSQIP definitions.  Outcomes were compared between groups.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 26 patients who received IMPACT<sup>&reg;</sup> were evaluated and compared to 348 patients who did not receive the formula. There was no difference in gender distribution (p=0.07), race (p=0.06), median age (0.06) or ASA status (p=0.8) between groups. On univariable analysis, there was no difference between rates of postoperative 30-day SSI in the IMPACT<sup>&reg;</sup> group (0% vs 11%, p=0.09) or median LOS (7.5 (2-22) days vs 7 (2-57) days, p=0.2) (Table 1).

The purpose of the current study was to examine an institutional experience with well-differentiated, non-functional, non-ampullary dNETs and identify factors to help guide appropriate evaluation and management.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of dNET from 1993-2015, excluding those with hormonally functional or ampullary tumors. Clinical data was obtained from medical records and evaluated to identify predictors of regional lymph node(LN) metastases. Tumor grade was determined by Ki-67 index according to WHO definitions(G1&le;2%; G2 3-20%). Regional lymph node dissection(RLND) was defined as an anatomic operation that included hepatoduodenal, peri-pancreatic, and hepatic arterial LNs.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:During the study period, 36 patients were identified with a diagnosis of well-differentiated, non-functional, non-ampullary dNET. Resection was performed via surgery in 28 patients and endoscopy in 8. Operations included antrectomy(15), partial duodenectomy(6), transduodenal submucosal resection(4), and pancreaticoduodenectomy(3). Eight patients underwent formal RLND as part of their operation, yielding a median of 8(5-12) LNs vs 3(1-6) in those in whom LNs were sampled incidentally(p=0.003). Depth of tumor invasion was evaluable in 33 patients and involved the mucosa in 4(12%), submucosa in 22(67%), and muscularis propria in 7(21%).  Ki-67 index was evaluable in 30 patients, revealing G1 tumors in 20(67%) and G2 in 10(33%).  LNs were included in the specimen in 19/28(68%) with LN metastases identified in 5/19(26%). Of those with LN metastases, all had tumors &le;2cm and there was no significant difference in tumor size between LN+ and LN- patients(1.4cm vs 1.0cm, p=0.13). When compared to patients with no LN involvement, those with positive LNs were more likely to have muscularis propria invasion(80% vs 23%, p=0.04) and have undergone formal RLND(80% vs 31%, p=0.03). Among LN+ patients, 40% had G2 tumors vs 50% in LN- pts(p=0.99). Of LN+ patients, suspicious LNs were identified on preoperative CT in 40%. Preoperative EUS was not performed in any LN+ patients, however, when utilized was found to have 100% accuracy in predicting tumor depth of invasion.  No patients were found to have distant metastases. At a mean follow up of 28 months, no patient developed recurrence or experienced disease-specific death.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Non-functional, non-ampullary dNETs have a propensity to metastasize to regional LNs. Although preoperative CT and EUS may assist in treatment planning, tumor size and grade were not predictive of LN involvement. Therefore, performance of an anatomic RLND at the time of resection likely results in more accurate disease staging. Longer follow up is necessary to further evaluate the prognostic impact of LN+ disease and therapeutic benefit of RLND.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Multiple studies have shown that individuals with cancer that are under insured have worse outcomes.  However, to the best of our knowledge outcomes in the uninsured and underinsured undergoing CRS-HIPEC have not been investigated.  Therefore, we looked at the outcomes in our series of CRS-HIPEC patients stratified by insurance status to see whether these individuals suffer worse outcomes. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Demographics, comorbidities, intraoperative variables, and post-operative outcomes for all patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC at a single institution from 2012 to 2015 were analyzed.  Variables were examined with chi squared or Wilcoxon Ranked Sum Test where appropriate.  Survival was analyzed with Kaplan Meier curves and Cox Proportional Hazard Regressions.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:During this time frame, 27 individuals underwent CRS-HIPEC.  Sixteen of these individuals were underinsured (either Charity Care or Medicaid) while 11 were insured (Medicare or private insurance).  The median age of the underinsured group was significant lower than that of the insured group (54.1 years vs 62.3 years, p=0.02).  The groups had similar distributions of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (0 vs 0, p=0.86) and peritoneal carcinoma index (25.5 vs 18, p=0.42).  The under insured group had a higher preoperative albumin levels (4.0 vs 3.3, p=0.04).  Both groups had similar distribution and total number of organs resected (3.5 vs 4 total organs, p=1.00).  Operative time trended to being longer in the under insured group (573.5 minutes vs 510 minutes, p=0.06).  Both groups had similar rate of major complications (Clavien Dindo complication of 3A or greater, 64.3% vs 63.6%, p=0.97) and length of stay (12 vs 11 days, p=0.98).  Median follow up time for the under insured group was 8.5 months while the median follow up for the insured group was 1.7 months.  During the follow up, 4 individuals in each group died; at 44, 71, 73, and 733 days within the under insured group the deaths occurred and at 16, 40, 41, and 72 days within the insured group.  Survival was significantly better within the under insured group (p=0.02).  After controlling for age and preoperative albumin, the survival difference remained significant improved within the under insured group (HR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.76, p=0.04).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:In this small, single center study with very short follow up, there was an improvement in survival for those underinsured undergoing CRS-HIPEC and no difference in length of stay or complications.

Current ASCO and NCCN guidelines recommend against the routine use of biomarkers or advanced imaging for asymptomatic patients.  These guidelines do not account for heterogeneity in individual patient risk or the significant advances in imaging and treatments that have been made since the studies on which these guidelines are based were conducted.  As a result, utilization remains high.  We performed a systematic review to assess recent evidence supporting surveillance with biomarkers or advanced body imaging for detection of distant recurrence after treatment for breast cancer.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: A systematic search was conducted in March 2015 using MEDLINE(PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials for articles on breast cancer, diagnostic imaging, recurrence, and surveillance, and their word variants.  After the removal of duplicates, a total of 2887 results were screened.  Studies were excluded if conducted for screening/staging primary breast cancer, if patients had not been treated with curative intent, if patients were symptomatic, or if the study was conducted prior to the year 2000.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Twenty nine studies met the inclusion criteria.  Twenty three studies documented utilization of routine biomarkers and imaging for asymptomatic surveillance.  Only two studies compared surveillance with guideline concordant care (clinical visits and mammography) with a more intensive protocol involving advanced imaging.  The majority of studies used cross-sectional imaging and biomarkers as the comparison group despite recommendations against them.  Nineteen studies evaluated the use of PET/CT in detecting recurrence compared to other cross sectional imaging in the setting of rising tumor markers (CA 15-3, CEA).  There was no overall or disease-free survival benefits in any study.  PET/CT demonstrated a consistently higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting distant recurrence compared to biomarkers and/or conventional imaging alone.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Our review found that current research mostly focused on investigating newer surveillance modalities, such as PET/CT, rather than generating evidence for or against current recommended guidelines.  These studies suggest that although PET/CT is more accurate in detecting distant recurrence than other modalities, surveillance using advanced imaging or biomarkers did not yield significant improvements in survival for the post-treatment population.  Because these studies did not consider patient risk factors or molecular subtypes, the question of whether surveillance using biomarkers or cross-sectional imaging might be valuable for subpopulations remains unanswered.  Until evidence accounting for patient heterogeneity is generated, use of biomarkers and advanced imaging for asymptomatic surveillance among breast cancer survivors is likely to continue despite guidelines discouraging their use.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

Although the incidence of breast cancer is lower among Black women than among White women, mortality remains higher among Black women. Biological tumor characteristics such as grade at diagnosis and hormone receptor status have been implicated in this disparity. This study intends to evaluate the outcomes of surgical interventions for invasive breast carcinoma.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Conducted a retrospective review of a single institution's breast cancer registry from 1990 to 2013. Data collected included demographics, histological grade, stage, hormone receptor status, therapeutic interventions, recurrence, and survival. Patients with diagnosis of infiltrating carcinoma, who were reported as Black, who were female, and for whom date of diagnosis was before 8/19/2009. The primary outcomes evaluated were five year survival (5YS) and five year disease-free survival (DFS). Group comparisons were conducted between patients who received breast conserving therapy (BCT: lumpectomy, partial mastectomy) and those who received a form of mastectomy (total/simple, radical, or modified radical). T tests were used to evaluate continuous variables, and Pearson's chi-square test to evaluate categorical variables.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 1164 patients met inclusion criteria. Of those, the mean age at diagnosis was 57.7. 94.4% (1099) had the primary diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma. 73.7% had surgical treatment, 59.4% had BCT, and 40.6% had mastectomy. 6.5% had tumor evaluated as grade I; 24.7% grade II; 50.9% grade III; 0.6% grade IV. 26.3% were stage 1 at biopsy; 38.0% stage 2; 14.8% stage 3; 2.1% stage 4. Hormone receptor status was evaluated for 531 patients; 64.2% (341) were estrogen receptor (ER) positive; 47.6% were progesterone receptor (PR) positive; 44.8% were both ER and PR positive. 380 patients had unequivocal determination of HER2NEU status: 19.7% (75) were HER2NEU positive. Of the entire cohort, 2.0% were triple positive; 8.4% were ER and PR positive, HER2NEU negative; 8.9% were triple negative. Of the patients who were ER positive, 52.3% (181) had 5YS (P&lt;0.05); 55.5% (137) PR positive patients had 5YS (P&lt;0.001); 60.2% (59) patients who were ER and PR positive, HER2NEU negative had 5YS (P&lt;0.05). 63.9% (324) of patients who underwent BCT had 5YS; 48.9% (216) of patients who underwent some form of mastectomy had 5YS.

The elderly are a rapidly increasing proportion of the population and account for a disproportionate number of trauma deaths. Elderly patients with injuries stay in the hospital twice as long as younger patients with similar injuries and are twice as likely to die. Previous studies have analyzed the temporal distribution of all trauma-related deaths, but none have focused specifically on the elderly, a growing segment of the population. The objective of our study was to evaluate and compare time to death in elderly and younger trauma patient populations. We hypothesized that the elderly would survive the initial injury but display an increase in delayed deaths in comparison to the young.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a retrospective review of adult trauma deaths over 5 years at at our Level I trauma center (1/2010-12/2014). We reviewed trauma registry data, Morbidity &amp; Mortality reports and electronic medical records, and categorized patients as elderly (&ge; 55 years) and young (16-54 years). The rate of mortality in each group was calculated and Injury Severity Scores (ISS) scores compared. The log-rank test was used to compare variables between the two populations, with significance set at p&lt;0.05.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:There were 27,977 admissions and 1,373 trauma deaths over the five-year period.

Adults who underwent a partial or total colorectal resection with an ileo-colonic, colo-colonic, colo-rectal, ileo-rectal, colo-anal or ileo-anal anastomosis, between 2002 and 2012 were eligible for inclusion in the sample.  Our cohort was composed of 537 procedures performed on 510 patients.  Logistic regression using backward elimination was used to identify predictors of an AL.  Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for AL, 95% confidence intervals (CI), and P values were calculated assuming statistical independence.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: The overall AL rate was 10.4%. Of the 510 patients, 88% were of Hispanic ethnicity.  37.5% of the patients who experienced AL and 25.0% of those who did not, were diabetic (P=0.04). The final regression equation contained two predictors: diabetic status and the type of resection. Diabetics were more likely to experience AL: adjusted OR=1.97 (95% CI: 1.07-3.63, P=0.03).  Patients whose type of resection was colo-anal vs. ileo-colonic were more likely to develop an AL:  adjusted OR=4.85, 95% CI: 1.33-17.69, P=0.02).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Diabetes and colo-anal anastomosis are associated with a higher risk of AL and should be considered and evaluated in the pre-operative surgical planning.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"General Surgery"

For this reason, it is felt that there is an increased risk of post-operative complications with rectal resections compared to only colon resections.  The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of patients who underwent rectal resections versus colon resections.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Review of the Carolinas Medical Center (CMC) NSQIP data for colorectal resections performed from 2013 to 2015 was conducted.  Procedures were categorized as rectal vs colon based on CPT codes.  Demographics, pre-operative co-morbidities, minor and major complications were evaluated using standard statistical methods.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 637 patients in the sample; 219 patients underwent rectal resections and 418 colon resections.  Patients undergoing rectal resections were younger (58.9&plusmn;12.2 vs 61.7&plusmn;15; p=0.001) with no differences in BMI, gender or race.  Those undergoing rectal resections had lower rates of diabetes (11.4% vs 19.4%; p=0.04), COPD (3.2% vs 7.9%; p=0.02), and fewer emergent cases (3.6% vs 15.8%; p&lt;0.001).  Pre-operatively, they had lower ventilator use (1.4% vs 5%; p=0.03), transfusions (1.8% vs 8.8%; p&lt;0.001) and sepsis (2.3% vs 10.3%; p&lt;0.001).  Rectal resections were more often done laparoscopically (78.3% vs 59.6%; p&lt;0.001).  Post-operatively, those undergoing rectal resections had lower rates of pneumonia (PNA) (0.5 vs 2.9%; p=0.04), transfusions (12.3 vs 22%; p=0.003), sepsis (5% vs 10.5%; p=0.02), decreased 30 day mortality rate (1.4% vs 5.3%; p=0.02) and a shorter length of stay (8.7&plusmn;8.3d vs 10.2&plusmn;9.5d; p=0.02).  After controlling for pre-op ventilator use and COPD, multivariate analysis (MV) indicated no significant difference in post-op PNA between the 2 groups.  After controlling for pre-op transfusions and sepsis, MV analysis indicated no significant difference in post-op transfusions between the 2 groups.  After controlling for pre-op sepsis, emergent case status and ASA class, MV analysis indicated no significant differences in post-op sepsis, 30 day mortality or LOS between the 2 groups.  There were no significant differences in post-operative surgical site infections, deep infections, UTIs, cardiac or renal disease, DVTs/PEs, anastomotic leaks, unplanned returns to the OR, and death after 30 days between the 2 groups. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Patients undergoing rectal resections had fewer co-morbidities, underwent more laparoscopic and fewer emergent cases.  They had fewer post-operative complications upon initial review of the data, though after controlling for ASA, pre-op sepsis and transfusions, emergent status and COPD, there were no significant differences between the groups.

One specific area of intended improvement was post-operative surgical site infections (SSI).  The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes in colorectal patients who received antibiotics per SCIP guidelines versus those that did not.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A list of 44 patients at our institution where SCIP antibiotic measures were not followed between 2012-2014 was obtained.  Twelve of these patients were in our NSQIP database and we used the results from NSQIP to determine demographics, pre-op co-morbidities and post-op outcomes.  For the other 32 patients, a chart review was conducted to determine similar variables.  We also excluded any NSQIP patients with sepsis or dirty wounds as they met SCIP exclusion criteria.  Standard statistical methods were used to compare the data for the 44 non-compliant patients to the remaining SCIP-compliant patients in the NSQIP database.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: There were 563 patients in the sample and 44 did not receive antibiotics per SCIP guidelines.  Of these 44 patients, 3 did not receive SCIP appropriate pre-op dosing of antibiotics within 1 hour of incision, 25 did not receive the SCIP appropriate antibiotic and 16 were non-compliant with post-op antibiotic duration.  There were no significant differences between the groups in age, BMI, race, gender, hypertension, heart failure, ASA class, or ventilator use.  There were no significant differences in superficial SSI, deep incisional SSI, organ space infection, pneumonia, UTIs, DVT/PEs, MIs, post-op transfusions or sepsis, unplanned return to the OR, 30 day mortality or length of stay between the 2 groups.

Previous work by the Commission focused on estimating access to surgical care through geospatial mapping of surgical providers in nine countries (2). Given the general availability of information on hospital locations, we wished to use surgical facility location to determine the upper bound of a country's population with access to surgical care within two hours, and compare differences between a high-resource country (Sweden) and a low-resource one (Zambia).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   We gathered surgical facility data from Zambia's Ministry of Health List of Health Facilities in Zambia (3).  We included 1st, 2nd and 3rd level hospitals offering of surgical services in our analysis.  Surgical facilities in Sweden were identified from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and publicly available online resources (4). Google Maps Engine was used to locate the identified surgical facilities and to create two-hour driving zones around each location.  Finally, the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center Population Estimation Service was used to estimate the population living within each access zone (5).<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  We identified 77 hospitals in Sweden and 100 hospitals in Zambia, which provided general surgery care.  An estimated 99.52% of the Swedish population lives within two hours driving distance to a surgical facility, as compared to 74.28% of the Zambian population. Geographic size of these nations and road conditions and driving times influence these numbers.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Sweden and Zambia have disparate but high proportions of their population that live within two hours, driving distance, of a surgical facility. However, ease of transportation to these facilities, workforce availability and functionality, and affordability of surgical services will determine true access to surgical care. Nonetheless, knowledge of the distribution of surgical facilities in relation to population distribution is critical information for health systems planning. Geospatial mapping of surgical facilities should be used in conjunction with contextual differences in geography, seasonal variation in road quality, population access to vehicular transportation, and distribution of vulnerable populations to direct investments into new surgical facilities or to optimize existing ones.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

The impact of short-term surgical missions (STSM) on the delivery of surgical care to communities in LIC is largely unknown.  We sought to investigate the relative contributions of repeat STSM to the total surgical care delivery at a district hospital in eastern Ghana.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Retrospective review of case logs from two 10-day STSM sponsored by the International Surgical Health Initiative (ISHI) in September 2013 and August 2014 were compared to those from Tetteh Quarshie Memorial Hospital (TQMH) over the intervening months.  Data collected included age, sex, operation(s) performed, findings, type of anesthesia, and emergent cases.  Data presented as mean &plusmn; SD or percentage of total as appropriate; p&lt;0.05 considered significant.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Over this 1-year period, a total of 225 procedures were performed on 187 patients at TQMH.  ISHI teams performed 100 procedures on 94 patients and local teams performed 125 procedures on 93 patients.  ISHI teams operated on significantly more females, (47% vs. 31%; p= 0.028) and older patients (46&plusmn;17 vs. 40&plusmn;20 years; p = 0.027).  24% of cases undertaken by local surgeons involved multiple procedures, as compared to 6% of ISHI cases (p=0.0009).  Local teams performed 21 emergent operations (23%) as compared to 1 (1%) by ISHI team (p = 0.00005).  The three most common case types were inguinal hernia repair (45%), mass excision (22%), and ventral hernia repair (15%) for ISHI teams and inguinal hernia repair (39%), ventral hernia repair (12%), and appendectomy (10%) for local teams. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Repeat STSM to a district hospital can contribute about 50% of the surgical care provided to the local community.  While the types of cases performed by both teams were similar, the international team performed more surgeries on older patients and more women, whereas the local team performed more emergency and multi-procedure cases. While STSM may not permanently increase the capability of local practitioners to alleviate the surgical burden seen in LIC, they make a significant and immediate impact on these communities.  Long-term sustainable solutions are needed to support these surgical efforts, potentially doubling the surgical care delivery in rural communities and allowing for the dissemination of surgical skills and knowledge.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Global Surgery"

However, there is hardly any data from prospective studies to objectively evaluate its role. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the outcomes of robotic assisted esophagectomy (RAE).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A systematic literature search was performed using Medline (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane and Scopus. Studies reporting on short and long-term clinical outcomes of RAE were reviewed. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, surgical outcomes such as operative time, blood loss, and post-operative complications and mortality were systematically collated. For comparative studies included, meta-analysis using random and fixed effect models was done by calculation of pooled relative risk with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Study quality was assessed using STROBE criteria.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Our search yielded a total of 17 studies, only two of those compared RAE with thoracoscopic technique. The studies included a total of 666 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent RAE from May 2006 to April 2015. Tumor histology was adenocarcinoma in 386 (58%), squamous cell carcinoma in 162 (24%) and other in 118 (18%). Review of all included data on RAE showed a median blood loss of 148 (R: 10-5300) ml, operative time of 410 (R: 120-807) minutes, length of hospital stay of 10.4 (R: 4-182) days, and ICU stay of 2 (R: 0-136). Median number of lymph nodes harvested was 20, (R: 3-68). 30 day mortality was (n=12, 1.8%). Complications included cardiac (0-42.9%), pulmonary (0-71.4%), vocal cord paralysis (0-37.5%), anastomotic leak (0-37.5%), wound infection (0-14.3%), and DVT/PE (0-9.5%). Meta-analysis of data from the two comparative studies showed significantly lower length of hospital stay (Mean Difference -12.7 days, 95% CI -21.1 to -4.3, p=0.003) and less operative time (Mean Difference -38.3, 95% CI -67.2 to -9.4, p=0.0095) in the RAE group. There was no difference in lymph node harvest between the two groups. Post-operative complications were less in RAE group, yet they did not reach statistical significance. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: RAE can be performed with comparable safety and oncologic outcomes to open and thoracoscopic techniques in patients with esophageal cancer. Prospective comparative studies are needed as surgeons advance on their learning curve for using this newly introduced technology, in order to accurately evaluate the long term therapeutic and economic value of this technique.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"

The most common method to biopsy a skin lesion is the shave biopsy (SB).  Shave biopsies are efficient and require no stitch therefore the preferred method to sample a lesion.  However, SB application requires proficient technique primarily utilized by dermatologists.  Additionally, the SB depth is subjective and uncertain at time of harvest.  Malignant melanoma depth of invasion (Breslow depth) is the primary determinate of prognosis and guides clinical management of this disease.  The decision point is 1mm depth of invasion measured from the stratum granulosum to determine the need for SLN biopsy and 1 vs. 2cm margin of excision.  The present study examines an innovative SB design that is user friendly and quantifies the depth of specimen harvest at the time tissue acquisition.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A depth quantified SB prototype was constructed on a 3-D printer from DurusWhite, a polypropylene material, and fitted with custom fabricated scalpel blade.  The depth of biopsy from the stratum corneum (surface of skin) was engineered to be at least 1.1mm.  Fresh cadeveric abdominal tissue SB samples were harvested and placed immediately in formalin after the depth margin was inked.  Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed with microscopic analysis to determine depth harvest consistency.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Five tissue samples were harvested and analyzed with light microscopy with the following depths from the stratum granulosom (greatest Breslow depths): 1.32, 1.48, 1.05, 1.42, and 1.10mm.  The average depth of specimen harvest was 1.27 mm (standard deviation 0.19mm).  The average specimen width where the depth was of at least 1.1 mm was 1.5mm (standard deviation 0.56mm).  No specimen harvest violated the entire thickness of dermis indicating a safe device that leaves a wound to heal via secondary intention (as is standard in conventional shave biopsy). <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our innovative SB prototype proved consistent specimen harvest beyond 1mm from the stratum granulosum as required for accurate biopsy interrogation of malignant melanoma.  Future studies will prove increased ease of use with direct controlled comparison to the conventional shave biopsy design.  Implementation by primary care doctors and midlevel providers is the ultimate goal in order to decrease waiting time to lesion biopsy and reduce overall healthcare cost, as many lesions biopsied are ultimately benign.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Plastics"

Perioperative outcomes of elderly patients who sustain open tibia fractures may be affected by a variety of factors including nutritional status, bone quality, comorbid conditions and gender.  Therefore, we aim to determine the 30 day perioperative complications associated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of open tibia fractures in the elderly.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) from 2007-2010 utilizing ICD-9 codes (823.10, 823.30, and 823.90) was conducted.  Cases &gt;18 years old, who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the tibia at a level I or level II trauma center were included.  Patients were then stratified by age into four groups, with those 18-24 years serving as the reference group and the elderly being those 65 years and older.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 9,331 open tibia fractures during the study period underwent ORIF, of which 7,201 cases met inclusion criteria.  The majority were white (67%), males (74%), between 25-44 years old (42%).  Patients with private insurance (23%) and injury via motor vehicle collisions (25%) were most common. Elderly patients comprised 9.3% of the total population of which 86% were White and 52% were male.  Elderly patients were 78% more likely to have fixation after hospital day 2 (OR: 1.78 CI: 1.52-32.08 p&lt;0.001), 2.5 times more likely to have a bleeding complication (OR: 2.5 CI: 1.13-5.54 p=0.024), and almost 5 times more likely to have cardiac arrest within 30 days (OR: 4.93 CI: 1.04-23.46 p=0.045).  Developing superficial (OR: 3.91 CI: 1.14-13.5 p=0.031), organ/space (OR: 1.75 CI: 1.19-2.59 p=0.005), or any surgical site infection (OR: 1.95 CI: 1.35-2.84 p&lt;0.001) were more likely in the elderly compared to those ages 18-24 years.  A greater proportion of the elderly developed systemic sepsis (&chi;<sup style=""line-height:1.6em"">2</sup>= 34.7 N = 9.95 p=0.019).  Elderly patients were 72% more likely to have at least one perioperative complication (OR: 1.72 CI: 1.27-2.35 p=0.001), and 26% more likely to have a longer length of stay (OR: 1.26 CI: 1.18-1.36 p&lt;0.001). Elderly patients were six times more likely to die (OR: 6.05 CI: 2.07-17.69 p&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Elderly patients represent a small proportion of isolated traumatic open tibia fracture cases with a slight majority being among elderly men.  There is a clear disparity in their preoperative surgical outcomes, having greater odds of developing perioperative infections or any complication.  Elderly patients who sustain open tibia fractures were subject to having the most profound perioperative complication of all; death.  This may be secondary to their markedly increased odds of perioperative cardiac arrest, which prolonged length of hospitalization.

With lower water levels in the lakes and rivers, a new mechanism of injury has emerged.  Patients are sustaining serious injuries and are doing so with a much higher incidence than previously seen.  Patients are presenting with injuries sustained while using rope swings in areas previously with safe water levels. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  Following IRB approval, a retrospective chart review of all admitted trauma patients seen following rope swing accidents during the summers (July to September) of 2013 and 2014 was performed.  Data collected included: demographics (age, gender), injury characteristics (ISS, types of injuries), outcomes (length of stay, surgical procedures), and discharge disposition.  Values are expressed as mean &plusmn; SD.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  During summer of 2013, only 2 patients presented with injuries following falls from rope swings.  In summer of 2014, 13 patients presented with injuries sustained while using rope swings.  This represented a 650% increase from the previous year.  The mean age of patients was 28.9&plusmn;14.2 (range 10-56) years.  Eight patients were women (61.5%).  Patients fell from a mean height of 14.3&plusmn;6.3 (6-25) feet. Only 2 patients (15.4%) had a loss of consciousness and all patients presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15.  The mean ISS was 9.17&plusmn;6.5 (1-25). These 13 patients sustained 22 injuries.  The most frequent injuries were: pelvic fractures (3 patients), lumbar spine fractures (3 patients) and concussions (2 patients).  They required a mean of 1&plusmn;0.96 (0-3) procedures.  The mean length of stay was 5.46&plusmn;4.0 (1-15) days and 11 patients (84.6%) were discharged home from the hospital.  One patient went to a skilled nursing facility and one patient left against medical advice.  Eight patients (61.5%) required durable medical equipment at the time of discharge.  One patient was readmitted for cellulitis.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  As the drought intensifies and water levels get lower, there has been a surge in patients presenting with injuries that were sustained using rope swings.  The patients are presenting with serious, potentially life-threatening injuries that often require surgical procedures and inpatient hospital stays.  Additionally the majority of these patients require durable medical equipment at discharge.  All of this produces significant societal cost.  The public must be made aware of the dangers of rope swings and those that are located in areas with severely low water levels or dangerous conditions should be removed.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

It has been suggested that trauma readmission is an indicator of poor hospital care or fragmented discharge. Even though readmissions are relatively low readmissions add significant cost, are resource intensive, tie up already limited resources and lead to worse outcomes, including mortality. Between 15 to 38% of trauma readmissions require an operation during readmission and are associated with a 4.6% mortality rate.The Affordable Care Act will penalize hospitals for unplanned readmissions. While this does not pertain to trauma patients currently, there is concern that in the future it will.  The 30 day rate of unplanned readmission in US Medicare patients is estimated to be 20% for both medical and surgical patients. The literature suggests that trauma patients have a lower readmission rate compared to medical and surgical patients. Further studies are needed to determine reasons for readmissions and risk factors that predispose patients to unplanned readmissions.  Once these have been elucidated efforts can be made to highlight patients who are at increased risk and enact strategies to reduce preventable readmissions. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   This is a retrospective review of trauma patients over the age of 16 with an unplanned readmission within 30 days of discharge.  Cases registered from July, 2012 to June, 2015 were included from our Level 1 trauma center registry.  Reasons for readmission were categorized and patient outcomes following readmission were evaluated as well as hospital resource usage.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  Of 5,650 patients, 159 (2.81%) required unplanned readmission. The most common reasons were disease/ symptom progression (30.2%), wound complications (28.9%), pain control (11.8%) and VTE disease (9.4%).  Missed injuries accounted for 3.1% of readmissions. 76 (48%) required a surgical or invasive procedure. 63% were readmitted within 1 week of initial discharge and 60.3% required less than 1 week LOS after readmission .  The mean LOS after readmission was 7 days. The mortality rate for those requiring readmission was 3.1%. <br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our trauma readmission incidence and readmission mortality rate is consistent with previously published studies. Given that the preponderance of these occur within 1 week after discharge, are for disease/symptom progression or pain control and require a hospital stay less than 7 days trauma programs should use their quality management programs to identify system improvements to reduce these types of readmissions. This will benefit both patients and hospitals.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Injury mechanisms can be separated into individual events (e.g. falls) or interaction events (e.g. motor-vehicle accidents). Interaction events occur between individuals and are expected to be higher amongst regions with higher population density. We aimed to see whether collisions mechanisms in Florida counties increased with population density.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Data for this retrospective cohort study were obtained from the 2013 Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration (AHCA) discharge database. All patients with trauma alert charges or admission type defined as trauma were included. Additionally, any admissions classified as urgent or emergent with any ICD-9 codes between 800 and 957 were included. Patients were excluded if they were pronounced dead on arrival. County populations were taken from the 2013 Census Data estimates, and county-level characteristics were taken from 2010 Census Data estimates.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:Age-adjusted population density was not a significant predictor of low-energy mechanisms (p=0.1063); however, median county age was a significant predictor in the model (p=0.0340). The model was a significant (p=0.0173). Age-adjusted population density was not a significant predictor of high-energy mechanisms (p=0.8271). Median age was not a significant predictor (p=0.8218), and the model was not significant (0.9433).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Both low-energy and high-energy mechanisms do not appear to be linearly correlated with population density after adjustment for median county age. The data suggest that both trauma mechanisms appear to occur independent of population density in Florida.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Wilson<sup>1</sup>  <sup>1</sup>Howard University College Of Medicine,Washington, DC, USA","<strong>Introduction</strong>: All who sustain open fractures may present with isolated musculoskeletal injuries or multisystem trauma putting them at risk for complications.  Research is limited regarding the association between open tibia fractures and mortality; what exists suggests the two are not intrinsically linked.  We sought to assess the factors which impact perioperative mortality after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of isolated open tibia fractures (IOTF) using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB).<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A retrospective analysis of the NTDB from 2007-2010 utilizing ICD-9 codes was conducted.  Patients &ge; 18 years, who underwent ORIF of IOTF at a level I or II trauma centers were included.  Those excluded were cases who died in the emergency department and those who were dead on arrival.  Multivariate logistic regression analyzed covariates including, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), injury severity score (ISS), congestive heart failure, and age.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: 7,201 cases met the inclusion criteria.  The majority were White (67%), males (74%), ages 25-44 years (42%), injured due to a motor vehicle collisions (25%), with private insurance (23%).  1.01% (n=73) of patients in our cohort died within 30 days of surgery.  Among the mortalities 54 were White, 24 were female and 21 were 65 years or older.  Having fixation on hospital day (HD) 1 increased odds of death (OR: 2.46 Cl: 1.05-5.78 p=0.038), compared to having fixation by HD 2. Insurance, race, gender, and GCS were not associated with perioperative death (Table 1), however the elderly were six times more likely to die (OR: 6.05 CI: 2.07-17.69 p&lt;0.001).  Patients with an ISS between 16-24 &amp; 25-75 were five times (OR: 5.14 CI: 2.14-12.39 p&lt;0.001) and more than nine times (OR: 9.67 CI: 4.08-22.94 p&lt;0.001) more likely to die. Among comorbidities analyzed only those with congestive heart failure (CHF) had increased odds of death (OR: 9.32 CI: 3.00-28.94 p&lt;0.001).  Patients with any perioperative complication were almost three times more likely to die after surgery (OR: 2.9 CI: 1.57-5.36 p=0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While the number of deaths among patients with isolated open tibia fractures was relatively small across the study period, many would argue that even one percent constitutes too many lives lost.  GCS was not predictive of perioperative mortality, however, increasing ISS was predictive likely due to multisystem trauma.   The elderly had a disproportionately higher odds of death compare to all other age groups.   Analyzing more recent data might offer additional insight into the potential persistence of the results found here and identification of any modifiable factors to decrease perioperative death after ORIF of open tibia fractures.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

However, the role of change in GCS score as a prognostic indicator in these patients has never been studied before. We hypothesized that change in GCS score at 6-hours after arrival reliably predicts mortality and need for delayed neurosurgical intervention in patients with TBI.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: We performed a 2-year (2013-2014) retrospective analysis of all patients with a diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage on initial CT scan. We divided our patient population into 2 groups, patients with unchanged or improved 6-hour GCS score and patients with a decline in GCS scores. Our primary outcome measures were; mortality, delayed craniotomy (&gt; 6-hour), and progression of intracranial bleed. Secondary outcome measures were; hospital and ICU length of stay. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:A total of 232 patients were included. Mean age was 45.8&plusmn;25.2 years and median head-AIS was 3 [3-4]. 138 (58.5%) patients had an improved 6-hour GCS score as compared to their admission GCS score. The rates of mortality (2.4% vs. 18.1; p&lt;0.001), delayed craniotomy (0.8% vs. 11.4%; p=0.001), and progression of head bleed (6.3% vs. 16.2%; p=0.02) were significantly lower in the patients with improved 6 hour-GCS scores. Improved 6-hour GCS score was independently associated with lower odds of mortality (OR [CI]; 0.1 [0.02-0.53]; p=0.007). Even in the subgroup of severe TBI patients, an improved 6-hour GCS score was independently associated with lower odds of mortality (OR [CI]; 0.09 [0.01-0.81], p=0.03)<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:An improvement in 6-hour GCS following traumatic brain injury is associated with lower odds of mortality. This may help direct critical decisions in patients in whom the prognosis following traumatic brain injury is unclear.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

We hypothesized that psychiatric diagnoses would be common in patients hospitalized for trauma in the United States and that this diagnosis would be associated with poor outcomes. <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS, 2012) was used to determine national estimates for the number of patients admitted with an injury. Psychiatric diagnoses were identified using diagnosis codes according to the Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed.  Survey weights were used to derive national estimates.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 1.96 million patients were admitted to hospitals in the United States in 2012 due to trauma.  Of these, 861,160 (44%) had a psychiatric diagnosis.  This rate was higher when compared to non-trauma inpatients (11.3 million/34.5 million, 33%, p &lt;0.001).  Psychiatric diagnoses varied by age group.  For those &lt;18 years, neurodevelopmental disorders were the most common (41%).  For ages 18-64, drug and alcohol abuse predominated (41%), while dementia and related disorders (48%) were the most common in adults &ge;65.  Drug and alcohol abuse were common in both those &lt;18 years (14%) and adults &ge;65 years (12%). Patients hospitalized for trauma who had a psychiatric diagnosis differed in all measures compared to those without a psychiatric diagnosis.  On average those with a psychiatric diagnosis were older (62 vs. 58 years, p&lt;0.001), more often female (53% vs. 49%, p&lt;0.001), more often white (74% vs. 68%, p&lt;0.001), and less severely injured (mean ISS 8.8 vs. 9.6, p&lt;0.001). Mortality was low for all trauma patients, but was lower for trauma patients that had a psychiatric diagnosis in both unadjusted and adjusted analysis (2.0% vs. 3.1%, OR 0.55, p&lt;0.001).  However, patients with a psychiatric diagnosis were more often discharged to skilled nursing care (42% vs. 32%, p&lt;0.001) and less often to home (42% vs. 50%, p&lt;0.001).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Psychiatric conditions are present in almost &frac12; of all hospitalized trauma patients in the United States, which is more common than what is observed in hospitalized non-trauma patients. The most common diagnosis was drug and alcohol abuse. Psychiatric diagnoses were associated with a greater number of discharges to skilled nursing facilities rather than home, suggesting an increased burden by those with a psychiatric diagnosis. The frequency of psychiatric conditions in the trauma population suggests efforts should be made to address this component of patient health to improve outcomes.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Trauma/Critical Care"

Existing studies to address this issue lack the ability to reliably adjust for disease-specific and procedure-specific variables that may significantly influence treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with postoperative death/stroke following surgical clipping for brain aneurysm.  <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:   A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing surgical clipping for ICA repair was conducted using the multi-institutional American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Project (ACS NSQIP) participant use file (2006-2013). The primary outcome measure was a composite variable, 30-day death or stroke (30dDS). Patient, disease, and procedure characteristics were compared using the Chi-square test. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to determine the factors associated with 30dDS.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:  A total of 974 adult patients were identified for inclusion during the 8-year study period. The overall 30dDS was 12.7% with 63 deaths and 80 strokes. In the multivariate model, patients with hypertension requiring antihypertensive medication, or in a coma state prior to the operation were noted to have a significantly higher risk of 30dDS (OR=2.4, 95% CI 1.2-5.1 and OR=6.8, 95% CI 2.2-22.8 respectively).<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Preoperative hypertension requiring antihypertensive medication and coma status are independently associated with 30dDS in patients undergoing open surgery for ICA. Hypertension and state of unconsciousness should be considered as priority risk factors in management of ICA, regardless of other medical comorbidities. These factors should be a part of the preoperative discussion when getting informed consent.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Here we investigate how patient demographics and co-morbidities stratify differences in brain volume prior to and following carotid intervention.<br><br><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients scheduled to undergo a carotid intervention were prospectively recruited under an IRB-approved protocol at a single academic center. Both patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) were included. All subjects underwent pre- and post-operative MRI that included a T1 structural sequence. The T1 images were processed using FreeSurfer 5.3, with resulting segmentations reviewed and edited as needed under neuroradiologist supervision. Demographics were collected and analyzed to look for correlations with derived brain volumetrics.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>:48 patients were recruited to the study; 42 completed all procedures and were included in the analysis. 99% of the patients were male with an average age of 70 years. As expected, older patients had smaller brain volume and larger ventricles. No significant relationships were found between change in brain segment volumes and procedure type (CAS vs. CEA), current smoking, or prior neurologic symptoms. History of alcohol abuse correlated with a decrease in caudal middle frontal volume (p=.04). Diabetics were found to experience a significant decrease in contralateral segment volumes, including the thalamus (p=.06), anterior cingulate (p=.01), and caudal middle frontal (p=.04) regions. Similarly, a relationship was found between patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and a decrease in contralateral isthmus cingulate (p=.01) and rostral middle frontal volumes (p=.05). These changes were not replicated on the ipsilateral side, suggesting that revascularization may mitigate the effect of diabetes and CAD on brain structure.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>:Volumetric MRI data may provide insight on the impact of carotid interventions on the brain. Further work investigating this relationship is warranted.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Vascular"

Interest in XRT has recently grown due to the ability to deliver focused high doses of XRT.  We aimed to evaluate and synthesize the recent published data regarding HCC and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). <br><br><strong>Methods</strong>:  A systematic literature search using a predefined protocol was utilized to identify publications of XRT and HCC in PubMed, Ovid Medline, Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), and Cochrane Library (2000-2015). Primary outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS) and toxicity associated with SBRT.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: From a pool of 5,064 articles, 10 involving SBRT were retained for data extraction consisting of 5 retrospective cohort studies, 4 prospective observational studies and 1 prospective phase 2 trial. A total of 565 patients were identified of which 404 were male (72%). Median OS range was 11-41 months, while 1-, 2- and 3- year OS rates ranged from 50-95%, 43-83%, and 23-70%, respectively. Objective tumor response rates of 63-86% and progression of disease at follow-up was documented in 0-8% of cases. Grade 3/4 toxicities due to SBRT were observed in 0-26%, and RILD was observed in 11 patients (2%) with 3 deaths from liver failure.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: SBRT for HCC lesions may offer an effective therapy in selective cases.  With encouraging OS outcomes and infrequent reported hepatic toxicity, XRT represents a potential treatment for inoperable patients.","Outcomes/Clinical",,"Oncology"
